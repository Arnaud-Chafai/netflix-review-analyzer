Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Went from a promising dark teen series to a total train wreck,"The series starts strong in the first season with interesting characters and a dark tone, that the original didn't have. But sadly it all goes down quickly for an almost lighthearted goofy series at the end, including lots of singing and dancing and mysterious strong characters turning into silly shadows of themselves at the end. Characters who have had a strong goal seem to just be carried away to a point of just existing for the sake of being there. Character development jumps back and forth, in one episode they feel this way, in another they feel the opposite and so on. Furthermore the story becomes more ridiculous on every episode leading to a total train wreck that is the finale.

I really recommend the first season and then just forget that there are three more to watch."

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Part 1 and 2 were awesome, now part 3 is turned into some cheesy teen pop musical series","Why did they have to kill all the nice dark chills this show had in part 3? How did they even suppose it'll be a good thing to kill what the show was and was loved by us the audience for and turn it into some cheesy teen pop musical instead? I see no logic in ruining something that was just right and had a fan base and turn it into something very different by adding these repulsive scenes that were almost never in the previous two parts and totally changing the feel of the show. I'm disappointed, I loved the previous parts, but now since part 3's 2nd episode I am not even sure if I want to continue watching it, too much cringe. It seems like this cheesy teen singing stuff just killed it for me. Thanks a lot for ruining yet another good series that had great potential."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,What's wrong with season 3?,Why Sabrina is a musical now? I am very disappointed.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Mixed bag,"The first two seasons are exceptional, the third and fourth seasons descend into poorly written madness. Overall, I'd say I'm glad I watched but also glad its over. Decent acting and good cinematography throughout."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Seasons 1 & 2 are great. Season 3 is bad.,"The first two seasons are great. Great writing, great theming, great plots, music and mood is excellent. Even the acting is really good. Then at the very last episode of season 2 you can just feel what's coming, it's like everyone is thinking, wow, our show is really popular now and we can just do whatever we want next season. The first episode of season 3 is total cornball. The music is stupid. The acting is cheesy/corny. The writing is awful. It's like the show went directly from Netflix to Nickelodeon. I don't know if all the producers and writers walked away or what happened but the show just sucks now. We literally had to step away from a show that we blissfully binge watched for two seasons and that saddens me."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,The final episode cost it a star,A very entertaining show with a great lead and supporting cast. Bringing in the two actresses who played Sabrina's aunt's in the TV show (which I never watched) was a great Easter egg. But the finale was a downer and felt rushed.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Part 3 what?,Was so excited for the part 3 release but was disappointed quickly. So much going on everywhere in part 3 it was hard to keep my attention. Hopeful for a part 4 comeback as this series still has potential somewhere.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,A Watered-down Version of a Stellar Horror Comic,"IMDb crashed and deleted my long review, so :'''))) I'm going to keep this short: I understand why fans of ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" are rating this series so highly, because they think it's a fresh and exciting take, however, this is a poor adaptation of the actual comic this is based on, a horror comic titled ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Moving past the fresh and exciting ideas of the comic, it's not a compelling representation of them.

This series waters down SO much. In the original comic, there was a heavy emphasis on Sabrina's aunts being cannibals, graphic scenes of Hell and Satanic rituals, nudity and gore were EVERYWHERE. It immediately set a legitimate horror tone for the comic, whereas you never get the feeling in this tv show like something bad might happen to the characters. It feels too ""nice"" and like an obvious tv production, like Riverdale. There's not the same standard of narrative tension.


-They also jumble up the story wildly (and remove some of the best aspects) from the comic - I assume to stretch it out so they can add them in later. And while you can argue that this is an adaptation and it doesn't need to be the same, the point is that it's not better - in fact, it's less interesting. For an example - this isn't even a spoiler because its not in the show - in the comic, Harvey follows Sabrina to her dark baptism and get murdered/eaten by witches (and then brought back to life through necromancy). But the point of him being there was incredibly important to **certain** decisions for Sabrina, and it's exciting (hello!! murdering the love interest and then necromancy? awesome). But they just cut it out. And the resulting scene is just, less important for her as a character, and its duller

-There are storylines inserted (mainly high school drama ones) that add nothing to the show other than confusing its tone.

-Netflix shows should have the luxury of ""showing"" not ""telling"" and allowing for a more cinematic experience. I couldn't count the number of times that people's backstories and personalities were just explained through dialogue instead of showing us.



Overall, there are positives about this series (set design is good, it is also atmospheric in places, and I don't mind the actors), but when you really look at this series, it plays like Riverdale, which is """"okay"""" if they're pandering to a younger audience, but this series could have been something GREAT in the vein of more serious adaptations like the Haunting of Hill House. I highly recommend that if you're unsure about what I'm talking about, read the comic series ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"", because it's definitely more arresting than this."

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Disappointing.,Plenty of potential but a bit boring. I find the 10/10 scores a bit much.
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,So much wasted potential.,"In the beginning this show was a breath of fresh air. The sets and overall visual style of the show created such a rich atmosphere and the story was enthralling to watch. Witch shows are rarely this dark and satanic but it worked.

Unfortunately, each season the writing/story got worse, not better. In the end, season 4 was an empty, boring mess. I actually get why Netflix cancelled it because the quality of the writing had drastically decreased with every season and the expensive budget surely wasn't feasible any longer considering people have definitely stopped watching.

This is the second show that Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa has now destroyed with his horrible writing/pacing. He's quickly becoming one of those showrunners who cannot sustain good storytelling throughout a series run."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,As the episodes go further my interest go lower,"At the beginning I was amazed by show, loved the touch of horror and crime, loved the conflict between aunties/sisters Zelda and Hilda. But, few last episodes were boring mainly because of main character Sabrina. Why she can't be smart, wicked, good and bad in same time. They had to ruin her with '' choose help from stranger, over your own family?! "" seriously?! Waiting for season 2 to see if they will change the way how they will proceed with Sabrina character. The rest of the characters are amazingly good written."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"So, so bad",I wanted to love this show . I was completely fine with it not being like the sitcom . I love dark shows and witches but Sabrina is so annoying . The writing is so corny and Sabrina and Zelda speak so stuck up. Not because of Zelda's accent . When Sabrina goes of on her little rants her voice gets so uppity. And she's a terrible actor . Also do we really need to get political ? No one in high school acts like this . Sooooo bad
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Not bad, but a little on the annoying side","After recently reading the comics of the same title, I was extremely excited for this series. I found it a refreshing spin on the original 90's version, which was cute but I was never that in to it. But, honestly you really can't call this a remake. My biggest issues are with Sabrina's annoying damn friends. This ridiculous obsession with Harvey and the hypocrisy that is her ""i don't want to join the club but i want the benefits"" mindset. Like it exhausting watching her put her friends and family in danger constantly and then turn around and say she's doing it all so that she can maintain her freedom. Overall i still like the show and some of the main characters, but it's a bit tiresome watching Sabrina's silly character run all over the place."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,"Poor direction,no storyline, confusing title. pathetic show","Why did u do it netflix ? why ? why did u take our fav show frm childhood & ruined it beyond recovery. Riverdale itself is a mediocre show & d same director for sabrina. I don know where to start d show is nothin about magic , spells , good visuals or for dat matter a storyline.The visuals are cheap as if its shot in a freaking tent !. The actings skills of most of the actors including sabrina sometimes not dat fascinating. It could have been a beautiful show instead one having cheap background scenes , overacting, 0 storyline & poor poor direction. Even if its a new adaptation & not a remake it could have been so mch more about the witches & spells & magic rather than js a girl trying to prove her point & claim her freedom.How is that witchery ? Not sure what they are trying to show. Bad bad bad show man"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Pulpy and Entertaining,"I've enjoyed both seasons, but the second really got cooking about half way through. Very much looking forward to the next two seasons."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,liked the concept but characters are annoying,"I really liked the idea, but Sabrina annoys me with her ""why can't I"" superiority and I need to put my boyfriend above everything, including family. Maybe it's because she's a teenager but I don't know... Not really a fan... Other characters are okay I suppose"
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Chilling,"I recently finished all the episodes. It was a dark mood from the beginning to end, i was very much excited to watch every new episodes. The perfomance of the character who played Sabrina was outstanding and nothing to say about it . At the last episode my heartbeat raised and felt a dark. After all it was a wonderful series."

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Refreshingly Different,"This is my first review and deservingly so. Its cheeky, daramatic, pleasantly gory, and it has perfect moments of needed comedy. NETFLIX did a great job with this one."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,I was expecting more,"I was excited based on previews but after the pilot I don't think I can watch anymore. The ""what year is this"" idea is fun and I've seen it used successfully elsewhere but it doesn't really work here (it's the 1960s, but woke!). Sabrina is played in a very polished, actor-ly way, which works against the dark vibe the show is otherwise trying to establish."
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Season 3 ruined the series,Season 3 is Scooby Doo meets Highs School Musical. The musical numbers that are jammed into the episodes make no sense
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,Couldn't even finish the first episode,"I glanced over an article a few days ago that said this show was worth watching, so I decided to go for it. They were wrong.

Not even 30 minutes in and there is already more talk about patriarchy, masculinity, white privilege and other far left buzzwords than about anything that the series is supposedly about. If that's your cup of tea, then I see no reason why you wouldn't like this show. But if you don't like far left ideology being pushed as some sort of irreproachable moral standard, then this show might not be for you.

I decided to stop watching after about 25 minutes. But by all means, watch the first episode and see for yourself."

Silence Is Welcome,,
The Little Vampire 3D,Pretty Average,"This movie isn't anything special. The story and villain wasn't compelling, and the sound quality made bits confusing and hard to follow. At least the animation was certainly better than I thought. The romantic chemistry between the boys was enjoyable to watch, and pretty much saves the movie. Considering it's for kids, it's a fairly acceptable and average adaptation from the books."
The Little Vampire 3D,"You know how to whistle, don't you?",Comentario no disponible
The Little Vampire 3D,A vampire movie for the kids without all the blood sucking...,"This animated movie actually turned out much better than I had anticipated. But then again, I had very little expectations to it, because I hadn't heard about it prior to finding it by blind luck.

I sat down to watch this with my, then 7 year old, son. And we were both quiet adequately entertained.

The story is entertaining and quite well written. However, if one is to point any critical fingers, then there weren't as many laughs as one could have hoped for. But still a great movie nonetheless.

The CGI animation was quite nice with lots of detail in every scene. And that definitely lifted the movie up quite a notch in terms of it being enjoyable and watchable.

""The Little Vampire"" is certainly a movie that is quite suitable for the kids, without it being too much. There are no horror elements to it, so it is quite child-friendly."
The Little Vampire 3D,Serviceable adaptation of the beloved children's novels,"I loved as a kid the Little Vampire books by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg. This is a free adaptation that doesn't really follow the novels, except some of the basic ideas, like the friendship between the mortal boy and the vampire boy and how traditional and old-fashioned the vampire family was. I felt the story here was weaker than in the novels. They tried to fit it too much to the standard action/adventure animated film model. I don't know, maybe a more faithful adaptation would have been too slow-paced for the intended audience, but it lost part of the character and individuality of the story., although some of it remains The adults were extremely passive/ineffectual for no good reason other than allowing the child characters to shine.

The funny parts were not so funny, including several scatological jokes involving cow poo.

The animation was basic. I liked the character designs, but the movement and backgrounds was not that good, compared with other recent animated movies. There was a lot of flying around by the vampire characters that maybe would look better in 3D (I saw this on TV).

All in all, an entertaining enough movie that should please child viewers, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that it might have been better. Rating: 6/10."
The Little Vampire 3D,"Too childishly, even for children","If the cartoon touches on a serious topic (like ""lets go to fry these vampires""), then it's not just a children's cartoon, with farewell nonsense or flat humor (in the adult's understanding), but in this cartoon the level of humor and the behavior of the characters leaves much to be desired. And honestly, I believe that showing children ""stupid adults"" or ""stupid villains"" is wrong: Don't teach children a low-level understanding about people, they CAN understand a lot of things, just give them a chance. Such cartoons don't do that."
The Little Vampire 3D,An unlikely teen bromance,"So cute and safe it's missing the horror-vampire theme completely, but then there's the friendship/bromance level that makes it all worth watching :)"
The Little Vampire 3D,Wanted to like this but Tonys voice was annoying.,"I came here to find out why, turns out he was voiced by a woman. It's just grating and got on my nerves quick. Rest of the movie was ok, if they would have gotten an actual boy to play a boy, would have been better."
The Little Vampire 3D,Nice enough,"I Actually liked this movie, The fact that some people think its bad because it would tend your kids to the dark side should put more time in parenting and less in writing reviews. the story isn't really strong but fun to watch at. Beware to teach your kid that this movie is fiction and make sure to have a great time watching it. remember no tonics and sweets that is bad for your kid ;)"
The Little Vampire 3D,Awful,"Weak characters and poor dialogue, terrible all round. The only positive is the animation"
The Little Vampire 3D,Low expectations meant the movie turned out to be good.,Comentario no disponible
The Little Vampire 3D,"""A Boys Discovery""","Awful watch, won't watch and can't recommend, even for younger audiences.

The best thing about this movie is how awful the villain is, it's like if Van Helsing was a jerk and vampires were all nice.

The sister is at least interesting, wrestling between cultures, but that is immediately trumped by child vampires. One of the most horrific versions of vampires is trapping someone in a 13 year old body for centuries, and they play it off as a laugh, as if he is 13.

In some versions, vampires are biological enough that they birth, giving a ""pure"" blood line (""Blade""), or can mate with humans under the right conditions, but either that is a Dampir or a human. It is VERY unclear what is happening here so I'm left with this clan regularly indoctrinates children into their vampire society to mimic human culture.

Then we have species jumping, where an animal gets infected (watch ""Bunnicula"" for a better version).

And then we have the dual homo erotic adventures, and I'm not even against it, but it is weirder than ""Top Gun"", at least it made sense those two were into each other. But the mortal is clearly into the vampire boy, and they write in the crush on the girl to normalize him to the audience, but it looks more like he's into both.

And the poor ginger guy, his boyfriend wakes him up in the middle of the night to go on this adventure and doesn't appreciate him the whole time.

This is clearly made by people that had a lot of money to make it well, and had a clear list of demands. It was given to a writer than saw it was garbage and clearly beneath him and decided to show the producers what they did. So, because he was good enough to, made this horrible thing he was asked to do, but in the least acceptable way that would be accepted and still be good enough not to sink his career. And I'm sure it still got noted to death.

Just steer away from this one. Vampires shouldn't be lovable characters in the same way humans are, they can stand on their own. Bring back powerful blood drinking characters."
The Little Vampire 3D,Lovely. this movie should get more recognition.,"I loved this movie and the cute romance between the 2 boys. to the makers of this movie, we would love to see movies like these in the future. keep up the great work."
The Little Vampire 3D,Lovely wee movie but,Horrendous sound quality! They used some kind of filter especially for the scenes in the castle with the vampire clan. So difficult to make out the dialogue. All levels wrong. Shame as otherwise it seemed a decent enough movie for the kids.
The Little Vampire 3D,"If you root for criminals and despise law enforcement, this is for you.",Comentario no disponible
The Little Vampire 3D,No Subtitles,"Positives: Negatives: 1. A movie mostly for kids and they offer no subtitles! I guess teaching to read or to help those who have difficulties hearing is not important. 2. Not creative storytelling - been done many times before. 3. Animation quality was poor, e.g. all backgrounds were static painted such as clouds, grass, branches, human hair nothing alive & moving. The exception was the basic, in-the-foreground, human body movements were natural."
The Little Vampire 3D,Its a kids movie and do you know how to whistle?,"I found this movie on Netflix while trying to find a movie for my daughter and get past the blood sucking that's off camera it not violent. But it obviously a kids movie. And it has mood swings like a lady pregnant with a baby one moment a character is happy and then one moment he tried to attack him. And the other he's trying to be nice the other he's being a dick. So to a kid how has no care of what he's watching it's great, good kids movie but I am 23 so its not as pleasant to watch am not that old but old enough to not like this movie. But my 7 year old daughter loves it."
The Little Vampire 3D,"Too dark for children, characters unlikeable",This is one of the worst movies I have endured on our family friday night movie session. It is dark the whole way through. The characters are either: gruff and mean or weak and submissive. The animation is good but the rest is terrible. I think my kids will be scarred for life from this film. Terrible
The Little Vampire 3D,Amazing 10/10,"Hi lovelies,

The movie is amazing. From the beautiful accents to the blossoming love and friendship between the characters. It was absolutely amazing to watch it. The storyline is exciting and I like the dark theme surrounding the movie. I would love for the movie to have a sequel. The voice actors did an amazing job!

This is a must see movie!

Kind Regards,

Suman :)"

The Little Vampire 3D,I'm gonna be honest it's better than the 2000 movie,"I know this sounds pretty insane and ridiculous but that's my opinion and to make it more insane. I never liked the 2000 movie like, Vampires turning into humans? I'm sorry but I don't think no vampire ever wants to turn into human.

Anyway, I like the characters, the animation is good, I like the little jokes, the voice actors did a good job

I give this 10 stars!!!"
The Little Vampire 3D,"Beautiful story, faboulous production design and animation with wonderful 3D","The 3D stereoscopic effects are just perfect, why this film is not more well known is a complete mystery to me, I find it very sad that a film that has so much creative talent on display has not reached the audience it deserves I highly recommend that you seek out is incredible animated film, even adults will love it."
The Little Vampire 3D,Fun movie,This was a fun movie! My family and I enjoyed it very much. It was so funny!
The Little Vampire 3D,It's a kids movie,"Hello parents and Rotten Tomato critics. I'd like to start off by saying, that this is an animated revival movie of an already very underground and niche kids movie. I saw a Rotten Tomato critic say that the convoluted storyline will fly over the heads of kids. Who the hell calls a kids movie convoluted, what kind of person does that? I had to look up the godamn word and I'm an adult. The movie has such refreshing character design, it reminds me almost of the movie ""Daddy, Im a zombie"" Which is such a good classic to me. To whoever is leaving harsh reviews on this movie, deserves a fat thumbs down."
The Little Vampire 3D,"Pretty good, Movie for real vampire fans ONLY!","Okay, first of all have you seen the COW? That was pretty awesome, Tony and his vampire boyfriend trek through the woods of germany (I LOVE GERMANY!!) and are chased around by a gruesome twosome of attempted child murderers, while i do not condone their actions. In surviving and escaping these two, the boys formed a sort of subtextual romantic tension that is clear to literally everyone who sees the movie. It's sort of sweet, the movie feels the need to show that Tony is not in fact gay, by making him like a girl. But this is to distract from the fact the homies truly are in love. I'm watching this from the perspective of just some person watching random dutch movies, but i'm sure kids would like it too, it's not too impressive, but it impressed me with it's stunning cow."
The Little Vampire 3D,Totally passionate...,"How cute, I was more lazy to watch this animation, and it was cuter than I imagined, it lost a little breath in the third act, but it conquers and makes our hearts warm with cute messages and the characters totally passionate...."
Umrika,,
Young Wallander,It was good until the end.,"The writers got lazy, and just ended the season abruptly. Very disappointed. But the acting and the storyline up until the last episode was really good. I still think I would watch it even with the disappointing ending because the storyline and the characters are really well done. I'm just disappointed with the ending."
Young Wallander,Integrity to consistency missing,"The fans of the previous two Wallander series that tuned in to Young Wallander are bound to be disappointed that the new series timeframe is not consistent with that of its predecessors. Adam Palsson is a good actor and does well carrying the lead in this presentation. In keeping with the first two series the timeframe would've had to be the 70's.......for those too young to know, cell phones were a good 20-30 years away. Young Wallander uses a smart phone, looks like an iPhone. They easily could've called this series something other than Wallander which would have in no way impacted the premise of the show. So why call it a Wallander where comparisons would obviously be made....except for reasons of drawing a ready made audience. I am watching this series independent of the lead character growing into the older version of Kurt Wallander."
Young Wallander,Not the same Wallander but worth a watch,"I was hoping that this series would be set in the past like Endeavor/Morse but sadly, this is not going to tell us the moody, brooding backstory of Kurt Wallander. It is a little too modern for my taste, but we watched it anyway.

The action seems to move along at a decent pace and tells the story well. Kurt makes some judgment errors yet seems to be a competent (though learning his way) as a new detective. The series isn't a typical gloomy Scandi Noir nor a fast-paced UK cop show, but this one stands on its own.

(This is a British production, NOT American. The British series was set in Sweden and performed by British actors, as is this one. The Swedish series was set in Sweden and has Swedish dialogue.) Swedes are NOT Swiss."
Young Wallander,An odd beast,This is made by Yellow Bird UK and other than the lead actor who is Swedish the cast is British. It's also set in the present which means it serves as neither a prequel to the British or Swedish series. It's also not filmed in Sweden like the other series but in Lithuania. It's not a bad show but it just doesn't feel like Wallander.
Young Wallander,"Gritty, edgy detective show!","I never read the books so I didn't really know what to expect from Young Wallander but I ended up liking it quite a bit. It's a gritty, edgy police detective show that will keep you entertained throughout the series!"
Young Wallander,It's OK,"Being a Swede, I'm not overly excited with an English speaking Wallander, however it's still a decent series to spend your time with on a rainy day. But I would have enjoyed it better if it was in Swedish cause it's a Swedish character. Also for everybody who doesn't know, Sweden and Swiss are two different countries;) Not many non European people seems to know this."
Young Wallander,Why in English so many Brits in the cast?,I am a Brit but disappointed that this could not be made in Swedish and with a Swedish cast.
Young Wallander,It's an impressive series.,"A young Wallander begins his career in criminal detection.

I found it a little slow to begin with, but once it gets going, it's a very good series, the stories are very good, it's well produced, and very, very well acted, Adam Pålssonis really great in the title role.

I must address one issue, Young Wallander, the title, makes me think of an origin story, it implies Wallander in his youth, be it The Swedish or English adaptation, instead it's set in present day, with very much present day themes. Is he Wallander in name only? After this first series I'll be honest, that's how I see it, maybe if a further run is made my opinion may well change. The name Wallander will of course attract viewers. How cool would it have been if it were set in the 90's.

It is definitely worth watching, I really would recommend it, if you like me are worried that your favourite Detective shows are ended, or are coming to an end, such as Endeavour and Vera, this offers new life, and a fresh look at one of the best, Wallander.

It's an English made series, set in Sweden, filmed in Lithuania, I can imagine our friends in Sweden are a little surprised.

Thoroughly enjoyed it, 8/10."
Young Wallander,barely ok..,"This is coming from having seen both the Swedish Wallander (Krister Henriksson) series (which is the best) and the UK Wallander (Kenneth Brannagh) series (which is also very good), and watched only one of the Swedish movies with Rolf Lassgård (as the others are hard to come by).

First, Young Wallander is set in current day, which is the first thing which already is a problem. Going into it expecting a real prequel set at the end of the 60's or early 70's and seeing a brand spanking new volvo already gave me a WTF, then seeing a mobile phone made me really think WTF is this.... Ok, then I just adjusted my expectations, but it surely was not what I expect from a 'Young Wallander'. I think they did it to keep the costs down, as a period piece is much more expensive, and with in mind if it's successful they can still go on for many years and still keeping the costs down.

Second, even though the actor looks great, his voice is really annoying, as he sounds like he has an astma problem or out of breath every single time he opens his mouth. Krister, Kenneth and even Rolf never sounded so hoarse. And the other problem is what's point three...

Third, English. Even though Kenneth Brannagh's version was completely in english, it wasn't really a problem, but in this version it's clear Adam Pålsson is not a native english speaker and it shows, it's the second thing about this actor which makes it not so great to watch him play, he has a very thick accent while the rest of the cast hasn't.. They should have just cast an english actor or done the whole series in original swedish (latter would have been my preference). Now it really annoyes the hell with the actor AND speaking hoarse AND having a bad accent.

I think it might be based on the book in which it has 5 stories about his youth, but if it is, it just wasn't really translated well by the creators of this series.. It is clear Henning Mankell wasn't involved himself in this series like he was in the previous incarnations. For a 6 parter I think it just dragged on too much, this story could have fit much better as a 1 hour and 30 minutes episode like the Henriksson and Brannagh series had done. I'm still gonna watch any new season as I'm just a sucker for detectives, but I still think it's a shame they botched this a bit by the miscast of this actor (pure based on his voice/accent, not his acting itself)."
Young Wallander,Not Wallander,"""Young Wallander"" has nothing to do with Wallander, so it's pretty obvious that the creators are trying to just use a pretty internationally recognizable name to sell this show. My guess: they probably changed the name because it couldn't stand on it's own legs, so they just slapped ""Wallander"" on a script that initially was something else and everything points at this. Wallander is nothing like the Wallander we know. The creators explain this as (sic)""He hasn't become that cynical person yet."" They're Swedes in ""Sweden"" (filmed in Lithuania, with mostly British actors) but they speak English to appeal to a wider audience. Wallander is young i recent time, which obviously isn't right. The creators explain this with (sic)""Well, you have to bend your imagination..."" If the show actually was about a young Wallander in the Swedish '70s, actually filmed in Sweden, it would've been a very interesting take on the character. But this?.. They could've called it ""Young Batman"" and tell us to use our imagination."
Young Wallander,Adam Pålsson ...,... who plays the young Wallander are the perfect cast. After seeing the first 4 episode I like his acting and first link to the Wallander from the original novels and Swedish TV show. That the show are based not in the 70s underline the actuality of the story and makes it more interesting. We know the end of Wallander's life and I like the idea of how it all started. More like other shows.
Young Wallander,British and akward,Except for main character everyone is British and speaking English. Everyone is behaving like British. Nothing Swedish and original Wallander in this.
Young Wallander,Bad and lazy writing coupled with glorification of gang related criminality,"This was bad, really bad. Wallander keeps making stupid misstakes just for the sake of creating drama later on and thats lazy writing, something that i had hoped was behind us when it comes to TV-series these days. The depiction of the Malmoe gang criminality also leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Especially with how things are in real life Malmoe these days.

Theres tons of good shows out there, watch season 4 of Strike instead or Bosch."
Young Wallander,Swedish...in english,The person who decided the language in sweden should be english should lose his/hers job. If it was done in the original language it would have been way better.
Young Wallander,This show isn't bad at all.,"It's more a 7.5 for me. I find it likeable and interesting, not perfect, but good. Love Bashar ! Great acting. Other reviewers too harsh by far. Definitely worth a watch if you love crime / detective / British / euro / police shows."
Young Wallander,Really Not a Young Wallander.,"Timeline is way off! Smartphones, Laptops, 2019 Volvos... Is this a Kurt Wallander, Jr.?"
Young Wallander,Very good,"It's a good series, might be slow to some. I don't mind the pace of it, it seems more realistic, as I doubt many serious crimes get solved in a day. Hope it gets 3rd season ok."
Young Wallander,Very nice screenplay,I have seen all the first season at once. I could not stop. The storyline is very well written and the actors have a lot of carisma. Im
Young Wallander,So sad and stupid,"Why English? Wallander is Swedish and this is just stupid. Nothing authentic, nothing worth watching. Adam Pålsson is such a great actor. Waste of space. Anybody should be able to read subtitles. Keep the original language and keep the character. Sad."
Young Wallander,The whole charm of wallander was him being an awkward Swed,"I loved wallander & hace seen all of his original Swedish series. The whole charm was his awkward yet brilliant character. Swedish culture, Their way of interaction, dark yet beautiful nature. Pål the Danish actor Playing wallander has done great danish roles But this one isn't a convincing character for him. Should have left it scandi cast & original Svensk language"
Young Wallander,Terrible,"Anyone who has lived in Sweden can easily tell this entire setting isn't Swedish...leave alone the not speaking Swedish, the accent is completely off... Everything just doesn't fit Sweden..."
Young Wallander,It is a young Wallander. I like it after took a short deep breath.,"May be the writers/producers got the attention they wanted. If you took the hook of the name of the show and you were already a Wallander stories fan, I think is normal you're pisssed off. It was hard to place young Wallander in like 30 years ago scenario. I believe there are signs of the young behaviour of Wallander character in this actual story. After all this is a very young Wallander he's still getting his full ""charm""."
Young Wallander,More of a reboot than a prequel,"This series is centred on Kurt Wallander, a young police officer in the Swedish city of Malmo. One day he witnesses an horrific crime on the estate where he lives... a young man, with a Swedish flag painted on his face, has been tied up with tape over his mouth; another man removes the tape revealing a grenade which explodes seconds later. This leads to him being moved to the serious crimes unit. The crime leads to tensions rising as many seek to blame the migrant community; following leads will put Kurt in real danger and uncovering a variety of secrets.

This series main surprises have nothing to do with the plot; it is in English not Swedish and more surprisingly it is set in the present so is a reboot for the character rather than a prequel to the stories we've seen before. Once one gets past this the story is solid if not too original. There are some decent twists as the story progresses and some genuinely tense moments... we might know Kurt isn't about to die but there is real danger for other characters. At only six episodes in length the series is quite short; hopefully there will be further seasons, the ending certainly felt like it was setting us up for more. Overall I wouldn't call this a must see series but it is a decent enough addition to the genre; at this point it isn't really linked to the older Wallander except for the character's name."
Young Wallander,this is many things but one thing it is NOT is young Wallander,"This has nothing to do with Wallander. They merely used his name to hook people in. The people who made this had a cop show and couldn't sell it so they paid someone to be able to use the name Wallander.

These people didn't even bother to watch/read the previous Wallanders. Wallander never lived in the projects. This is set in the present day it should be 80s or 70s.

This is a Bait and Switch I stopped watching after 5 minutes on principle. This might be a great cop show that I would have loved BUT this is not Young Wallander. I don't like being played so I won't give them the view."
Young Wallander,"Remove ""Wallander"" from it - its good","This is a great standalone detective series.

What lets it down, is its desperate attempt at credibility by linking it to the Wallander - a classic.

Not dissimilar to the Jack Ryan series Amazon Prime is doing - another great series if you just forget about the relationship to that person."
Moesha,Gotta Give UPN Credit,"I gotta give it to The WB and UPN. They aired quite a few Black-American shows that would otherwise not have seen the light of day. There was ""The Wayans Bros.,"" ""In the House,"" ""Parent 'Hood,"" ""Malcolm & Eddie,"" ""The Jamie Foxx Show,"" ""The Steve Harvey Show,"" ""Sister, Sister,"" and others. Among them was ""Moesha"" starring the singer Brandy.

""Moesha"" was right in my wheelhouse as a show. To me it was like the African-American answer to ""Blossom."" Brandy was a hip, stylish teen dealing with teen things; plus Brandy was huge at that time. She was putting out hits, so who wouldn't want to see her on screen--and she wasn't bad as an actress."
Moesha,Great until the college years,Comentario no disponible
Moesha,Ok show,"A decent Black youth coming- of age show. Real topics are approached in a realistic way for the most part, aside from once in awhile where the humor may be tacky. Also, as someone raised by a Jamaican family, Dee ( the stepmom)'s fake forced Jamaican accent is just painful."
Moesha,Slice of American Teen Life,"Moesha started off as a good little situation comedy with a difference: it was the first situation comedy centered around an African-American teenaged girl. Moesha, Hakeem, Kim and Niecy got into the usual trouble that teens on sitcoms do. However, it didn't always feel like the same old plot lines because of the appealing cast, at least in the first couple of seasons.

Unfortunately, the show decided to do continuing storylines, turning it more into a soap opera than a sitcom. I'm still wondering--who's bright idea it was to reveal that Moesha's dad Frank had an affair in the past that produced a son? It was sort of disturbing to see upstanding Frank's image tarnished, and the resulting fallout that happened afterwards. Then Countess Vaughn left to star in `The Parkers', and her character (Kim) was seldom referred to after that. Andell (Yvette Wilson), the owner of the café the teens hung out at, was unceremoniously hustled off the show (fortunately, she was placed on `The Parkers'), and her fiancee (Bernie Mac) disappeared, never to be heard about again. What was the deal with Dee (Sheryl Lee Ralph) taking a job in Jamaica during the last season? Other than a few appearances, her character virtually disappeared. All the drama involving Moesha's relationships with Q and Hakeem, and Dorian's (Brandy's real life brother, Ray J) brushes with the law became tiring.

Moesha was canceled with not one, but two major cliffhangers left unresolved-one involving a pregnancy and the other involving a kidnaping. A disappointing ending to a show that showed much promise in the beginning."

Moesha,Great show until the end,"This was one of the most watched sitcoms that garnered a huge African- American audience during it run on UPN. Originally is was supposed to start off as pilot for CBS in 1995,but instead UPN picked up the series and it did extremely well becoming the network's longest-running show which mainly came on Monday nights at the 8:00pm hour(which gave teens time to finish up their studies before the show came on). Moesha started out as a good little comedy,but its was Brandy and crew that kept the show going and it was the first to center around the everyday occurances of a African-American teenager(which Brandy's character Moesha Mitchell made the transition from high school to college during the show's run) but the show had so much more. From interactions with her parents Frank and Dee(played by William Faulk and Sheryl Lee Ralph) to rival sibling feuds with Myles,her closest friends who managed to get themselves in all kinds of trouble like Niecy and Kim(it was Niecy who join Moesha in college in later episodes) to her on again,off again relationships with Hakeem and Q and later on constant confrontations with her cousin Dorian (played by Brandy's real life brother Ray J) who was always in trouble with the law. This was a show that was funny at times,but most of the time you had to just follow along cause you'll never know what Brandy's character is thinking or doing whatever next. Very interesting show.

Unfortunately,Moesha was cancelled in 2001,but the show had two major cliffhangers that were left unsolved-including one that dealt with teen-marriage,one dealt with pregnancy,and the other involving a kidnapping and drugs. The final episode of the series ended on May 23,2001 which was an hour long episode that dealt with those issues including the showdown between Dorian and Frank and there interaction with a notorious drug lord (played by Master P),and the sudden fate of Moesha who runs off with her high school pal Q,and the fight scene where Hakeem and Q come to blows when they find out that Brandy's character is pregnant and Frank gets furious. As for Dee,she leaves for Jamaica....the end."
Moesha,coming of age,"This is an coming of age tale from the teen black female point of view Of living in Crenshaw. It was beautifully done. Brandy, countess Vaughn, and Sheryl lee Ralph really hold this show together. Brandy has a mixture of meg ryan and Julia Roberts and Michelle lee presence. She has the relatability factor going for her and truthfully feels like somebody you know whether it's your cousin , daughter , sister or friend.

I really liked the show, well acted, well directed, well written for the most part. The only weak point in the show is the actor playing frank Mitchell (Moesha's dad) i just never liked his portrayal and would've much preferred if Bernie mac played frank instead of uncle Bernie. He stronger chemistry with both brandy and Sheryl lee Ralph and would have been more believable as the supposed matured street wise Que."
Moesha,Moesha reboot needed,Black culture and an amazing role model!!!!!!! Brandys iconoc character give direction to a culture.
Moesha,Pretty good Show,"I am proud to say that I was a teenager in the late 90's and that I was a true product of a 90's teenager. In the 90's, we had a fair share of shows that focused on the lives of typical teenagers. We had the ""Fresh Prince,"" ""My So Called Life"" and even to a lesser extent, ""Blossom."" There was a little show that debuted in January 1996 on UPN called ""Moesha,"" featuring then a teenage singing sensation known to the world as Brandy. Who would know that this show would strike a chord with audiences and also become one of UPN's longest running series.

I would like to say that I thought ""Moesha"" was a very good show and it proves Brandy's strengths as an television actress. The characters were lovable, funny and charming but as with every sitcom this show wasn't without it's flaws. I felt at certain points this show kinda took itself to seriously by having too many dramatic episodes/moments. It seems as if every episode(especially during the first and last seasons) tried to take itself way too serious as it shouldn't have(especially in the first season with the ongoing subplot of Moesha not fully getting along with Dee). Well hey I guess this is what made ""Moesha"" work. Well the show was good while it lasted and I still catch it in reruns. Again, it's a pretty good show that is worthy to view at least once."
Moesha,Greatest tv show EVER!!!!,This show covered mainly all topics a adolescent to teenager deals with even today in 2021! It is the perfect coming of age tv show for a black female. But it includes ALL demographics. And I loved how it kept the ongoing required love between Akeem and Moesha!
Moesha,Moesha is a good tv shows too watch,Comentario no disponible
Moesha,Moesha was a classic,"Moesha was a classic show and it made an huge impact in my life. That show helped me make important decisions in life and it was a good show for all audience to watch. (I still watch the RE-RUNS)

Every season the show kept improving and the show talked about all kinds of issues that every teenagers or adults or young children can relate to. I truly think the reason why UPN was really popular during 1996-2001 is because of the show Moesha. Moesha had reached #1 as the highest rating show during the years. I don't think UPN had a show that last 6 straight season number 1. Many people who watches UPN must have watched Moesha. Either they like the show or not, it doesn't matter because the show Moesha became popular.

All those who think that Moesha is not a good show, must think again. They don't know anything about that show, all they do is hate. Haters might not like the show because Moesha was a sitcom that started very light and easy-going, and it ended with serious issues that people can relate to in life. Haters rather see the stereotypes of people from all race and expect them not to be serious and be funny instead.

Moesha was a show that had people THINK TWICE and realized that the issues of each episodes of Moesha is really sending people messages. Moesha was more than just a sitcom. Moesha was like The Cosby show.

All those who believe that the show Moesha should be DVD/VHS, be sure to sign the petition. Support this petition to get Moesha on DVD!!!

Much love and respect!! Moesha 4 ever!

Moesha,I Love this show!!,I still watch this show and enjoy it....I hope they come up with a new show
Moesha,Good show!,90s sitcom about a teenage girl name Moesha and her interactions with her family & friends. Moesha was self absorbed and toxic. Moesha & Q relationship was the highlight of the show. Season 5/6 seemed very rushed and incomplete.
Moesha,One of the best shows out there,"This started off brilliant, but recently, it has got so funny and so exciting. In the episode I was watching today Myles's girl friend thought she was pregnant from dancing and Moesha told Niecy that Q asked her to marry him.I just cannot wait till the next episode This show deserves a 100%, it is that good I would so recomend it to anyone who asked"
Moesha,90's Classic,Comentario no disponible
Moesha,MOESHA: Teen Sitcom & Family Drama,"MOESHA (1996-2001) starring the gorgeous and iconic Brandy Norwood, was a really great family sitcom drama. This series is a bit light hearted, and definitely started off stronger than it ended. (Grrr, that cliffhanger!) But it was a lovable and memorable show nonetheless.

""A teenager struggles to come to terms with everything life throws at her.""

Overall, this series was a really good show, a youth centered coming-of-age, family drama, about a black, African-American teen in the mid 90's. Among other great, diverse sitcom dramas of the time (Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Sister Sister, Family Matters etc.) Moesha really added to the mix.

Brandy was exceptional as always, clever, funny and gorgeous as well. Why aren't there more shows like this? Wholesome diverse, family shows? A really good show!"
Moesha,Great lessons but a not so great ending,Comentario no disponible
Moesha,Moelicious,"This was a great show if you get a chance to watch it do I first saw it because I was board instantly I loved it the show a great cast a great theme song it handled some tough issues as well. The ""Parkers"" (a spin off series) is kind of flat and over done but make sure to tune in"
Moesha,A suggestion,"I think Moesha was a very good and educational program. I think that the show dealt with many issues of the world today including relationships, drugs,violence,school etc. I enjoy every episode especially the ones where Moesha and Hakeem finally hooked up. I thought the show got better with each season. I like the cast and each one has a good acting resume. I also liked the fact that Brandy starred in a show in which it dealt with things and issues that she was probably already going through. I watched the show when it first came on until the day it was cancelled. I enjoyed every episode and i think it should be released on DVD for all the moesha fans out there."
Mind Game,Story that never ends,"And I thought the avant-garde style of animation and story telling was going to take its routinely long hiatus with the marvelous Triplets of Belleville, but I was fortunately wrong.

After reading countless reviews, certain people proclaimed their dislike for this film with little to no elaboration given, which somewhat intrigued me and pushed me further toward wanting to experience Mind Game. As an avid follower of experimental cinema and anime I rarely get rewarded with solidly evolving features, but once in a while I strike gold and get to travel through the medium of rich expressionism dealing with both real life and fictional events in the utmost fascinating fashion. Mind Game is the recent treasure and a great example of such artistry, fusing stories of love, self worth and other qualities of life, without forcing conclusions or values, but merely giving you a chance to reflect on your life or simply enjoy that of the characters.

The main conflict of this film deals with a young man named Nishi, who lacks courage to do what he really wants in life. After a rather fatal turn of events he gets a second chance at life and love. So he embarks on a journey to face things he otherwise wouldn't, but his personal rediscovery takes place in the weirdest of places.

Aside from feeling a genuinely exalting rush with its almost mosaic imagery and perfectly fitting music, I felt something else while viewing Mind Game and I attained a certain notion afterwards, which I don't see worth sharing, since I believe everyone who'll give this a watch will acquire on their own terms, levels and depth."
Mind Game,A very interesting experience,"I think 'Mind Game' is one of those movies that you either really like or really hate, but never in the middle. I spent first 20 minutes itching to turn it off since the animation style didn't seem all that pleasant, but then things just kept happening and before I knew it I was really immersed in it.

'Mind Game' has everything: irony, action, humour , even romance; and it touches practically every aspect of human life, going from relationships to domestic problems. All that covered in psychedelic imagery leaves a great impression.

You might experience various emotions watching this movie but one thing for sure, you won't feel like you've wasted your time when it's over."
Mind Game,Unbelievable...I loved it!,"I had to give this a 9 out of 10 for a couple of reasons: 1.) This is a truly original movie 2.) With a little patience the animation is greatly rewarding 3.) It's a rare movie about the enthusiasm of life without force-feeding it into the viewer's face.

I liked this movie mostly for reason number two and next because of reason number three. The animation is one of the real driving elements behind the film and if you enjoyed stuff like American Pop or Fire & Ice from Ralph Bashki, then you're also (more than likely) enjoy the animation and wacky celebratory art-style, rotoscoping, cel-shading, 3D and a bunch of other animation techniques used in this film.

Now, the real meat and potatoes lies within this movie's message for appreciating life, as it goes in the movie: the story never ends, just like life goes on even after the curtain drops for the main character (being you).

Unlike most films that force-feed viewers a ""hero"" who must save the day, get the girl and redeem himself, Mind Game instead wants viewers to root for the hero because the hero is put into a position where only he can root for himself. I also liked that this movie gives a flipside on what it is to appreciate life, even when you have nothing to look forward to in life. I think it helped turn this sometimes violent and dark film into something inspirational and hopeful. I also truly enjoyed the ""possibilities"" this movie played with that life can sometimes throw our way.

All in all, I loved this film. It's not a typical Japanese anime by a long-shot and it's certainly not for everyone (especially younger viewers) but it's a great film that any avant garde film enthusiast would greatly appreciate."
Mind Game,"A mind-blowing, surreal, life-changing adventure","Wow. What can I say? I was truly blown away by this movie. Winner of the Noburo Ofuji award (the most prestigious award in Japan for an animated film), this film has unfortunately only had a very limited release in Japan (although it is playing in theaters again since winning the award). The director, Masaaki Yuasa, has previously done critically acclaimed animation work on other series, and helped create the equally mind-blowing, and somewhat disturbing short animated movie ""Cat Soup"".

The first thing about the movie to note is the animation. The animators worked in a collaborative effort, and included a wide range of experimental and traditional animation techniques, a bit of CGI, and even a bit of live action. Viewed as individual pieces, it can be jarring, but seen together as a whole, each piece seems to fit with each other perfectly, with the different animation forms setting the mood perfectly.

The story begins in present-day Tokyo, and follows a loser who is letting his childhood girlfriend slip away. Things take a twist to the fantastical side, as the characters embark on a surreal journey that changes everything about them. The actual elements of the plot are not really the focus of the movie..it is about setting the mood, creating the atmosphere of the characters' emotions, and drawing the viewer in to same mental journey the characters are going on, without even realizing it. The pace of the movie picks up and slows in parts, before building up to its thunderous and (literally) exhausting climax.

See this movie , if only for the virtuoso animation that you will not see in any other film. And who knows? it just might change your whole outlook on life."
Mind Game,Touching the limits of imagination,"I saw this piece on local Animefest and I tell you what. I honestly thought my head will blow. Such seemingly never-ending torrent of originality and imagination is truly unprecedented. There are numerous animation techniques mixed together, loads of standard anime exaggeration (no manga though), psychedelic trips, serious issues and silly sarcastic humor. There's no way an intelligent non-shallow adult would not like this masterpiece. Consider yourself as unprepared for what you will see but be ready to be surprised when you do and mentally exhausted once you did.

By the way, describing the plot of Mind Game would be utterly stupid. It's a mind game alright, you will get the message one way or another.

Straight 10/10"
Mind Game,If ever there was a GEM...,"I am frankly appalled to see a total of 5 comments for a movie which, and I believe most people will agree, is deserving of much, much more attention and inspection. This film is like a light at the end of a long, boring tunnel that is the general doldrum of cookie cutter animated films released year round.

At once unique, inspired, beautiful, hilarious, weird, touching, unforgettable, innovative among other words that won't do it justice: Mind Game is the definition of a GEM.

The only other movie that I can think of in the same ""category"" is Waking Life, another animated excursion worthy of your time and attention. But even if you hated Waking Life, Mind Game is so different you might love it. Mind Game sort of takes Waking Life's ""all over the place"" style (cartoony one moment, then rotoscoped the next) then adds a story and characters and a LOT of humor.

Seriously, you owe it to yourself to seek this one out. My new agenda will be to show this to as many people as I possibly can. Help spread the word: Mind Game is cool."
Mind Game,MIND GAME redefines the animated film,"This film is beyond anything that has been made to date, both in Japan and the U.S. It is not a conventional narrative, yet the narrative clips along like a kayaker on speed. It seesaws from tight-tension drama to dreamy atmospheric visualscapes to video-game style song and dance routines! The overall plot is unimportant yet is completely engaging and satisfying. The characters come across as real people, and the shifts in perspective and personality heighten our understanding of each character as they face their ordeals. We get a sense of time both passing and standing still- which is the true mark of a genius of film: The ability to wrap us up in his concept of time and carry us along breathlessly.

If you like shiny robots, plots about strange bio-computer viruses that mutate people into shiny robots, and silly relationship dramas about high school kids with strange powers, please avoid this film. If, however, you appreciate innovative stream-of-consciousness film-making, fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants pacing, and so-sloppy-its-tight design, get yourself this DVD!!!! (Fans of FLCL take note!) Its hard to find in the U.S. right now (July 17th 2005) but it is poised to explode.

An additional note of interest is the fact that Matthew Minami is the voice of the old man- Jiisan. (You may remember him from the clips of him interviewing Bill Murray on Matthew's Best Hit TV that were featured in Lost in Translation...)"
Mind Game,Probably the most underrated animation in Japanese cinema.,"This movie is to a human mind what solving a really complex formula is to a physicist: an eureka! What I mean by this is this movie has all the elements of a life changing experience. You go expecting another entertaining dime-a-dozen type of film but you come out bewildered instead. Okay sure maybe this is a bit of an overstatement but it deserves some overstating since it only gets a poor review of not even 8 stars here on IMDb. I decided to give it a full 10.

I am not going to spoil the experience for you and I will just to sum it up in a few short words. This is the story of a loser named Nishi who bumps into his old flame while she's being chased by some bad guys. They eventually end up the girl's family restaurant where bad guys show up things go horribly wrong and everything changes for everyone.

I found the little snippets in between the story to be most valuable rather than the story itself. Although you need to follow the story closely to understand the snippets. Is is the little things that count. This movie is a lesson. Maybe some sort of don't do what I did type of lesson I don't know. But whatever it is I feel is the only drug you can take visually.

Enjoy."

Mind Game,"In this game, there are no rules","""This is one surreal mess!"" says one character in the film and, yessir, how right she is as weird doesn't even begin to describe the highly experimental anime ""Mind Game,"" Maasaki Yuasa's adaptation of Robin Nishi's manga. It's simultaneously an assault to the senses (Oh, what bright colors! Oh what loud drum rolls!) and an assault to logic (What the hell did they just do?) though it's not to say it's not a hilariously entertaining trip.

The film's narrative -- if you can even call it that -- involves the struggling comic artist Nishi (voiced by Koji Imada) who has just met his childhood girlfriend Myon (Sayaka Maeda) and they catch things up in her father's yakitori pub where they come face to face with two Yakuza members. Nishi gets killed in the process but in a highly bizarre encounter with God in the afterlife, he is brought to life, manages to kill both gangsters, and makes a run for it with Myon and her sister Yan (Seiko Takuma) as they are pursued by other gang members. The three are then swallowed whole by a giant whale. Trapped inside with a man who has spent the last 30 years inside the whale's belly, Nishi, Myon and Yan finally get a chance what true happiness means for them.

A Dali painting by way of a French New Wave film, the wildly unpredictable head trip of the aptly titled ""Mind Game"" beguiles all logical conventions, presented in dumbfounding temporal edits, inebriating close-up transitions, and varying degrees of crude yet proficient artworks. Unsuspecting viewers are likely to be thrown off by Yuasa's helter-skelter bombast (an outlook substantiated by not a few walkouts from the film's screening) but with exactly the right frame of mind, notwithstanding a sometimes bloated feeling courtesy of the film clocking at a little over 100 minutes, this heckuva kaleidoscopic joyride should delight as it tramples all cinematic formalities and shows, should you decide to break the rules, how to do it with style."
Mind Game,"Mind Game is unique in animation, Japanese or otherwise","I just saw Mind Game on YouTube after AMID in Cartoon Brew recommended it and I've gotta tell you: You have not and most likely will never see anything like it again! Initially seeming to be a tale about Nishi and his unrequited crush on Myon since childhood, this anime goes in all kaleidoscopic directions that leaves you breathless all the while. If you're tired of all the mostly cookie-cutter CGI features that have bombarded features for the past few years, and want something more unique in Japanese animation, Mind Game fits the bill perfectly! All the animation techniques that have ever existed seem to come into play here and the music score will take you on the wildest trip possible! So on that note, seek Mind Game on YouTube or wherever you can find it."

Mind Game,Nothing But Crazy And Experimental Visuals,"I have to say that I find it quite odd that I've watched two films in a row that both made me feel, for the most part, neutral. What makes it more odd is that the films are pretty much polar opposites. 'The Martian' is a conventional sci-fi blockbuster by a famous director. 'Mind Game' is a zany and surreal anime film that you can't even get on DVD in most countries (I had to watch it on Netflix).

The plot revolves around a pathetic loser named Nishi who gains a thirst for life after being killed by a Yakuza hit-man, meeting God and returning to Earth to exact revenge. After killing the gang member, he runs off with a car full of drugs, accompanied by the girl he is fixated with and her sister, and gets into a car chase with the rest of the Yakuza. This chase culminates with the trio driving off a bridge and being swallowed by a whale. Inside the whale, they meet an old man who has been living there for thirty years. The film then shows them becoming accustomed to life inside the whale before trying to escape, which serves as the big climax.

The main thing that stands out about 'Mind Game' is its animation and visuals. The film is crammed full with colourful and experimental imagery. It frequently shifts art styles and animation techniques. This is a primarily 2D hand-drawn animated film but often uses CGI for 3D tracking shots impossible in 2D animation, highlighting certain fantasy sequences, or just looking weird and different. There are even certain shots that replace 2D characters' faces with stop motion animation using live actors. I would suggest looking up a trailer to gain a proper look at the film's style.

The animation is very well done and the visuals have had a good amount of thought put into them, but there isn't much else to the film. I would like to apologise in advance for all my future reviews in which I go into great length about how empty or how rich the characters felt. The characters are an important part in whether or not I am engaged with a film. The characters in this film are unremarkable. Besides from what I've already mentioned, the only thing about Nishi is his urge and determination to escape the whale. The three other main characters – the crush, her sister and the old man – are not that interesting either. The fact that I can't remember their names illustrates my point rather well.

The problem of forgettable characters is not helped by the fact that the surreal imagery feels meaningless. It doesn't do much for the film besides making it weird and different. Surrealism isn't necessarily bad. 'Eraserhead' had bizarre and twisted imagery but that, along with its slower pace, helped established an eerie and dreamlike atmosphere that helped draw me into the film. On top of that, the main plot of trying to escape is rooted in the ""you can do anything if you put your mind to it"" cliché common in anime. These two sensibilities clash and cause a very peculiar mix. A scene in which Nishi gives a pep talk about living life to the fullest and not giving up feels life out of a more generic anime.

There are two montages in the film that give information about the characters and their back stories. The shots in these sequences are only screen for a very short time, which means you need to be attentive. This is all well and good if you're interested in what's going on. Since I wasn't, however, I found myself losing focus and finding them (particularly the one at the end of the film) to drag on for too long.

This isn't a bad film. I didn't hate watching it. I just found it to be unremarkable. The visuals are definitely unique and memorable, the animation is impressive, and the story moves along at a quick enough pace to make up for my lack of engagement. It's just that there are a few failures that cause said lack of engagement. I would only recommended this film if you like crazy and experimental visuals. There isn't much more beyond that."
Mind Game,The story has never ended,"This movie is really what the title says it is. At first I thought the title was bad, since it didn't say anything about the film, but in the end I realized it does.

If you are looking for a normal story (you know, with a start, an end, a punchline) you are not going to find it in this anime. The animation is coarse, not like the classic Japanese animation, a bit like Tokyo Godfathers, but even more symbolic. So why is this film so great?

Because of the feeling. Plot and animation separately don't make this great, but together they do. The moral of it all is that you must live your life to the fullest and enjoy everything life throws at you, since it is all you have. No one else is going to live your life or enjoy what you have.

My thoughts are that this story is deeply personal to Robin Nishi and, even if a lot of the symbols in it can be singled out and understood, most of it you are left to guess. An argument for this is the torrent of animation sequences that don't make sense in the beginning of the movie, repeated at the end of the movie and suddenly making sense. I believe that is the greatest innovation of this anime.

Bottom line: this is an art film. This time I mean it in a good sense :). Perhaps because it has a positive view on live and it is more accessible. Anyway, if you are ready for its message and are in the mood for a fun carpe diem story, you gotta see this. If you've enjoyed Tokyo Godfathers, then you will also like this movie."
Mind Game,A true masterpiece,Comentario no disponible
Mind Game,A magical afternoon in Shibuya,"The start of the film is a bit rough,character behavior, but as it moves it along it just gets more amazing. I have seen many Japanese anime movies, Miyazaki being my favorite. Mind Games raises the bar visually, not beyond Miyazaki, but for anime in general. I am amazed that this film has not toured the U.S, by now. Anyone who loves anime must see this film. The use of color is extraordinary and seems to build into ever more wondrous neon kaleidoscope. the story itself is also very well constructed, full of compelling characters, some suspense and a great ending. Life in the whale is such a creative element. I'm now trying to find a DVD copy of this film for my collection. If you have a chance, be sure to see this amazing film."
Mind Game,A masterpiece of animation cinema that redefines the limits of imagination.,"This movie pulls so many things flawlessly off, I didnt think were possible. The Artstyle and animation are some of the best Ive seen in my life (actually there are several artstyles that are unified by the same style of animation). Unique, exagerated, stylized, fluent, energetic, vibrant. The editing is artistic, yet it lets you easily follow whats going on. The characters seem a bit one-dimensional at first, but gain depth when the movie slows down. Even the soundtrack and sound design is top notch. From poppy, slower songs to powerful and fast drum solos, from the breathing sounds to auditorial dramatisation of emotions.

Mind game is stupid and smart at the same time, flat and phyilosophical. It presents itself as peak-artsy, but in such an silly and innocent way that you simply have to love it.

This is a trippy, exagerated journey and introspection. One that not only teens and early 20s people might enjoy, but pretty much everyone who can handle crazy."
Mind Game,"An astonishing, refreshing viewing experience.","Knowing this was quite an unknown film around most parts, ( it barely got a release anywhere besides Australia and New Zealand outside of Japan, I think, correct me if I'm wrong) but, I must say after buying this Movie I did myself an incredible favor. It was a wonderful,heart pounding, utterly unnerving and hilarious movie that is a feast for the eyes and is an incredible viewing experience. The film uses astonishing and colorful visual techniques to tell its story, and it uses multiple forms of animation throughout its running time. Its an incredibly imaginative and unique narrative, the film jumps from one scenario to the next however the film makers, unbelievably were able to maintain a coherent and easy to understand story thats well told and fleshed out very well.The only minor flaw is that some parts of the film maybe a bit wacky and out there for some of the more sensitive viewers out there,but, Overall, see this film, by any means necessary, don't miss out on this one of a kind experience!"
Mind Game,Cool but long and tiring at times,"LIve your life to the fullest. Create it, grab and take it. Otherwise cool visuals but also a bit tiring..."
Mind Game,A great journey into the meaning of life,"I saw this movie at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival ""www.bifff.org"" in March 2006

This movie is a real kick in the face, a ballet of music, feelings and poetic vision of life. Something between David Lynch and The Yellow Submarine of the Beattles.

The hero is falling into desperation and will meet god for a little interview.

Please take that ride ! You will not regret it. This movie is full of pleasure and humor and you will probably cry or laugh ...

Thanks BB"
Mind Game,Animated drugs,"Watching this movie is an unique experience. A celebration of life with an explosive climax final. However, in my opinion it needs some more depth and creativeness to become a classic masterpiece."
Mind Game,One of the most enjoyable experiences in anime,"Absolutely unconventional and totally unforgettable. I was only lucky enough to hear about this film in a YouTube countdown of top adult anime films and I was immediately captivated by its unique style of animation; a brilliant mix of anime and film. After searching the web and watching it in less than executable quality, i found a true gem of a film. With its intriguing stylizations of expression that go as far as obscuring the lines of life and death, reality and fantasy, love and hate... a real treat is in store for audiences (17 years and older). Do not expect anything that might mirror the pristine outlines of Studio Ghibli's masterworks. Instead, discover that there are many other unforgettable masterpieces in the world of anime films. Mind Games is a film that all anime fans MUST see before they die. Jot this one on your bucket list."

Creeped Out,Cute and creepy,Fun little show. Kinda like black mirror meets goosebumps
Creeped Out,Fun for young and old,"A surprisingly fun Twilight Zone-esque anthology show aimed at kids. This doesn't mean that adults can't enjoy this as well. The stories have enough ""meat on the bones"" to keep things interesting at all times. A not too scary show for the whole family. Definitely give it a watch."
Creeped Out,Black Mirror Lite,"The acting is decent, the different settings are fun and the stories are interesting. This is great if you're looking to binge an anthology series. Majority of the episodes are entertaining and range from spooky to sci-fi and it keeps the series engaging. The show has fun with the concept and is worth checking out if like you shows that don't take themselves too seriously."
Creeped Out,Twilight Zone for teenagers,"Some people here are comparing this show with ""Black Mirror"". Wrong. The inspiration for this show is Twilight Zone (Google it!).

A obvious clue is given in the episode ""Shed no fear"", where you can see ""Serling"" in a billboard right next to the pool. Rod Serling was Twilight Zone's creator and main writer.

I'm a huge fan of Twilight Zone and I'm an adult. This show is made for teenagers, but the tone and the script are interesting and entertaining. Who likes mistery and supernatural will enjoy."
Creeped Out,Middle school black mirror,"If you wanna watch something ""creepy"" with your kids and teach them some morals - this is the show for you."
Creeped Out,Fun and Engaging,"This series reminds me a lot of Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark with moral centers reminiscent of Asop's Fables . Each episode is based around some sort of damaged moral, such as bullying or theft, and spins a tale around what could happen if the wrongs aren't put right. Changing every episode, some feel more horror orientated whilst others definitely lean towards fantasy or science fiction. I feel like this is a Creepypasta for kids anthology, a lot of fun to watch and sort out where the stories are leading. Acting isn't top notch, definitely more like Goosebumps in that effect, but it's not intolerable and since the plots were so engaging I didn't care one bit. I highly suggest this to those prone to the weird and eerie stories you might hear around a campfire."
Creeped Out,Refreshing and pleasantly surprised,"This is my very first IMDB review. I have read many a review over the years but never have I been moved enough to get an account and rate. I felt compelled to review this series b/c this show does not deserve anything less than an 8 collective rating.

I felt compelled because of how incredibly impressed I am with the originality and execution. One episode after another after another continued to amaze me. Another reviewer said it's Goosebumps meets Black Mirror. For some episodes I agree, but not all episodes make a commentary on tech. The ones that do are done well btw.

A more accurate description of this series is Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark? meets The Outer Limits and Twilight Zone. There's another kid-focused horror series on Netflix ""Two Sentence Horror Stories"", but that series is GARBAGE. The acting and execution on that show were consistently disappointing and I couldn't get past 2 or 3 episodes.

NOT THE CASE WITH ""CREEPED OUT."" So easy to binge watch. So many novel twists and unexpected endings. I was skeptical at first because I wondered how entertained and ""scared"" I would be by some kid show. One word - VERY. Some of these eps are DARK. I even got nervous after I woke up mid of the night b/c the images from one of the episodes were flashing through my mind and had me on edge as I attempted to delve back into slumber.

What's cool about this show is that it also provides moral warnings for questionable behavior without being preachy. Stuff like, don't press all the elevator buttons you obnoxious child or else this might happen to you. Or don't take your parents for granted.

I am so happy to have found this show. I was invested in the characters, the plot, and the outcomes. So many times I found myself saying ""Come on kid! Seriously?! Don't make THAT choice."" For a series to repeatedly accomplish this level of investment in 24 min of runtime is to be feverishly commended.

I also appreciate the diverse international cast and locations.

My favorite episodes in order and why:

From Season 1: Trolled - eerie conclusion I absolutely love The Traveler - love the delivery of the ep's lesson Bravery Badge - love their take on zombies Shed No Fear - warmed my heart the message of friendship and family

Season 2: I actually liked every episode from this season so this was hard to pick. However...

One More Minute - cliffhanger, and devastating when you think about the ramification of the main character's actions

No Filter - Eerie AF!!! The ending had me like ""Jesus...after all that!""

The Many Place - love the ending and how it turned out to be not what I originally thought. I thought it was going to be about a haunted hotel and it wasn't!

Help - love the character arcs and the use of tech. That little girl! I appreciated how my feelings towards her shifted drastically within 25 min.

Honorable Mentions:

Itchy - I found the main characters wildly annoying but I put this on my list bc I've never seen a story that features lice in this way. LICE!

The Takedown - surprise ending and love the lesson around greed and the take on be careful what you wish for.

Kindlesticks (season 1) - different take on babysitter scary stories theme. I did not see the ending coming. I actually played it back so I could wrap my mind around what just happened.

In sum, I LOVE THIS SHOW. Big time hats off to the writers for putting in serious thought into each episode."
Creeped Out,Uneven but still good,"You need rhink that these are stories purpose is not to creep you out everyone said this was aimed at teenagers-kids.If you are expecting a Saw series you are at the wrong show.

I even find it kinda funny how people say it is a ripoff of Black Mirror when there is only 2 episodes revolving around the bad use of teconology.The other episodes when there is a sci-fi element it won't revolve around the bad use of it so people who are rating this low thanks to that don't understand a teen show and that is kind of sad.

But if this is not a sci fi show what are you going to get?

Well think of this show as a modern Aesop's Fables and you get what is supposed to mean,there are stories that instead of animals use Sci-Fi/Horror/Fantasy elements to tell stories that you are supposed to get a meaning of it instead of a fox you will get a cheater instead of a dolphin you will get a mermaid.

And do they work for that?Yeah some stories are quite predictable as you expect what will happen but when this show is as it's best it can really be a good way to tell a good story even the best of the stories could have their own separate movies just for how good they are. There is a lot of filler stories that aren't exactly bad but quite predictable even if they are mostly a good way to do these some of these stories have good ideas but terrible execution but for the most part this is a good show.

The best thing i can come up with is that these stories can be good ways to teach actually good lessons to be a good person,even if these lessons are basic for what it is it works.

My Personal Top 5 Episodes 1-A Boy called Red 2-Kindlesticks 3-Cat Food 4/5-Side Show Part 1/2"
Creeped Out,Teen Twilight Zone,This series is very good. Lessons learned the hard way. I enjoyed this a lot even tho I grew up with the older TZ. Clever stories to make your teens think. Great job to all creators of this series and the actors.
Creeped Out,"The spritual successor of 90's adolescent scary story shows ie. Goosebumps, are you afraid of the Dark.",Comentario no disponible
Creeped Out,Tries too hard to be Black Mirror,"The show tries too hard to be like a more...I guess kid-friendly? Black Mirror. The acting is painful at its worst...laughable at best. The ideas aren't anything we've not seen in Black Mirror before.

Technology can be dangerous when we absue it, you don't know what you have until you lose it, your actions can have brutal consequences."
Creeped Out,Perfect for parent/child,"I watch this with my 9 year old son. He loves it and I actually like it quite a bit. It is toned down enough for kids, but plenty interesting for adults."
Creeped Out,Some Interesting Stories,"The stories aren't terrible, though they're mostly remakes and mixes of old tales, but the whole The Curious thing at the beginning and end of each episode is dumb and annoying and makes me want to stop watching."
Creeped Out,Not scary at all,"I thought I would watch a horror series but it is so silly you want to laugh instead.

The acting is really poor, it looks like they're all amateurs actors.

The only thing nice about it is the message behind each episode, but the series still doesn't worth your precious time."
Creeped Out,For people who don't understand or troll,Here's the deal it's not trying to be scary it's trying to tech morels and thing that happen to people irl. Let's say like one of the episodes is trying to say be careful what you wish for and anther episode is saying be carful what you post online
Creeped Out,It is Black Mirror for Kids,"Good series, creepy like they say. It reminds me of Black Mirror from Netflix."
Creeped Out,A Hit-Or-Miss Show,"""Creeped Out"" is an anthology show with spooky episodes and of course the show will remind you of ""Goosebumps"". In the show you will find episodes that are actually really good . . . but unfortunately there are episodes that either aren't the greatest or just plain bad. All in all in my opinion the episodes range from a 6 to an 8."
Creeped Out,Watch with your Family!,"I liked most of the episodes because each episode end was unpredictable. each episode bring a message and a surprising end (specially the last episode). it wont be black mirror (funny - how people can compare that), but its entertaining. Watch with your wife and kid, you wont regret."
Creeped Out,Twilight Zone...,...for the children of Millennials. Set the stage with your kids by watching the Twilight Zone New Year's Day Marathon on AMC.
Creeped Out,Great serie for young and old,This reminds me of are you afraid of the dark and goosebumps I really wish there where more seasons After watching all episodes i wanted more Sadley there was only 1 season as far as i know off
Creeped Out,fun,"I like most of the episodes, it's like a family version of Black Mirror. But seriously why male parents are always freaking useless? Don't do any preparation crazy busy morning preparation and or taking care if their OWN kids and babies, and just play guitar? Taking about all of the stuff like they have nothing to do with them. What century i'm living in? I can't even imagine how easy i'd be to live as a male being."
Creeped Out,Horror for children,Stared good. In middle of season some episodes were too childish. Reminded me of my childhood when I used to watch so called horror movies but were actually for children.
Creeped Out,"like ""Black Mirror"" for kids.","I'm a parent of a 10 and 8 year old girls and my 8 year old loves this show. It's like Black Mirror but for kids. Totally PG. in fact it's rated Y-7 but it's still has a creepy feel to it for kids w out any disturbing stuff or gore. Good stories too. I think it's good they created something like this for those children who are drawn to more ""creepy"" stories w out getting traumatized lol"
Creeped Out,Undecided,The narrator's voice at the beginning and end of EVERY EPISODE is quite irritating and not needed but the stories are decent.
Creeped Out,Not just for kids,Great level of spookiness and clever nods to cinematic treasures

Stretch Armstrong: The Breakout,"Classic Superhero Themed Animation with better animation quality. Great world building, many representations of POC but weak villains","Its very reminiscence of early 2000s superhero themed cartoons on tv. This animation reminded me of the Amazing Spiderman in terms of tone setup and characterisation, meanwhile the world building reminded me of very Superman and Teen Titans - ish. Plus the movements and the powerset itself almost identical to Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic 4. Everything revolves around a material known as Flexarium which in its active base form can cause mutation to anyone contacted with it. Apparently its a very powerful material in this universe that very reminiscene of how spiderman got his power.

It is kinda interesting to split the very same superpower attribute which was the flexibility into 3 different categories - 1) stretch - Jake, 2) expand/change size/mass - Ricardo and morph/flattens - Nathan. Few more interesting characters and many representation of POC and LGBTQ+ community.

The quality of the animation was good, great 2d animation with classic superhero sound tracks and scores that reminded me of superhero cartoon thag i grow up watching. Voice castings were alright and definitely liking the world building aspect of this animation. Nothing special in terms of the storyline, just a generic superhero plotting. Not a fan of the villains from this universe. Recommended."
Stretch Armstrong: The Breakout,"Like the 90s, only better.","In 1996 we got a Flash Gordon cartoon where Flash and most of the cast were teens who rode hover boards. In 1993 we got Mighty Max that was based on a toy that was the male gendered version of Polly Pocket. In 1997 we got the Extreme Ghostbusters. These were all cartoons that had disqualifying tropes mandated by corporations with faulty market research. But despite these tropes that make you say no before seeing your first second of animation, the people making the cartoons turned out highly entertaining cartoons. (I watched Flash Gordon and Mighty Max new but didn't see Extreme Ghostbusters until I bought season 1 on DVD from Australia.)

Hasbro hit big with G.I. Joe and Transformers because writers at Marvel created endearing/enduring characters out of Hasbro's toy mess. But as a general rule Hasbro doesn't understand this and thinks they can make hits with every toy line.

Forgetting all of this, when I tried the first episode of this cartoon based on a so/so Kenner toy from my childhood that I knew a couple people who had one, involving teens, I didn't get very far in before deciding this wasn't for me.

But when season 2 launched I saw Wil Wheaton and others talking about their show with love and reverence on Twitter in a way I had not really seen before. So I decided to give it another try.

This is definitely a show, like Flash Gordon, Mighty Max and Extreme Ghostbusters, that rewards you for watching, the farther in you get. Unlike shows of the 70's, 80's and 90's, you don't get a strong sense from the show that some parents group is mandating content rules. There are some stories where bad decisions lead to consequences, but most of the episodes advance the overall storyline.

The cast is great, does a great job, and is filled with well known names. The theme song is catchy. The show is an all around good time."
Stretch Armstrong: The Breakout,A superhero series with a 1980s feel,"I'm not keen on superhero films, so this isn't the most interesting, but it drew me in. The first season involves the three protagonists, Ricardo, Jake, and Nathan testing out their powers as the Flex Fighters. One of the major themes is a corporation named Rook Unlimited which is gaining power in the city itself, even gaining control of public services, privatizing them. This is not shown in a positive light as Rook is pretty incapable without the Flex Fighters. Apart from that, there is occasional romance, like a crush of Ricardo on another girl, with the same for Jake, a sub-story. The second season parallels the skepticism of government in Gatchaman Crowds or in Macross Frontier where the government is shown as incompetent and easily corruptible. This series has no LGBTQ characters, although it is great due to its criticism of scientific hubris, propaganda, control, the media, and the dangers of technology dependence. The fact that few can figure out the real identities of the Flex Fighters is almost as absurd as the fact that only a small group of Adora's friends knew she was She-Ra in the 1980s series, She-Ra: Princess of Power. It's an annoying cliche. This is a bit broken apart as more people find out about it as the series moves forward. I enjoyed the action, the characters, and the plot of this show, making it more appealing than I would have thought. That's why I would give this show its current rating."
Stretch Armstrong: The Breakout,Underrated Superheroes,An amazing show about superheroes and just as you think what is going to happen a huge plot twist happens. I also found similarities to the spider verse throughout the show making me more into it

The Protector,Not as bad as its reputation would suggest.,"In the second attempt to introduce martial arts superstar Jackie Chan to the North American market (after ""The Big Brawl"" in 1980), ever likable Jackie is amusingly miscast as Billy Wong, an NYC cop who, after some hot dog heroics, is demoted to crowd control at a fashion show, where he's partnered with Danny Garoni (the engaging Danny Aiello). Unfortunately, they prove to be pretty useless and Laura Shapiro (Saun Ellis), daughter of a wealthy big shot, is kidnapped by goons working for dastardly Hong Kong mobster Mr. Ko (Roy Chiao). Billy and Danny manage to convince their commissioner to let them travel to HK to advise and assist local authorities in defeating Ko and rescuing Laura, but of course these two mavericks are pretty much just going to do whatever they want to do.

There are *some* fine moments here for Chan fans, but there simply may not be enough. The tone *is* rather gritty, but although there's not a lot of outright comedy, the movie does still have a sense of humour. Chan has some fine action and fight sequences, especially one around the halfway point where he's trying to pursue a henchman escaping by boat. The stunts near the end are impressively scary. Writer / director James Glickenhaus (""The Exterminator"") does a very fine job in utilizing the various HK locations. Jackie does his best in the lead, with Aiello offering fine support and Chiao being just right as our glowering bad guy. Jackie does have a decent if not spectacular climactic fight with fellow martial artist Bill Wallace. All things considered, it's not hard to see why Chan himself and some of his fan base might not care for the movie, but there is an alternate cut now available on Blu-ray with additional scenes created by Jackie himself, to better suit his vision (he really had no control on this feature at the time).

In any event, it's worth noting the presence of a couple of familiar faces among the supporting cast, including Becky Ann Baker, John Spencer, Mike Starr, Big John Studd, and Trey Wilson.

It would take another 11 years before North America finally, really took notice of Jackie with the release of ""Rumble in the Bronx"".

The Protector,Gets A Bad Rap.,"This movie is a lot better than people say it is. Sure, it's not a typical Jackie Chan movie, but it's good anyway. It has lots of action and is better than most of the buddy cop movies of the 1980's. Don't expect this to be like all of his other movies and you may like it. I did."
The Protector,unfairly bashed just because it was not a typical role for Jackie,"Everybody and their mothers bashed this movie including Jackie himself who reshot and added more action and fight scenes in Hong Kong. I think Jackie bashed the movie himself because it was a flop.

This was an above average 80's action cop-buddy movie with some very expensive action scenes. In NY harbor they blew up 2 boats and in HK they blew up a helicopter. The fights were good to excellent including a Jackie fight with legendary MMA fighter Bill Wallace and a crazy fight in a massage parlor and that is just off the top of my head. Probably my favorite scene is the fight and chase scene in Kowloon harbor on the water itself where a population of boat people live year round. He does 2 death defying stunts in that scene alone, one involving a motor-cross bike and one with a long pole.

It was not a typical Jackie flick because Jackie curses a lot and is seemed to be a cocky womanizer and there is a lot of nudity in this movie and it wasn't a comedy. His acting wasn't bad and i thought his chemistry with Danny Aiello was pretty good too.

Personally, i am a huge fan of Jackies being that i think i saw just about all his movies including some bad ones went he was just starting out in the early 70's and as a fan i'm glad he switched to a new role in this movie...and i don't know but there is just something about this movie that makes me watch it again and again. People ripped the endsong and i thought there was nothing wrong and it was a good song.

It doesn't hurt that the gorgeous Moon Lee is in the movie too! All in all this is probably in my higher selection of Jackie movies that i like. When and if you do watch this movie, know that this is not a typical Jackie movie and just start from there and i hope you will like this movie also."
The Protector,6 out of 10,"I DIDNT HATE IT! which really surprised me, because everyone on IMDb said this movie totally sucked and I went in expecting the worst. Sure Jackie is miscast, but other than the addition of curse words, his character isnt any darker than in Crime Story or Police Story 2. The action is slow, but better than any of the American action junk I've ever seen. Plus, there is tons of full-frontal nudity! Bet you didnt expect that from a Jackie Chan movie, did ya? I can understand why JC was disappointed with it, because it is nowhere near as good as almost any of his other 80's-90's movies, but it aint all that bad. Go in thinking you will hate it, and you just might like it."
The Protector,"Chan may not like it, but I do","(57%) Back in the mid 80's Mr Chan didn't much care for this movie as he felt it was made not fully utilising his talent, for which I can understand. Featured here there's none of his trademark comedic fights, or insanely dangerous stunts, instead we get a gritter, more typically 1980's R-rated American action flick with plenty of shoot-outs, fist fights and explosions. The level of strong language, along with quite a lot of nudity also sets this apart from the usual Chan flick, but I cannot say I didn't enjoy this. The action is solid with plenty of it, and for a medium budgeted 80's action flick this is better than average."
The Protector,Gets Better With Age,Comentario no disponible
The Protector,lifeless,"This movie suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no clue as to how to package Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except for his being the star. In his Hong Kong films Chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but ""The Protector"" is lifeless throughout. Danny Aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. Both have been better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and drab. It wouldn't be until the made-in-Canada ""Rumble in the Bronx"" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie."
The Protector,Dueling edits,"The perfect example of the difference between HK, and American action, this one exists in two forms: the James Glickenhaus pile of garbage, and the fairly entertaining Jackie re-edit with new subplot and fight scenes....I can't really recommend either, but the Chan edit, is well, obviously better, and it turns out the villains CAN fight.....Sad to compare the two really. I still get a rise out of seeing former pro-wrestler Big John Stud in an early scene as a robber....."
The Protector,I wish someone was protecting us from this film!,"THE PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You think, ""ah, it's a crappy Hong Kong movie."" Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it is crappy. This amazingly stupid Jackie Chan film, ruined by us, yes us, the Americans (I'm boiling with anger, ooh, I think I'll jump out that window!), has Chan as a New York cop hunting down a gang, avenging the death of his buddy. Sounds cool...but it's not. Don't waste your money renting it. To prove he could make a better cop film, Chan made the amazing POLICE STORY (1985)."
The Protector,Jackie Chan movie for people who don't like Jackie Chan movies,"This film generally gets bad reviews, mostly it seems from Jackie Chan fans. It is a more 'American' type of action film and if like me you do not like the usual lighthearted Chan films then you may well like this as it is a lot more serious.

Pleasantly surprised by this one, great action scenes. Pretty violent and very little or no slapstick comedy!!! Chan gives a fairly poor performance in this but then he not the best actor in the world anyway and it does not really matter. His fight scenes are very good, though not as elaborate as in his other films. This makes the whole thing more realistic, with more emphasis on bloody gunfights and explosions as is typical of James Glickenhaus' work.

Not bad at all. Enjoyable."
The Protector,One of Jackie's least memorable movies.,"Misguided Jackie Chan vehicle tries to shoehorn the star into a generic, typical action film of the eighties, saddling him with a complete a**hole of a partner, played by Danny Aiello in one of the less shining moments of his career. There are some good stunts and a couple of fight scenes, but they are nothing compared to some of the stuff Chan has done in his best work. (*1/2)"
The Protector,Criminally underrated Jackie Chan action - one of his best American movies,Comentario no disponible
The Protector,Oh I Do Like This One!!!,"I love any JC movie where he is not acting like comedic idiot. Some of his slapstick humour is very good but it gets a little monotonous after a while.

The Protector is a great example of how good a straight, serious JC can be.

Great 80's action :)"
The Protector,Can do much better.,"After constantly reading and hearing nothing but negative opinions about the American produced, but also filmed in Hong Kong Jackie Chan vehicle 'The Protector'. It didn't sway me from checking it out. I'm no Jackie Chan fan, but honestly it was director James Glickenhaus' name which fed my interest. Best known for the 80s exploitative vigilante flick 'The Exterminator (1980)' and some entertaining action joints 'The Soldier (1982)' and 'Shakedown (1985). 'The Protector' does have the same vibe of his early efforts; gritty, brutal, rough and seamy. And I would call it lesser work. However the main talking point will always be how Glickenhaus used Jackie Chan. Yes, Chan is wasted in a role that would've been better suited for someone else (Norris comes to mind, as it has more in common with his stuff), as his martial arts abilities and amusing characteristics are never truly capitalized on. I'm so use to seeing him with that *wink, wink* attitude (Project A) and piling on those extravagantly energy-packed stunt work (Police Story). It's a different kettle, and very atypical. Here he looks uncomfortable throughout with that hardboiled edge. Just listen to his sober delivery of the dialogues. That endearing personality is kept in check. This performance seemed to ask more on dramatic acting, than his psychical and lively talent. He's pairing up with Danny Aiello (a loutish cop) couldn't be anymore disjointed and unbelievable. The chemistry never felt right, but with these problems I still was mesmerized. The rest of the performances (Bill Wallace, Roy Chiao) were indifferent. Look out for a short appearance by Mike Starr. While it didn't have the on-going rush I was expecting, Chan gets some furious and hard-hitting action sequences (like the opening slow-motion bloody shoot-out, tricky boat chase (one by water and the other by foot) and a marvellous sky-high balancing act). The film doesn't start off too badly, but when it hits Honk Kong. The copy and paste formula with its many predictable outcomes (involving the seedy crime underworld and the buddy style of two rogue cops) seems to plod along rather coldly. At least there's something enticing about the moody Hong Kong scenery, and ace cinematographer Mark Irwin's crisp moving camera-work is expansively fleshed-out. Effectively detailing the backdrop. Glickenhaus' direction is scratchy, but he knows how to set-up street style locations and infuse sleaze (especially the opportunities that arose to squeeze in nudity). It cops a lot shtick, but without the expectations it's a passable odd of sorts."
The Protector,Ruined by dumb American executives,"Jackie Chan had no control of this movie (at least the American version). The director somehow thought that Jackie would come across better to audiences as a Dirty Harry cop! Didn't he realize that Chan is popular because of his stunts and kung-fu action? Apparently not, because in an interview years later, the director said he didn't regret his decision and kept claiming that Americans wouldn't accept Chan's Asian style.

Back in Hong Kong, Chan re-shot the movie extensively, adding car chases and kung fu action. He also edited out a lot of the American director's idiotic stuff. That version is supposed to be quite good. This American version? It's AWFUL! You'd never guess what Chan is capable of by just watching this movie. The action scenes here are *dull*. Yes, *dull*.

By the way, Chan next did POLICE STORY, as a ""take that!"" to that American director (James Glickenhaus, who hasn't done much lately. Hmm...wonder why....). See that movie instead of this!"
The Protector,7/10 for Jackie Chan cut of film (HK ver.); 5/10 for American cut,"Having watched the American version, I was just thinking of how boring it is. Someone commented that Jackie Chan should not have starred in it, as it gives the wrong expectation. I don't think that is it. This movie would have been just as poor with another actor. The problems are story (which is generic and un-original), under-development of villains, Jackie Chan has almost nothing to do in the film, as his talents are not utilized, no memorable characters, pointless nudity and too much casual swearing. The firefights are terrible, the tone of film is very brown and film is poorly shot by its' original crew. Having watched the American Blu-Ray version, I never wanted to re-watch the film and even after finding out about the HK version, I put away watching it for about a year. However, based on another review recommending the HK version, I decided to watch it. Wow, it turned out a much better movie! Jackie Chan was in charge of re-cutting the film, from what I understand. The changes are drastic: Pointless swearing is gone, nudity removed, some parts of the story were re-written and scenes changed order, some additional scenes were shot to accommodate new story, some comedy inserted to make movie less boring and the final fight sequence has been created and shot to give villains a satisfying ending. Basically, the Jackie Chan cut is similar to other 80's Jackie Chan films, still not as good as his classics like Police Store, etc, but overall, there is just no comparison to the original American cut. So, if you've never watched this film, I only suggest watching the Jackie Chan cut. If you have no access to it, don't bother watching the American film, as even if you didn't know who Jackie Chan was, you would not have enjoyed this terribly-boring cut."
The Protector,Violent cop actioner with Jackie Chan,"The Protector is an oddball among movies starring Jackie Chan. It's directed by James Glickenhaus who seems to be some kind of cult favorite among fans of violent b-movies. (I've seen McBain and The Exterminator so far, and even if those aren't very good films I do get why the director's edgy and cheesy style has following.) So if you are expecting kung-fu comedy, you might be disappointed. But if you like 80s action films in the Cannon school of entertainment then you are in for a ride.

There is shooting, fighting, explosions, and everything you'd want from an over the top 80s actioner. The plot is quite basic but the quality of the action makes it worth seeing at least once."
The Protector,Average cop/buddy movie with a mediocre storyline! 3/10,"Review: This is yet another mediocre movie from Chan, who tries to crack the US with this English movie. Chan plays a New York cop called Billy Wong and after his partner is gunned down during a robbery, he's teamed up with Danny Garoni, (Danny Aiello) against his wishes. Whilst at a lavish function, a rich man's daughter gets kidnapped and when they piece together the clues, they find out that the father has connections with a drug kingpin in Hong Kong, so they head there to crack the case. It doesn't take long before the kingpin hears that they are in town, so he sends out his hit men to try and take them out. After various battles with the baddies, Billy & Danny come face to face with the kingpin and with the help of an ex-soldier, they use heavy artillery and Chans Kung Fu skills to get back the girl. To be honest, it seemed like many films that I have seen before in this genre. Chan didn't really use his Kung Fu skills that much but it was good to see him actually act, without any silly comedic scenes. There are a couple stunts that were OK but they were not in the same league as Chans movies that he made in his native country. With that aside, it's a watchable film with a decent storyline and I liked the chemistry between Aiello and Chan. It won't go down as a classic but it's one to add to the Chan collection. Average!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by James Glickenhaus who only directed 8 movies in his short career, which included Timemaster, McBain, the Exterminator, the Astrologer, the Soldier, Shakedown and Slaughter of the Innocents starring Scott Glenn. You can tell that Chan was restricted with the amount of death defying stunts that he was allowed to do because of the laws in American movies. That's why his career in the US didn't last that long, because he got fed up with being told what to do. You have to hand it to him for trying to make a movie in English and I honestly don't think that it was that bad but it does look really dated for this day and age, which is why I didn't give it a high score.

I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/drama/martial arts movies starring Jackie Chan, Danny Aiello, Sandy Alexander and Victor Arnold. 3/10"
The Protector,a different style of Jeckie chan,"I liked the realistic character of the film, because you know he really did what he did and it was not effects."
The Protector,A different role,"After Jackie Chan's partner get gunned down in a robbery, he gets paired up with Danny Aiello, a cop with a very different style. They're both at an elite fashion party when the daughter of a tycoon gets kidnapped, and they get assigned to solving the case and bringing her back. From New York to Hong Kong, the pair find themselves in some very dangerous situations (and have to tackle some tough stunts along the way). I kept thinking it was very cute to see Danny in an action movie, since his son started his own career as a stuntman in the early 1980s.

It's a bit of a shock to see Jackie Chan in such a tough-guy role. He may be a police officer, but he holds no qualms about shooting bad guys in the neck; he even uses the f-word! If you'd rather see him in the sweet, Shanghai Noon type of roles, skip this one and stick with his usual comedic image. This movie is a gritty drama, with tons of violence, drug lords, exploited naked women, and back-stabs around every corner. It wasn't my favorite, but I did appreciate the different genre.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."
The Protector,You will be protected from boredom!,"Jackie goes Hollywood, next attempt, but here in darker B realms. Just Glickenhauser. The film is correspondingly tough and unusually humourless, which is rare in the Chan oeuvre.

Jackie didn't like it, but most fans, even those of rough 80s cop films in general, should be quite satisfied.

Aiello is as good as ever and also lets JC shine a little more, the buddy cop team harmonises perfectly. After a look at dirty New York, we are allowed to go ""home"" to colourful Hong Kong. It starts off entertainingly, then has a brief hiccup, but the finale has its reverberations thanks to some spectacular scenes. All in all, a good film, even (or perhaps especially) in the non-Jackie version, so the sometimes poor ratings are surprising. Note also the henchman of evil, Bill Wallace. An absolute martial arts specialist, unfortunately too rarely immortalised on the big screen, especially in higher quality."
The Protector,not as good as The Big Brawl AKA Battle Creek Brawl,"i didn't mind this movie pairing Jackie Chan and Danny Aiello.it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination,but it kills some time.i've always liked Danny Aiello,so he elevates the movie a notch for me.the movie itself is a pretty generic crime drama.it's much darker in tone than The Big Brawl,Chan's first American movie,which had some humour in it.this one really doesn't.i didn't think the dialogue was all that great in this movie either.some of the lines were unnecessary or just plain silly.still,the movie was entertaining enough.this is Chan's second American movie(Cannonball Run II was just a small role,so it doesn't count)for me,The Protector is a 5/10"
The Protector,Chan's the man in a great action set piece flick,"This is one of those really unjustly criticized movies, I've vide'd a few times. It too has a great soundtrack at it's end, by Chip Taylor. This is another action spectacular flick from Glickenhaus, who knows how to make bigger than life action movies. The Protector has a lot of qualities about it, and in spite of Chan's real hate for this film, this is one I'd rather opt to watch, than his other chop suey comic style ones. The action sequences in this film that really get us exhausted, watching Jackie, especially in the last one, are fantastically shot. After being suspended for not playing by the rules when avenging his partner, (in the first great action piece, my favorite involving a speedboat chase) Chan's New York cop, Billy Wong is demoted to crowd control for a high fashion show. Here the beautiful daughter of the company is kidnapped and it's up to Chan and likable sidekick (Aiello) to retrieve her, which leads em' to Hong Kong for business and a bit of dangerous if near fatal pleasure, involving some sexy, young, and deadly masseurs, where another great action piece evolves. This movie is heavy on action. It has almost everything, even a drug lab, full of totally nude Asian women. This is a bit of a cheeky action movie, as how it lets a bit of female anatomy seep through, one thing I strongly admire about it, and Chan barely has time to stop and rest, fighting baddies, and impressing us with some of his stunts. The movie too has an interesting, unrelated start, involving thugs stripping a truck, and making of with off the Texan's guy's computers. Aiello and Chan make an interesting team, in a interesting choice of casting. They work well off each other, and though this film isn't at the top of Jackie's hit parade, The Protector is an action movie that delivers on all levels too with a bit of guilty cheek and humor. Don't be put off with the bad reviews, please. Watch for Mike Starr as Thug 2 in the first action sequence."
The Protector,The protector,"Billy Wong is a New York City cop whose partner is gunned down during a robbery. Billy and his new partner, Danny Garoni, are working security at a fashion show when a wealthy man's daughter, Laura Shapiro, is kidnapped. The Federal authorities suspect that Laura's father is involved with Mr. Ko, a Hong Kong drug kingpin, so the NYC police commissioner sends the two cops to Hong Kong to investigate. Once in Hong Kong, the pair causes no end of trouble for both Mr. Ko and the local authorities.

Jackie Chan refreshingly goes ""Dirty Harry"" mode (mean and moody) in this standard cop thriller that has more stunts than fights ( the Hong Kong version has fights incorporated), and as expected, there are some hair-raising stunts such as the helicopter and boat sequence in the beginning, but most impressive one is when Jackie uses a bike, a pole to get closer to a boat. There's some good fights ( a good one with Superfoot Wallace), but mainly gunfights. There's more gore, swearing and nudity, something you usually don't find in a Jackie Chan film. The nudity is unnecessary, is there for mere titillation and comes across tacky. The tortured man with twigs sticking out of him is quite lurid. Also, Jackie's partner (Danny Aiello) is very annoying with his constant swearing and talking. Still, it's a watchable film, though not on par with the Police Story series Jackie shortly after."
The Protector,"Mediocre Action, Underutilized Star.","A weak film from top to bottom. The Protector stars Jackie Chan as the lead in a story about a New York City cop and his partner looking to take down a drug kingpin from Hong Kong. Jackie Chan is obviously the only reason why anyone would be interested in seeing this film but he's completely miscast and underutilized. The main character is written as a gruff, no nonsense type that completely clashes with Chan's style of lighthearted, comedic characters. To be fair, Chan has done well with serious material in other films, but the script here is so hollow that he's only allowed to be one note and ultimately dull.

Then of course there's the issue with the martial arts sequences. The whole appeal of a Jackie Chan movie after all. Sadly, Chan had no say in the staging of any of the fight scenes and was outright denied to work on said scenes by the director. The result is martial arts sequences sloppily directed with little to no flow or energy.

But even if you take Jackie Chan completely out of the conversation, The Protector still doesn't work. The performances are dull, the script is generic, the score is awful, and the non fighting action scenes are awkwardly edited.

If you can, see the Hong Kong cut of the film. It has much better editing, improved choreography, and some added weighty material compared to the US cut.

Regardless, this is one of the weakest films Jackie Chan has ever been in."
The Sinner,Disturbing first season,"Couple of things: Jessica Biel never ages. Pullman can pull off weird disturbed detective well. This is a series that will keep you guessing till the end- very unusual, very dark and very disturbed. You won't feel good about yourself at the end in the nicest possible way. Very addictive and I loved the soundtrack too! Check it out."
The Sinner,I LOVED The First Two Seasons,"But the third season is horribly terrible or terribly horrible take your pick.. First off, the story was boring and it didn't hold my interest and it seemed forced.. Secondly, I think the actors who played Jamie and Nick were terrible choices because I just didn't care about the characters they played like I did in the first two seasons because they were so much easier to connect with which made me care about what they were going through.. I've read that there's going to be a fourth season and even though I didn't care much for season three I will watch it because Bill Pullman is fantastic as det. Harry Ambrose.."
The Sinner,I feel like this show is going down,"Jessica Biel was the perfect choice, the first season is amazing. I loved it. The second was enjoyable as well. However I felt like there's a hole, somehow could've been better. And the third season is okay. Not more. I wouldn't rewatch it. Shame. I was really excited about it."
The Sinner,Give it a go and you will be stuck before you know,Comentario no disponible
The Sinner,Outstanding,"I don't do many reviews on here. Usually only if something is extraordinary or horrible. This show had me on the edge of my seat the whole season from start to finish! Jessica biel has always been a good actress, but her performance in this blew me away! Hope she does more dramas like this in the future.. she's a natural."
The Sinner,A Promising Why-dunit,"Cora (Jessica Biel) is a normal looking young woman who commits a shocking crime in full view of many witnesses. As viewers, we witness the crime also, so there is no doubt of her guilt.

Means and opportunity are never in question, but what is the motive? That is the central mystery around which this series revolves. And it is the question that drives police detective Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) to dig deeper despite Cora's confession of guilt.

Ambrose is a sad sack character who seems to commune better with nature than with people. Perhaps he understands compulsion and seeks to unravel his own while investigating Cora's.

In the first episode, Cora says, ""I never thought that I would have a normal life."" This is a major clue that her behavior may be rooted in her early years. Throughout the show, there are flashbacks to various happenings from all periods of Cora's life--clues that form pieces of the jigsaw puzzle solution.

As for the acting, most of the heavy hauling involves Biel and Pullman, who are convincing. The tone of the show is moody, suggesting the turmoil that lies just beneath the surface.

It remains to be seen if the writing can weave a tale that keeps the story interesting over the course of the 8-episode season. This is a good start.

Update 8/25/17: After four episodes, I am raising my grade to ""8"". The story is riveting. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes a good police mystery."
The Sinner,Loved seasons 1 and 2 - season 3 was such a disappointment - what happened?,"I watched seasons 1 & 2 in a matter of days. I loved the show and thought it was a great treasure. I was so excited when season 3 came out. I don't know if there are new writers or what changed, but this season was just simply unbearable to watch.

I ended up having it on to finish the story but literally looked for household chores to do during the episodes as that was more exciting. So disappointed. I hope if there is a season 4 it gets back on track."
The Sinner,When seemingly normal people do brutal things,"""The Sinner"" is (so far) a three-part series asking what drives people to commit murder. Each story is 8 parts.

The first one stars Jessica Biel as a married woman, mother of one, who goes to the beach one day and stabs someone to death nearby. A police detective, Harry Ambrose (Bill Pullman) becomes interested in the case and works to find out what happened.

The episode will have you on the edge of your seat, as there is one surprise after another, leading to its shocking conclusion.

The second series concerns a young boy who, while he is in a motel with his parents, poisons them. Again, Harry Ambrose becomes involved, determined to find out the boy's motivation. Though this series of episodes isn't quite as good as the previous, it's still terrific and again, will really have you guessing.

Then we come to the third series. Every review you will read will tell you to skip it. Just one problem. No one who says ""skip it"" happens to mention that it stars the gorgeous Matt Bomer. I wouldn't have cared if he read the phone book for the entire episode, I would have watched it.

However, it is absurd. A real let-down from the previous stories.

I am not sure if Bill Pullman is good or not. He plays a pretty wacky guy and basically has one expression, kind of a half-smile, throughout all of the episodes. Frankly I found his personal life somewhat of an intrusion, as those details were unneeded.

Highly recommended, one of the best things I've seen, with the exception of the third story. But, hey, it stars Matt Bomer."
The Sinner,Decreasing quality,"Season 1. Great

Season 2. Average

Season 3. Garbage."
The Sinner,Please make a third season,"One of the best series I've seen, both seasons. Excellent thrillers. Great role for Bill Pullman"
The Sinner,Seasons 1 and 2 are great. Season 3 not so much.,Comentario no disponible
The Sinner,On the edge of my seat...,"I have never noticed Jessica Biel's acting as anything other than sub-par, but I am blown away at how great she is in this roll! You can tell she's hiding something or has blocked her past out for one reason or another. Every episode ends with a cliffhanger! I am on episode 7 of the 8 and I have no idea what's going to happen next! The unpredictability of this show and the characters. I am just as confused with Bill Pullman's character and the why he feels inclined to help or figure out why Cora did what she did. I can't wait till next Wednesday! I love a good show that I can't figure out the ending!"
The Sinner,Entertaining,"I give the first season an A, but I give the second season a C. Both were entertaining, but the first season was way better in my opinion."
The Sinner,Season 3 ruins everything,Season one & two were brilliant! however season 3 was the biggest let down with the most ridiculous story line ever. I kept thinking each episode would get better but to no avail.
The Sinner,Season 3 is ludicrous,"""Harry"" keeps doing idiotic things. It's distracting. And Pullman's mannerisms have become far too exaggerated. This newest season feels like a mimic of NBC's ""Hannibal.""

I like the previous two runs.

But THIS one? In each episode, Harry just screws up. I realize, obviously, that the plot is intentional. But it's impossible to become ""invested"" with a character who acts illogically at almost every turn.

And it's not just Harry. I just keep thinking to myself, ""Hey, that person would NEVER do that!"" And I'm not discussing ""Jamie,"" who is unbalanced."
The Sinner,Amazing from season 1-3,"We loved season 1 and 2, and loved season 3 as well! I'm not sure why people didn't like it but it was just as amazing as the others! Season 3 was like an iceberg, you feel you were give all the facts to begin with but with each episode you dive deeper into the darkness! I also loved that each season is so different! Maybe that's why people disliked season 3 because they wanted more of the same, but I loved the different approach to all 3 seasons because it makes you excited to start each story! Love love loved it!!"
The Sinner,Criminally underrated,This is become one of my all-time favorite anthologies and streaming series ever and I rank it right up there with the likes of Breaking Bad The Sopranos everything else although it's impossible to compare any of these truly because they're so distinct and that also describes the sinner. Each episode focuses on the main character a detective who who seems to walk a fine line between the real and the Paranormal and always seems to be attracted to the most difficult cases and the most interesting ones like opposite charges attracting one another. There are so many themes and sub themes to this series especially including the concepts of religion life death suicide this is just an amazing series and I can't even begin to write a proper review without spending a lot of time but please give it a try.
The Sinner,"Definitely a solid, slow-burn show","This show, ""The Sinner"" is certainly a slow-burn show. It won't appeal to everyone; and the episodes do move slowly, but with purpose - to build a greater sense of tension and curiosity in the viewer. It's a little extra-sexual in parts, (and I agree with the comment on Ambrose, I feel like his sexual preferences/habits aren't really central to the plot of the show) but for the most part, this too is purposeful...Cora (Jessica Biel) was obviously abused and extremely oppressed as a kid, so she's had less freedom to find herself than the average (30 -something?) woman.

Out of ""Somewhere Between"", this show, and ""Midnight, TX"", this is the one I find myself coming back to. It's dark, moody, you KNOW something's just not right but what is it???

Start watching, and keep watching, to find out."
The Sinner,Engaging cerebral slow burn detective thriller,"Bill Pullman's Ambrose is a fascinating character, deftly fleshed out and envisioned in this series of unique crime mysteries. Season 4 is particularly good. Watch and relish as you follow Ambrose on the hunt for truth and Justice in a small New England fishing town. Excellent performances all round supporting Pullman."
The Sinner,1st two seasons excellent..3rd is BORING!!!,"First 2 seasons are definitely worthwhile but the 3rd took a BIG nosedive.... We actually stopped watching because it was so painfully SLOW..... There's some sort of ""big reveal"" which they keep milkin' episode after episode... Got sick of waiting!!"
The Sinner,Season 1 outstanding season 2 good dont bother with 3,The first 2 seasons were really good but what on earth happened with season 3 its rubbish and boring
The Sinner,Disappointing 3rd,Season 1 Brilliant. Season 2 Not Bad. Season 3 Waste of time. Watch something else.
The Sinner,Season 2,"It's funny.

Many people seem to have an issue with the second series. ""It's too slow. Nothing happens. The team does not know where to go.""

For me, these negative reviews tell me more about the reviewers than about the series. So what if a series is slow? Don't you have any patience? Do you really want artificial action and GoT tension in every minute of every episode? Have you ever read a book???

Yes! The series starts of slow with the viewer seemingly knowing everything there is to know. And then it slowly unwinds, throwing us of balance every time we think we know what is - and was - going on.

Some actors do a great job, some do a bit less than that. Just like in any other series or movie. That is just the way it is.

The viewer has to want to watch the series. What the hell is wrong with that?"
The Sinner,Worth watching but could be a lot shorter,"Given what the story is, eight episodes is overkill. I think they intentionally set the number of episodes, and then stretched out the content to fit. There are a number of cycles repeated in the show that is mostly rehashing things already shown. There are also a number of side things that don't really advance the plot. Still, it's certainly not bad and for something to just watch casually it's fine. It's nice mystery drama, and is quite detailed in terms of settings and events."
The Sinner,season 3,This season is so bad it's almost unwatchable. Bill Pullman has one expression the whole time. He's ineffectual and gets himself into the stupidest situations. Matt Bomer has one look too. It's the wide eyed look of someone who's just sat on glass. There's no one to like in this season. No one to root for. Hated it.

The Baker and the Beauty,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,"I watched this series on the ABC network and completely fell in love with it. I was so disappointed that ABC cancelled the show without a Season 2. It is now streaming on Netflix and I am enjoying watching it over and over again. It is a wonderful love story of a mega star and a baker combined with a beautiful family relationship and a little bit of comedy. It felt so good to finally see a series with virtually no violence, no profanity and tastefully done romance. All of the actors are wonderful and the chemistry they have with one another is quickly noticeable. I am hoping that the series does so well that Netflix will provide a Season 2."
The Baker and the Beauty,Why did ABC cancel this show?!!!,I am so mad that ABC cancelled this show. I just binged this whole season and I am furious that this show is over!!! I WANT A SEASON 2!!!!!!
The Baker and the Beauty,Not bad,"I've watched the original Israeli version and enjoyed it alot. I liked how they took time for each of the character's story to unfold. Whereas the US version seems a tad bit rushed, especially the sister's character. I am not giving up on this just yet as I do see potential. Only time will tell."
The Baker and the Beauty,Good Feelings,"This show is super cliche, but good feeling. It elicited emotions akin to those from watching Hart of Dixie, but with a Latinx cast reminiscent of Jane the Virgin. This really should've been renewed!!! Not all shows have to be super suspenseful or deep, sometimes we just need scratch the surface feel good shows and this scratched that itch. The characters are all likable, however Mari (the mom) is my favorite! Fun fact: Lisa Vidal can now be found on Gray's Anatomy. She's an awesome actress and needs more spot light!"
The Baker and the Beauty,"Overall good, the original is way superior","This is a remake of the Israeli series ""Lehiyot Ita"" which I binged on several years ago. The present version is pleasant. The story is fun, the actors are nice, the soundtrack is wonderful. Very fitting for a weekend afternoon watch. What I'm unfortunately missing is the intensity and hilariousness of the original characters. The performances here seem to be more subtle, less dramatic and somewhat more ordinary. But they are likable regardless. So, the show's nice, but I think watching ""Lehiyot Ita"" with subtitles is several times better."
The Baker and the Beauty,Just finished season 1 then got to know it's got cancelled,"First shame on you ABC for cancelling this great show. This show had every element that you would want from a rom-com show. Great characters, good storyline. So it's disappointing, but the way they finished season 1 I will be okay if this show failed to find a new home."
The Baker and the Beauty,Israel did it better,"Ok. But the original Israeli version, which can be seen on Amazon Prime,vis much better."
The Baker and the Beauty,Just what we need...,"...During a pandemic. It's sweet, positive and quite clever. Shows are so trashy and filled with manipulative twists and over the top story lines. This is just an OG, sweet rom com. And who doesn't need that in your life? Covid or not?

Praying there is a Season 2! 🙏"

The Baker and the Beauty,They baker sucks,"The male character, the baker is not sympathetic at all. He doesn't listen to his family all of whom are telling him his girl is expecting a proposal. Then he gets soup all over himself when he says no. Why is he the main character? Why is he supposed to be sympathetic? He is not, he sucks. I couldn't even get through the first episode it is so fake and stupid.

The Baker and the Beauty,Breath of fresh air!,"I just saw the advertisement for this show the day before it premiered. It is a really fun, cute and comedic show. I think my 15 year old daughter can actually watch it with me. Minus the threesome comment episode one. No language that I caught so far which is great! You can make a great show without all the crap in it. Actors are good hoping this is a keeper series!"
The Baker and the Beauty,Representation Matters!,Finally a show that represents the LatinX community as a strong family with great values. How fantastic to watch two parents raising three strong children. The show really resonated with me. It gave me such hope and optimism. A feel good show with great relationships. What a journey.

The Baker and the Beauty,Too bad they didn't use REAL Cubanos and play REAL Cuban Music - Gente de Zona etc...,"This show is a nice light change from the problems that are in our world now. I enjoy this show. I like that people strive to be nice and pleasant in this film. Family and friends are important in this show.

It's just sad with all the talented Cubans living in the US, a Cuban wasn't used in this film. Also, the background music could improve with it actually being Cubano. -Gente de Zona, Charanga Habanera. Old music from Celia Cruz...etc.. just to name a few."
The Baker and the Beauty,Amazing show!,"It is a great show to show to binge on a friday night from like 7pm-3am. The show covers funny aspects needed in a show, comedy, drama and romance. I'm just sad there will never be a season 2. I think that the show is great and could be carried on for more seasons."

The Baker and the Beauty,Unexpectedly very good,"Wow! This show seemed like on the outside a very cookie cutter rom com tv show that was going to be similar to other shows. But this one was refreshing funny and great acting. I love all the characters and look forward to seeing them develop. The lines aren't cheesy and I love the Afro Cuban music played throughout the episodes. I had to Shazam quite a few they had me dancing in the living room. I got through half the season in one night. That's how good it was. It had me laughing and put me in a good mood. I love this show! I'm glad they didn't make the main female lead snobby and superficial, would have been hard to like. Keep up the good work!"

It is refreshing, witty, sexy and heartwarming all at the same time. It's an excellent representation of a Latino family that we call all relate to. I truly hope we'll be able to see more of this ensemble cast who I believe the best cast ever!

It's got high marks on Rotten Tomatoes, The petition for renewal garnered over 155,000 signatures.

Why not a Season 2!!"

Borgen - Power & Glory,Is Borgen convincing?,"I'm a big fan of the series, but it probably helps that I'm the only British politician (I was an MP for 13 years) who grew up in Denmark. To complement rather than repeat the other reviews, a few words on how realistic it is.

The multi-party negotiations are entirely plausible - that's how Danish politics works, and there are parties that switch allies from time to time. The balance between idealism and scheming is also really well done - most British and American movies and TV series portray all politicians as ruthless power-mongers, but generally politicians like to think they're doing the right thing, just like anyone else. The character are recognisable types - in particular, the far-right leader is clearly modelled on Mogens Glistrup, the entertaining, folksy and erratic founder of the current Progress Party.

The series is maybe a bit weaker on the big political issues, since it has to tackle something complex in an hour, and an issue like Afghanistan can't really be analysed in any depth in that time. The episode on a thinly-veiled Sudan with the smooth, corrupt Northern leader and the plausible Southern leader with some uncomfortable views is gripping but stereotyped. But it works brilliantly with smaller issues, especially those that interweave with the private lives of the protagonists. Above all, it creates sympathetic yet flawed political figures with a non-political private life, so much more like real politicians than the one-dimensional figures that the media try to make us."

Borgen - Power & Glory,Most likely the best political television series ever made...,"It is just impossible for me to find the words to describe this Danish television series. It gives an incredible in-depth (and probably honest) view of politics, one you have never experienced before. After watching the first season of this show, one is already deeply impressed by the acting and the story line. Guess what: season two even beats season one. The private life of prime minister Birgitte Nyborg gets a more important part. Young actress Freja Riemann is magnificent as her daughter Laura. Also the other actors are of extremely high standards. To mention a few: of course there are Sidse Babett Knudsen (as Birgitte Nyborg), Johan Philip Asbæk (as Kasper Juul) and Birgitte Hjort Sørensen (as Katrine Fønsmark) in the leading roles, but smaller roles - showing great acting - are played by Ole Thestrup (as right wing politician Svend Åge Saltum) and Peter Mygind (as the chief of the tabloid - low quality - newspaper Ekspress). Television can not get much better than this. I'll be looking forward to the third season as I've never been looking forward to any television series' next season before. This series is an absolute must- see!"
Borgen - Power & Glory,"Well sketched characters, excellent direction, topping pace.","I am not one to watch lengthy part series - not at all!! This one just grabbed me and held me tight. The Danes and Sweedish do quality TV, especially in casting and character direction. Compared to many US productions, where characters are often like cardboard cut-outs, this series gave us believable real live human people. Brilliant photography and beautiful direction.

The story too was very well crafted, looking deep into human behaviour, morals and ethics in power, and the consequences of actions taken.

It is a series I will watch again in the future, if just to enjoy the rich texture.

I highly commend the production team and recommend this excellent series."
Borgen - Power & Glory,Masterpiece,"I have rarely felt such complete commitment to a series. The acting is outstanding. The mix between media and the heart of politics is so cleverly well done it covers drama with reality at a top level. Every single actor in this series deserves high acclaim. The skill from the writers and producers is at gold medal level. A powerful intelligent full package in entertainment, drama and real life."
Borgen - Power & Glory,"Incredibly gripping, totally addictive, a TV series of absolute genius",Comentario no disponible
Borgen - Power & Glory,Intense- Classy- Great Dialogue and Acting,"We all know a great TV show when we see one and this one is a great one. I am so tired of American drama that seems to all be written by one crew and all has one plot of killing a person then trying to figure out who did it. Borgen has gripping dramatic plots that is accentuated by great acting. The acting is intense and spectacular, and you have to see it to believe it. The dialogue is well written and the scenes are addictive and gripping. And no commercials or loud sickening music that is needed to keep the audience watching most of the cheesy American TV series. All the characters have there own personalities and show a sense of individualism that is so very refreshing."
Borgen - Power & Glory,One of the best shows I've ever seen,"I've always liked Danish cinema: the properly written stories, the superb acting and the well developed turns which yet do not seem unbelievable. Having been curios whether the quality I got used to can be attainable in a television show I decided to give Borgen a chance. Now I wish I didn't : I unfortunately became addicted. :) Since others wrote so many things about the first 20 episodes I wish just to continue focusing on the last 10.

I have to admit that I was really afraid of watching the third season. Having read unfavorable opinions I just did not want to spoil the satisfaction which I felt on finishing the second one. But seemingly against all odds I got deeply impressed again. Surely, politics and real world problems occupy sometimes a too big stake with questions getting debated on at a speed one can not easily follow, but the characters remained likable, flesh and blood, and the screenplay do not let them down. Sidse Babett Knudsen's performance is impeccable as always and Brigitte's way towards inventing herself again in politics as well as in personal life provides enough fuel for the story. I can imagine that Danish viewers find some detail exaggerated or too shallow, the presented relations or roles too embellished compared to the reality and the style on some places preaching but I just live in a country where the quality of the politics and the media is extremely low, the people vested with high positions can hardly be revered and the decisions made on governmental level are too often arbitrary. It was therefore interesting to see that there are places where this sector can be approached without any chance of laughter coming from the other side."
Borgen - Power & Glory,It cannot get better than this?,"I have so enjoyed ""The Wire"", ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Killing"" to name a few, that I absolutely had to post this, my first review. Borgen is totally absorbing.

The human characterisation is immense and is simply the best (in my opinion) series, film, broadcast I have ever seen. Thank goodness for subtitles!

It is a fascinating insight into how government works in a democratic society and how it ""maybe"" deals with so many issues that affect us all. If you hate politics and politicians, this series will temper your feelings. My scepticism and my cynicism towards government will not be as entrenched as it has been having seen this production.

Superb acting by all the cast. Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant!"
Borgen - Power & Glory,Fantastic Political Drama,"Borgen is a Danish political drama, similar to House of Cards, and may be the best political show I have seen! The show focuses not only on politics, but on the lives of those involved in it, including their families, and their personal struggles.I just got through binge watching seasons 1-3 in about a week, and just heard the news that a fourth season will be coming in 2022!"
Borgen - Power & Glory,Political dynamite,Comentario no disponible
Borgen - Power & Glory,Borgen - brilliant,"Borgen is a superb TV series, topical issues, political intrigue, terrific actors. The political shifts are totally credible. The development of characters in this series is truly impressive. They're rounded out, they have real depth. This is true not only of the central characters but the more minor ones too. The relationship between the media and high office is also convincingly portrayed. The way in which personal lives are impacted - particularly of course that of the Prime Minister's - has real emotional charge. BUT - and this is so important!: what on earth happened to the person responsible for sub-titles in English in Series 2? This is absolutely appalling,almost impossible to follow the story line without the subtitles. How did this go out without anyone spotting it? A really shocking flaw in so marvellous a production."
Borgen - Power & Glory,RISES ABOVE THE STORIES.,"Some cheap plotting, saved by superb casting, acting, videography, editing, music. Overall, the best recent TV series, but that isn't saying much, is it? Third season, weakest. African episode, way over the top; also, Jeremy and Brigit in Hong Kong (silly)."
Borgen - Power & Glory,Tiring and discouraging,"Politically the show is ridiculous. Throughout the episodes the prime minister role regresses as a person and shows a disappointing character. Everything she does is to stay in power. The mix between journalism and romance of two characters is caricatured and worthy of rotten scenes. In addition to being cynical, the PM's character is a liar and a model of a mother who shouldn't even exist in fiction. The screenwriter of the ridiculous peace negotiation should become a consultant in the negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians due to his skill and speed in resolving conflicts. It doesn't take 30 episodes to show the rot of the political world. It is tiring and discouraging."
Borgen - Power & Glory,"Surprising Find, A Definite Masterpiece","I didn't watch the West Wings (Sorkin's style annoys me), so understandably I feel equally lukewarm towards the ADHD fast-talk-fest of Newsroom. I can't stand House of Card's format with Spacey talking at the audience. I find Veep funny but repetitious. All of which my wonky other half watch with glee. I watch Scandal, yes, but Scandal is not a pure political drama, but a fast-paced raunchy fashion show soap opera with spin-doctoring toppings. So basically, a political drama has to be really exceptional to keep me.

Borgen, is close to being a PERFECT work of its genre, AND as a dramatic piece of work. All the right ingredients - the casting, the framing, the setting-up, the tension, the exposition of complicated back stories, the pacing, the editing, the continuity, the humanity, the suspense, the humor, the angst... Sleek, non-preachy, lots of culturally-specific yet totally relate-able pains and joy, just the right depth, just the right amount, to keep the interest, to surprise one later on. Lots of reference to US political history, edu-taining snippets of where Denmark is in the scheme of European politics. But also enough heart-breaking yet un-sentimentalized domestic drama and complicated yet un-cheesy romantic entanglement to allow for intimate connection with the key characters. My only complaint is (I'm only at 2nd season start) the obviously alpha-female leading lady is emotionally too wimpy when dealing with matters of the heart, and the improbability of a head of state of a rich nation having no government-paid nanny or private tutor for her kids.

But overall, delivery and the cast performance is as sleek and smooth as the spin doctoring in the story, qualities this genre calls for.

I just heard American TV (HBO?) is looking into adaptation. But of course. I hope this adaptation will be as good and 'true' as my current most favorite US TV show, another adaptation - of the Swedish work, The Killing. What's with these Scandinavians. They write exceptionally effective TV shows. Congrats, anyhow, the Danes.

Highly recommended, for the political/ legal/ media drama sort. Totally worth the extra step of reading English subtitles."
Borgen - Power & Glory,"Intense, realistic, versatile... And not about politics and media only","In many countries, this century has seen dozens of political dramas where ""dry"" politics does not prevail, it is rather a background/motive/reason to picture human relations and their changes proceeding from changes in circumstances. Borgen is a fine Danish example of respective matters, without the simplified approach ""bad politicians - good journalists"", and that even famous people at high places are humans and personalities, with their ups and downs, feelings and sexual life. Of course, Denmark is more ""open"" here than many other countries and only a few positions are separated from ""ordinary"" people by security guards, but still... Apart from sharp and logical script, there are diversified performances, beginning with Sidse Babett Knudsen as the protagonist Birgitte Nyborg Christensen up to less frequent appearances by not less famous actors such as Lars Brygmann, Jens Albinus, Lars Mikkelsen - to name a few...

True, there are some trivial elements available almost in all Scandinavian crime series (e.g. Child molestation) and there are several similarities with Adam Price's previous creation Anna Pihl, but nevertheless, Borgen is a series that could be mandatory for both viewers and politicians, particularly ahead of any elections. Because not is all as it seems when power and fame come into question.

PS Season 3 is strong comeback, even ""green"" topics are depicted in a sensible, not annoying manner. And SBK steals the show everywhere, sometimes perhaps too much..."
Borgen - Power & Glory,Better than 'House of Cards',"The human side of politics and price of power. So well written, directed and acted. Yes, the subplots are not genius, but the show is outstanding as it shows how well-meaning, responsible people can be corrupted and consumed by power. Unbelievably well made!"
Borgen - Power & Glory,"A little slick, but still riveting","The international success of Danish political-crime thriller 'The Killing' perhaps played a major part in the UK screening of 'Borgen', a drama set entirely within the Danish parliament. And the two shows have something in common, in their relatively unhysterical portrayal of political life (and for U.K. viewers, an intriguing insight into how a political system might evolve when locked in a state of permanent minority or coalition government). I loved the wheeling and dealing in both series, but (aside from the lack of a killing alongside the politics in 'Borgen') there are differences. In short, Borgen, with its fantasy liberal prime minister, beautiful people, and stories wrapped up in self-contained episodes, is just a little bit slicker than 'The Killing' was; and I don't mean that as a compliment. But this is comparing it to a very high standard. There's still some good acting, some clever scripting, and a subtle portrayal of the increasing loneliness of life at the top: you can imagine that this is the way that government really is run (although perhaps the programme also tells us something about how the Danes would like to perceive themselves: 'The Thick of It' could not have been more different but also rang true, and I can't believe that Danish government is so utterly different from that in the UK). It's still riveting entertainment; and moreover, seems to have anticipated the actual outcome of the recent Danish election."
Borgen - Power & Glory,Danish Political Drama,"After watching the sixth episode of this series, I continue to be impressed with the political drama with its impact on family and personal relationships and excellent script. As a close political observer, I can totally sympathize with the prime minister whose personal integrity shines; however, she has to balance the policies of her left of centre party with the realities of government. No easy chore, given the nature of coalition politics that she must navigate. It is set in Denmark, but the uneasy alliance is typical of minority Parliaments we have seen in Canada as well as the standoffs in the United States between Presidents and Congress. Denmark is a nation committed to democracy so the conflicts and characters ring familiar but the drama is every bit as evident as The West Wing or Madam Secretary. The language transmits well with the captioning of the wit and repartee that is a strong part of the script. The prime minister's aide is a political spin artist who creates the talking points for every controversial decision. In the meantime, he is caught up in a serious relationship with one of the nation's leading television journalists, a sub-plot that is also fraught with personal pitfalls and the need for objectivity. The relationship of the prime minister with her family is very moving and the viewer realizes the sacrifices that are part of being a public figure and how family and public life are on a constant collision course. She manages her personal life very well, just as she manages the political fallout from being in a position of power. The prime minister has amazing wisdom and grace but one can imagine how gruelling the life can be. Her husband is as committed to her and her politics as any man could be. It takes a toll however. For example, having to sell his shares in a wind energy investment that is about to take a big jump on news that the government is on the verge of a major breakthrough. He and the Prime Minister are able to make the compromises necessary to ensure their marriage. When her father comes to visit, and lonely after a recent divorce, she is the one who has to let him know when it's time to leave. All in all, this classic television show highlights in a realistic and entertaining way the management of political and personal conflict and the daily drama of the people caught up in a life in politics."

Borgen - Power & Glory,High quality viewing experience,"I have seen series one (i.e. episodes 1-10).

This drama portrays the parallel developments in the formation of a new government in Denmark, and the activities of the major TV company TV1 where we see the newsroom. In each case there is a strong female lead seeking to balance the demands of ethics and principle, against the realities of their day-to-day working lives. There is also considerable coverage of how the demands of politics affects the home life of the first female prime minister.

The spin doctor character provides a direct link between these two worlds (as the PM's adviser, and as the ex-boyfriend of the journalist).

The writing was very sharp (perhaps particularly in the first half of the series). I don't think the political elements are as unrealistic as some seem to be claiming, but neither is it a documentary and clearly some aspects ring more true than others. The episode concerning Greenland I know had many people reaching for information about that topic.

Appointment viewing for the 5 weeks over which it was shown in the UK."

Borgen - Power & Glory,"Fictional political TV-show, which focus in the human aspects of the life of politicians","The show follows the newly elected Prime minister of Denmark Birgitte Nyborg and her Spin- doctor Kasper Juhl. While the first season was criticized for being a far cry away from any realistic depiction of politics, the second season have climbed to be a great story about the life of politicians in Denmark. While the drama is sometimes is exaggerated compared to that of real-life (which is to be expected) the stories are however quite believable as many of the themes are inspired by true stories and problems Denmark's politicians have faced during the last 20 years. While the characters went from stereo-types in season 1, many of them have grown into dynamic believable characters in the second installment. If one can survive the pretentious opening titles and the dumb-wise Machiavellian quotes, the sopping drama from time to time, especially in the first run, second season we offer a rich and engaging story which must be applaud for its eminent storytelling and drama which is both entertaining and relevant for anyone interested in politics. Also one should not forget that this is a drama, not a depiction of real politics in the traditional sense, but is much more focused on the human cost and complications of being a politician. Cliché? perhaps but it's still being well executed. A fine 7/10 is rightly awarded here."
Borgen - Power & Glory,Well written.. but ..,"This is a well written series but it fails to inspire. The story line takes a back seat to the sophomoric personal dramas that are front and center in every episode. Who cares about the "" friction "" between the characters?? The continuous and obviously concocted conspiracies make what could be a very good show into a pantomime. How it received such stellar reviews seems to be gender driven .. We all appreciate capable people and the fact that women are now being singled out just because they are women makes me cringe ... If you want to see strong women portrayed in roles of intelligence and strength then switch to Bordertown a much much better series."
Borgen - Power & Glory,danish political drama,"A couple of decades ago the expressions Danish political thriller and Swedish action movie were used to conceal adult entertainment. Borgen defies these old jokes by being an exquisite political drama.

If you've seen The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and felt that there should be more politics than crime, then you're in the right place. I understand that the same authors have been involved, but without further analysis, i'd say that the atmosphere is the same. Besides, you'll encounter some actors you've seen before.

Borgen follows the lives of ordinary people involved in politics and media and other visible and not-so-visible individuals that shape our society. We see how they change and how their careers influence those around them.

Given that Borgen comes from Danemark, which is among the best regulated countries countries in the world, it is interesting to see that there are some things that are universal. Namely, the politicians almost exclusively care about their career and the media are merely looking for a new story for their next edition."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Touched my heart so deeply!,"Terrace House is a reality show with a different flavor, but the core is the same, which is ""What derives human behavior?"". Some behavior is driven by desire to find love, some by desire to self-enhance, or find true purpose, etc.. So, every member joins in order to achieve something different, and you can't help but to relate to most of them in a thing or two or even the whole character. As a viewer, you also get to understand that there are no rules for attraction, be it romantic attraction or friendship. people just get attracted to each other in a complete random and unexpected way. Japanese men and women are classy, hard working, very honest and decent, and fun also. My favorite character of all is Misoki, she is beautiful, has pure heart, innocent, and always laughing. I believe this show will appeal to most people and won't cause any regrets."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Reality show that gives you a glimpse into Japanese relationships and culture,"I found out about this show while flying on ANA airlines and watched the movie they had made (Terrace House: Closing Door). The movie was very good, kind of like a long episode of a season, and I was instantly hooked. I was pretty stoked when I found out Netflix would be airing it. I watched 1 episode of ""Boys and Girls in the City"" and was instantly hooked. This is a reality Japanese show that puts 3 young adult guys and girls in a house together. The goal is to develop friendships and to eventually find love, if possible. Sometimes romance happens, other times it does not. The ages range from 18-30. The housemates are free to leave (""graduate"") the show as they please. Every time someone leaves, they replace him/her with a new member, always keeping the same guy to girl ratio. Most of the members are in the acting/modeling industry, so many are good looking, are charming, and/or know how to provide entertainment. They all carry regular jobs (or are searching for one), so they live their normal lives but always come back to live at the house, where most of the conversation/events happen. Sometimes the camera will follow the outside, for when the members go to work (to give us a glimpse of their real world), go on dates, etc. The producers say that there is no script and nothing is rigged. I don't believe this 100% to be true, due to the certain situations that arise that seem a bit forced or suspicious, but it's fun to watch the show and think everything is unscripted. The commentators, famous actors/actresses/personalities in the entertainment industry, provide very entertaining, sometimes hilarious commentary about the members and what transpires everyday. Some of my friends skip through the commentary, but I really enjoy it. I particularly like the chemistry between Yu, Yamasato, and Torii. The subtitles are close to perfection and are able to catch and describe the context of each situation. If you get hooked on the show as much as me and my friends, you'll start rooting for certain people and rooting against others. It's also easy to get attached to them. I believe every member is on some kind of social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) so it is easy to see into their lives from a different angle, even after they graduate. Netflix has partnered with Fuji TV and have provided an excellent and entertaining show that gives us a fisheye view into the lives of Japanese young adults, how they interact, and an unobscured view into Japanese culture. What makes this show special for me is the pure, genuine relationships that develop between the members, and to get an interesting perspective into the minds of Japanese young adults."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,The one reality show I really enjoyed and cried and smiled for!,Comentario no disponible
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Reality at its Best!!!!!!!!!,"Terrance House is addictive to say the least. This is truly Reality at its best. Place 6 total strangers in a home and allow their common or not so common personalities to emerge over time.

What's most interesting is the fact that most enter the home with a certain objective in bettering themselves in one way or another. Whether it be a desire to become less shy, create new friendships or even seeking a dating relationship. Since there are no scripts many times such objectives are not so easily accomplished and can be rather rough, which makes it all the more exciting.

As each episode slowly evolves you may find yourself, ""Being in the shoes,"" of one of the occupants which could have the same similarities as yourself. Eventually the show concludes when all have felt their objectives have been met through normal day-to-day activities. For those whom have not met their objectives the pressure can get tough in which they are must make a decision to stay on the show or simply leave. For the individuals that have created an outstanding friendship with others this can be some what of a tear jerk-er for the departing individual or yourself as well.

To add a little spice to the show there are normally 2 intermissions which involves the hosts and hostesses that narrate the show in the beginning providing a brief summary to the past episode and again near the end of the episode. Truthfully the intermission is somewhat of a breather and allows each to provide their input to what they believe is happening or going to happen. I actually Love it because its funny, outgoing and has great perspectives from different age groups. What's even more great about the break is that there is no holding back. Each host or hostess says what they truly feel and is on their mind about the episode. There are instances where I simply could not stop laughing, especially since one host is a sort of comedian. His look and reactions are totally, one-of-a-kind but so true in wisdom from his standpoint.

Granted not all will enjoy this sort of reality show but in my opinion its true reality and that's what is addictive to me. Reality to the core and Reality at its Best."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Aweseome Show (Good Job!),"I enjoyed a few of the Japanese drama and movies. And this reality show is truly awesome and stunning! I strongly recommend this show. The Japanese girls are hot, gorgeous, fun, and cute. Reality show, can give you a introduction of how people live together in various countries. And it shows how they can overcome conflicts or love triangles etc."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,You'll be hooked instantly! When's the Netflix DVD release of the one base in Tokyo?!?,"I was born in Japan and am 100% Japanese, so I may be a little biased in this review. I absolutely love this addictive Japanese reality show, especially this specific season that is from 2015 and based in Tokyo, Japan. It's very real and Japan needs this because the country has a declining birth rate, the people don't date enough, and also because they need to work on communicating their emotions better in every day life, and with their love partners. The commentary team that is included before and during the intermission of each episodes of this first season of Netflix 'Terrace House - Boys and Girls in the City: Tokyo' is hilarious and very entertaining. Please, release the DVD for this show Netflix (at least the one based in Tokyo). I want to own it! Thank you Fuji Television & Netflix!"
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Reality in it's purest form,"Terrace house encapsulates what it means to be a reality TV show. I'm so sick of eliminations, challenges, prize money, and roses. The show documents 6 strangers living together and the engagement together nothing more nothing more, nothing less. Members still go to work, go grocery shopping, and have phones. At first, I was expecting something like big brother but japanese reality is another form of reality together. To enjoy this show, you need to have an open mind and your preconceptions about reality from western TV shows need to be abolished. Beautiful Camera work."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Interestingly Intriguing,"A friend recommended this show. I watched an episode to get a feel then turned it off immediately.

After 10 minutes, I decided I shouldn't have given up on it so quick just because it started slow.

I'm glad I did because the show progress pretty fast as the days, then episodes shown, go on at the Terrace House.

Observing people's behavior is so fascinating to me. That's largely the reason why I watched this too. And also because I love the Asian culture."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,The only reality tv show worth watching!,"I'll be honest, my friend had to introduce this show to me despite my own interest in all things Japan and Netflix. I'm also not a big fan of reality tv, this show is completely different. It seems a lot more genuine and there is little to no interference from the production.

It's a very simple premise, 6 strangers live in the same house but otherwise carry out their normal life (going to work or school as usual). They can join and leave whenever they like, they don't have to have a specific motive to be there. Some want relationships other want friendships but it gives free rein to the housemates. They do have an outside cast of what I assume are celebrity personalities and/or comedians who weigh in on the events and give a quick rundown of previous episodes. It is a different style of humour so it could be hit or miss for some people but it is pretty enjoyable either way.

I hope that Netflix stick with this show, I feel that subbed series and films often get the short end of the stick in Europe."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,What A Good Reality Show.,It's incredible how entertaining other people's lives can be when watched through a screen. And it also helps that the commentators are quite witty and funny.
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Best. Reality. Series. Ever.,"I've seen a lot of reality series and by far, Terrace House is the best ever!! As a Japanese culture loving person from Guam I definitely recommend this to all ages! Uhh!! Love Terrace house!!"
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,"It's OK, casting isn't the best","Some other reviews seem a bit bizarre, e.g. '... most interesting is the fact that most enter the home with a certain objective in bettering themselves in one way or another'.

It's not so interesting when you realize that many of these people that are cast for Terrace House enter the house have with the simple objective of furthering (or starting) a modeling/entertainment career vs. this 'relationship' atmosphere that the series plays up & the commentators talk about.

I certainly wouldn't call this 'true reality'. That being said, yes, some things do happen, and, yes, some people are there for reasons other than fame. It's these people that are worth watching."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,I don't understand,"Please help. I managed to sit through 3 episodes and i still do not understand why anyone would enjoy this or why this has such a high rating. Please do not tell me that i didn't give it chance. i tried, but nothing happens. The shots a painfully long and almost silent. The commentators are extremely cringe, and make drama out of nothing. Because there is nothing. This is a show about normal people in a nice house doing absolutely nothing. people tell me this is a reality-TV revolution. But i'd rather sit through 10 seasons of Jersey shore then another episode of this, at least something happens there."
Terrace House: Boys & Girls in the City,Best Reality TV Series,"While the hosts can be a little mean sometimes (even to each other--poor Yamasato lol) they are also warm, spontaneous, and hilarious. I love how everyone is so natural and honest on the show including the hosts and how everything is so real and unscripted. It's a big difference from Singles Inferno, which just feels superficial in comparison. Being a Japanese reality tv show people also don't get into nasty screaming matches and fist fight like certain participants on American reality tv shows, which can feel very unpleasant to watch. Terrace House showcases the perfect blend of interpersonal conflict while maintaining consideration for housemate dynamics. There were a few cringe moments like when one participant had an emotional meltdown because of something minor that turned out to be a trigger for bigger issues. I love that this show isn't about just romance and finding a romantic partner but also about how human beings learn to relate to each other, experience interpersonal conflicts, and try to solve those conflicts. It is the kind of education on communication and developing better relationships that many of us do not get enough of. Although my interpersonal relationships haven't always been very good, I feel like I am learning healthier ways to relate to other people on this show. You do this by setting your boundaries and knowing when you are wrong (you apologize) and when you are right (you hope for an apology). Truly, this show goes beyond just romance. The hosts do a great job of calling out b.s. When they see it while still being kind and tolerant of human imperfections. I love this show and plan on watching the entire series!"

Mucize,Makes you watch but not worth,It is a good series but so much exaggeration. Should be more realistic!!
Mucize,House MD meets Monk,I did not watch the original one. Turkish version is all I can review. The actor who plays autistic doctor makes the difference. And makes the series worth watching. The the other actors are mediocore.
Mucize,Worth watching.,Good series but it's too long and boring with too many patient cases that prolongs the storyline. It really gave me a headache.
Mucize,My opinion,The best Turkish series for this year ... Actor shred the role in a stunning manner. All the staff are great
Mucize,Deitra,"This show is really, really good. There's one episode now, the American and Korean version, but in the Turkish version, the actors are very good and beautifully made."
Mucize,Mucize Indeed!,"This series took me to another world. Its one of the very few times I actually feel the connection with the cast, their acting is extraordinary. Ali, the main character is the type of characters that you will never forget in your life. His acting fascinated me and it actually affected the way i see things in the real world.

Thank you for all the Cast and Crew for such a great great series! I'm addicted! <3"
Mucize,Meh,I ve seen both American and Korean versions Script is obviously good but the problem with the Turkish version as always is the exaggerated acting.. does not ket toy her in the show there's something fake i know everybody's in love with the main characters acting but yea it's super exaggerated Plus as a nurse i can clearly say they need more advice from actual doctors etc
Mucize,The belief,"Amazing series so far, i enjoyed ever episode, i truly believed that the actor is having autism not just acting, music is unbelievable and so touchy, series full of drama and tears but also it contains lot of morals and inspirations... Well done, Turkish series became perfect like American series ( acting, script, music, camera shots) , taking into consideration every single detail... çok güzel 👌🏻"
Mucize,Overrated,"The original korean version still the best. This is good but not in that level. At the beginning was good but now its really annoying. Clichés and the actor's performances are really overdone, excessive and exaggerated."
Mucize,Amazing doctor ❤😍,Comentario no disponible
Mucize,All movie is about worrying for Ali 👎👎👎,"Why Ali Vefa is always sad or in and bad condition, why he always suffer ? People that attack him always 🤷‍♂️ NAZLI is always worried for Ali ... Hospital director that behave bad to Ali after Adil Erinç death? Too much drama 👎"
Mucize,Watch that,"This is the best Turkish series of this year. Ali is a autism boy, he live in Samsun to move Istanbul (Turkey's most population city) for a Private Hospital. And then you'll see it you watch."
Mucize,All the elements of a good show.,This is the best series turkey has seen for almost over 2 decades. Given that the turkish TV is littered with terribly written lame love stories month after month a series narrated this well was truly a refresher. The acting and filming is peak in this version of the show. and it doesn't rely on lame gimmicks to make the audience feel emotional. of course it also has its faults (f.e the dragged out episodes) but I'm not complaining.
Mucize,Exaggerated feelings and drama,They are trying to make you feel sad and emotions in an exaggerated way... Making it look more fake and unrealistic.
Mucize,DOCTORSHIP IS A MIRACLE,"Firstly a very nice series. If you are thinking of becoming a doctor in the future or are interested in the medical field, you should definitely watch it. It is a very exciting series. Your desire to become a doctor will increase even more. The actors play wonderfully. It teaches us that if we want to become a doctor, we should never give up, we should stand strong in the face of certain difficulties, and no illness can stop us from becoming a doctor. I repeat, it is an absolutely amazing series. It will make your dreams stronger. Special thanks should be given to the actors in the series because they created a very strong, determined and fearless character. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH IT..."
Mucize,"Bad, just bad","You only need (if you just switch channels) a glance to realise this effort is just a soap opera imitation. Nothing else. As a franchise, the original series is badly treated here and, personally, I think there is no clue to see a better development. A pity because the Turkish TV has real talent."
Mucize,.....!!,Comentario no disponible
Mucize,Such a terrible script!,First my opinion is A Miracle has a terrible script! Quotes are very bad. The scriptwriters should quit her/him job immediately! They're just thinking once on quotes. You can understand it so easily because as I said quotes are very bad. I'll never talk about the script. Everything is ridiculous about script anyway. I say it again the scriptwriters should quit her/him job immediately! I've finished my words.
Mucize,Just loved it 😘,"I don't need to say anything about it because it is such an great series very long episode of 2 hours and 2 hours 30 min but I still watched it Continuously for 10hours everyday took me 10 to 15 days almost . (Average calculated time Approximately)

I LIVE IN INDIA 🇮🇳🙏"
Mucize,brilliant drama -India,We are from India. This web show is dubbed in all Indian local languages. Brilliant drama. All the best to the complete team.
Mucize,Please dont watch this,Comentario no disponible
Mucize,ali vefa played role of a life time,"Role played by ali vefa and ezo are the most happening and the only reason I watch this show

Love ali and ezo as couple

Love India."
Mucize,"Started so good ,than just plain awful",First episodes were fantastic but after 5 or 6 episodes it started resembles to an emotional trainwreck.. Too much of everything.too emotional for a medical series...damm it's too emotional .period. Not good.not good at all.
Mucize,Very nice,Thank you for this series to gain turkey. Nice production
Mucize,Like watching paint dry,The story lines are so drawn out like watching something in slow motion The production is very clever because it literally goes around in circles and very limited story lines which are padded out for long periods with out much happening ...watch it and you will see what I mean but my wife loves it !!!

Wild District,Great Colombian S1 episodes,"I loved this series. A different type of story compared to these days formula type series es .Even though it is dubbed in American English, by the expression I can tell the performance was great overall. Nicolás Quiroga Pineda has taken the series in different level . Couple of episodes I watched twice because it was so sensual and full of romance.Can't wait for the Season 2"
Wild District,Apparently my first familiarisation with Colombian series - and I am pleased,"Being an admirer of BBC and Scandinavian crime series, from time to time, I am eager to widen my horizons and see what is going on in other countries. Well, I have seen many Spanish-language ones, including from Latin America, but still - the countries there are different vis-a-vis history and current issues. In spite of the fact that I had no awareness of the approach and performers (incl. Juan Pablo Raba - I have not seen Narcos yet), the Series seemed catchy from almost the beginning, and the flashbacks provided necessary background to realise what whas going on and why some characters thought and acted as they did.

All the cast seemed appropriate and with mutual chemistry, and the ending let some things open, so a sequel might be envisaged. Anyway, I will be looking to watch the possible next season as well."
Wild District,"Too much Daniela, not enough Jhon Jeiver","Season one was phenomenal, near perfect. Season 2 gets bogged down by overplaying Daniela's story. I still like the show, but the pace seems to grind to a near halt at times."
Wild District,Absolutely fantastic!!!!,"The acting is outstanding and so is the plot. Very accurate of Colombian current events, including the peace treaty with the illegal armed groups , the FARC and paramilitaries, as well as corruption, although it's not a true story. The first two episodes are a little slower but when it picks up, you don't want to stop. Watch it in Spanish with close caption. That way you get the reality of the acting. It's just so real and the panoramic views of Bogota are stunning. This is quality! Can't wait for the second season"
Wild District,"Awesome, deep story. Definitely worth watching.","As a Colombian I watched the first 3 seasons of Narcos and laughed at the series, mainly because it's a blatant historically and culturally innacurate story. 'Distrito Salvaje', although fictional, is incredibly accurate on identifying the soul of Colombian reality, daily life and culture. It's not a superficial cocaine-plot story like many others, it's about family, love, dreams, frustration and corruption in a violent society struggling to transit to peace. I definitely recommend it, 10⭐."
Wild District,Must Watch. You can't find many Guerrilla stories told in this way.,"Finally, a series of the FARC with perseverance, with incredible dialogues, with strong actors and a spectacular setting. Although I consider myself a follower of what happens in the Latin American continent, as a Puerto Rican, I had never heard anything about the 'Los Pisa Suave'. It's important to know the histories of our countries, and of all the social, economic and political structures that indirectly or directly were and are affected by the actions of the FARC. The way in which the producers and directors represent the city of Bogotá is impressive. Many movies and series only show us the beautiful and spectacular parts of these cities, but the way they collect the reality of the poor and deprived neighborhoods of Colombia is epic, the photographic shots of those concrete jungles, as Lavoe would say, are magnificent and brutal; and at the same time they give an exceptional weight to the reality they want to transmit to the viewer. Juan Pablo Raba returns to demonstrate why he's one of the best Colombian actors of today, surpassing the quality he had presented in 'Narcos', 7 Years, 'The 33' and El Cartel De Los Sapos'. It's difficult to find good productions of the FARC, that even with certain touches of fiction, can keep the spectator in suspense, waiting for the right moment to present the actions that give the turns corresponding to the plot. Another great Netflix production, which continues to seek correct ways to bring Latin American stories to the global conglomerate of society, such as Univision and Telemundo tried to do, but have failed in most of their attempts. Hope for a second season."
Wild District,Absolutely Real,"As Colombian and Bogota's citizen and living the real life.. this serie show to all people the truth about the politicians, their conflicts, scams, and so many immoral behaviors during all day.. every day this is our own reality show. The filmography, the music, the spaces.. makes a real atmosphere about the facts that are happening in our city and our country.. Chapeau for everybody en this project."
Wild District,Wish there was a season two,Comentario no disponible
Wild District,I could not stop waching this,I have to confess that I almost failed a test because I didn't study for a weekend and instead i was watching this. The characters are captivating and the story easy to understand.
Wild District,"Season 1 Great, Season 2 Tedious",Great plot and execution in Season 1. Season 2 is completely far-fetched and tedious. S2 drags on and on and on.
Wild District,As real as it can get,This is a crude representation of the worst disease for a country. Corruption is the real source of all evils it feeds itself like snake eating it's tail.
Wild District,"DISTRITO is not as good as NARCOS... and not as bad as some soup operas, somehow it falls right in the middle","This Netflix Original show starts on a low key and stays there for too long... first couple of episodes are very slow, some parts are boring and painful to follow, with too many clichés & predictable plots, common places and gazillions of cheap exposition using tv ""news"" to fill the blanks in the story (it's a visual medium after all, so show and don't tell), then add a couple of troublesome unrealistic sequences (like killing a hit-man in front of your residence and hide right there with your son... in the second floor, watching trough a window... no police, no bad guys coming to pick up the dead body and finish their job, no hurry to runway!!!). But if you have patience... and get though the first 4 episodes... then the series kicks in and entertains, not because of the action, fights and bullets (there are way better options for that), but because we see the drama unveils as the struggles on Yei Yei's life take a toll on him, his son Mario, his family and that's where the strength of Distrito lies on: the human conflicts, everything else ( corruption, politicians and news reporters) some times is over the top... Just to be clear, DISTRITO is not as good as NARCOS... and not as bad as some Hispanic soup operas, somehow it falls right in the middle, and that could be good enough for a lot of people, but maybe not enough for a second season... time will tell."
Wild District,Interesting but hard work to watch!,"This is a very poorly produced series that is rooted in the reintegration and assimilation of FARC guerillas in Colombia. The story has all the usual cliches of any one of a hundred other Telenovelas, the self-sacrificing mother, the resentful son etc. The acting is at the level one would expect from most Telenovelas i.e. very poor.

The main focus for the story is how the experience of being a ""child guerilla"" has impacted someone's life, and how this continues even through adult life and extends to relationships, family etc.

As has been mentioned, the first few episodes are slow, uninteresting and it's just hard work to stay engaged. It is not suitable for binge watching but rather is best watched in short spurts when there is nothing else in the streaming queue. It is just an average production and probably one that the streaming site will review before deciding to renew."
Wild District,Outstanding S1. Waiting for S2.,Wild District is a really good colombian tv series. You will not want to stop watching it. Every episode is accurate at cultural level and shows the daily battle that most of the colombian people face in their lives. I hope there will be a second season.
Wild District,Truly excellent,"I loved this series and I hope Netflix will have a second season at least. They really should! Characters are interesting and complex, each with their amount of darkness. Nobody is just good, and few are just bad. That is what makes this not a usual silly series. I highly recommend it. The lead character Ye Ye is truly an excellent actor and has a bright future. He makes you care even though you realize he is no saint. I wasn't expecting anything when i started the series but I was hooked immediately."
Wild District,Awesome political thriller,"Very gripping, fast paced and compelling, a series about the fight against corporate mafias with real command in the arena of the disputed political power in Colombia. A former undercover Farc guerrilla and a female prosecutor wield a crusade against them. Acting of the cast great. Very real and with frightening action scenes."
Wild District,Just a few words to describe this show,"Best. Show. Ever.

I ending up calling out of work to binge watch this show, I may have lost some money, but it was worth it!

Do yourself a favor and watch this show, and hope Netflix renews it!!!"
Wild District,Excellent tv show,"I'm so happy to see a really well done tv show about the reality in Colombia, a lot of action and interesting story"
Wild District,Excellent series,Well this was a wonderful surprise. Great acting and storyline that unfolds at a perfect pace allowing you to really engage with all the characters. Lots of action with a well written family plot thrown in. I have only seen the 1st series and eagerly await for the second series to air in Australia.
Wild District,A good first try.,It´s the first netflix series all produced and filmed in Colombia. Its a good try. Main character (Juan Pablo Raba) and his son story is an interesting plot and they should focus more in them than everyone else. There are too many subplots and the viewer can lost narrative thread in the way. I hope they´ll reduce the number of characters and subplots for the season two.
Wild District,Great Series,Great plot Raba is the Colombian Jason Bourne...his acting was spot on..great series hope for season 2..
Wild District,Window on Colombia,"I had a good time watching this. The main character Jhon seemed to have been trained by the Swordmasters of Ginaz in the way he vanquished each and every opponent and sometimes many.

The characters seemed real to me as did the situations they found themselves in. And there was plenty of human interest on the sidelines to distract from what could have been a relentless diet of fighting and criminality.

Some reviewers have liked the second season less than the first as there was less ""action"" in it, being concerned with an election campaign. I actually thought the balance was better here. There was intrigue aplenty both amongst the ex guérillas and on the campaign trail.

I'm glad I had both seasons to hand. I watched both in a short time frame back to back. A definite recommendation."
Wild District,Not that wild,Comentario no disponible
Wild District,A different kind of Colombian story,"Good acting and some unpredictable scenes. The most remarkable thing is that the serie is out of the cliche, stereotypical and old fashioned colombian stories about drug trafficking, military warfare, etc..."
Wild District,Masterpiece,"As a Narcos original series lover I just discovered by chance this one. All I have to say is this one is a little masterpiece. First, even violence is lower than Narcos the action and crimes scenes are pretty well filmed. Second, Bogota scenarios are simply realistic and amazingly chosen. Last, acting is superb. Main character is amazing. Secondary actors too. Some familiar faces from Narcos too. So, overall an amazing series."
Team Kaylie,,
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,gives me hope about the future of (not) television,"I loved this show. I despise the unreality of ""reality TV"" but this belongs, I suppose, at the edges of that genre. It also belongs at the edges of the late night talk show genre, but with a host who engages rather than quizzes and allows guests to shill their current project...and the content here is often deeper and more interesting than the typical talk show's. The ""story"" is simply: Jerry picks up a comedian (or two) he is friends with, driving an amazing classic car, and they go for coffee, sometimes a meal, and they talk.

Though of course there must be a crew of sound and camera people, you don't feel as if there are; you feel as if you're a fly on the door handle of the car or on the diner table (some of the diners where they got coffee no doubt had those), eavesdropping on comic geniuses reminiscing and riffing what seems to be spontaneously on various ideas. For instance, Joel Hodgson and Jerry fall into a routine about advertising the upside-down ketchup bottle, Jerry playing the junior executive with some bad news to impart, and Joel being the impatient CEO with opera tickets who wants to get going, and they are very funny. They make each other laugh, too, and there is no sit-com reason to avoid breaking character and not laugh. So the viewer's sense is that we're sitting at a table with two or three funny friends and watching them go at it, and it's really enjoyable.

The final episode isn't entirely funny--it's damned moving. It's not only deeply philosophical at points, but shows some of the dark sides of comedy, and it moved me to tears.

It strikes me that the episodes were a perfect length for what they were--you wanted more. And there's something else you can't do on TV, eh? 22 minutes or 44, and nothing else, but a web show can be any length, providing different opportunities for creativity. I'm usually depressed by watching network TV shows, but this show made me feel optimistic about the future of entertainment and anxious to see what else is coming.

Terrific job, an idea that may sound odd at first blush but that worked perfectly."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Genre-defining and brilliant break out series,"Seinfeld boldly defined a new genre with this series, defying convention and putting fans first. So much is different about this series: It's distributed only on Crackle and his own dedicated web site, the episodes are an usual 14-18 minutes long, the format itself is unique, and the sole sponsor Acura created customized advertising content that they integrated into the show.

Each show follows this same formula: Jerry Seinfeld invites a legendary comedian out for coffee. He picks them up at their house or mansion in a different and rare classic car. You could watch this series just for the classic cars. In fact if you check IMDb you will find that people who watch this show also watch Top Gear. You might find a bit of Top Gear here, especially when it comes to simultaneous admiring and poking fun at the cars.

The famous comedians you meet are the top comedians of our time and Jerry has known many of them personally for decades, so anyone who's particularly into comedy will especially appreciate this series. He ranges from Jay Leno to Sara Silverman and Louis CK, and Chris Rock, to name a few.

And although you'll see GoPro's all over the inside of each car, along with a chase car or two, you are still there eavesdropping on an intimate conversation between two friends. They're not trying to create an illusion with the production crew staying out of the way, nor are they in your face either. This isn't an interview, and it's not a reality show either. It's something else, something new. Something happens to friends when they go for a drive in a classic car and just hang out.

This format works extra-ordinarily well in the unusual 14-18 minute time length Jerry makes each episode. Each episode features a different classic car, with Jerry describing the characteristics of the car that make it special for him. One wonders whether the cars are somehow matched to the personalities of the comedians. Then Jerry calls them up, and Jerry says something like, ""So I'll pick you up in 15 minutes for coffee."" He drives to their house / mansion, picks them up, and off they go to a unique coffee shop. Sometimes they have other impromptu adventures along the way.

Jerry and Acura obviously collaborated closely on this, as the customized advertising content from Acura is integrated into each show. The commercials match the retro/classic era of the cars they drive, and are downright funny themselves. Each episode features comical Acura product placements, so that after watching a few episodes you begin to play a game of ""Where is the Acura product placement going to be in this one?"" This is advertising genius."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Jerry thinks he's better than the President,"Possible Spoil Alert--This is a general overview of Jerry Seinfeld himself. The comedians on the show make the show. Jerry is just the inventor of it. I would give a better rating if Jerry Seinfeld didn't have such airs about himself. At first he seems very personable but later he makes comments to his guests that makes you wonder if he likes his fans or just 'regular' people at all. As time goes by I find myself liking Jerry Seinfeld less and less. However, the guests do their best and I find myself interested in the person whether they are funny or not. The cars are somewhat interesting to someone who really doesn't care about cars but not as interesting as the comedians themselves. Jerry does a good job doing nothing, just not great at being humble or very interesting himself."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Little nugget of somewhat indulgent gold.,"It's a novel concept and rolls stand-up comedy, reality TV and our fascination with celebrities into one little bite-sized but right-sized segment.

The show is not constant laugh-out-loud humour and initially may appear not to live up to the high expectations which inevitably attach to a Jerry Seinfeld venture. You might even feel torn between the desire to watch, and the unwillingness to admit that you're interested in watching a celebrity get a cup of coffee.

But drop your guard, watch a few episodes, and you will realise that the creators do not intend to suggest that you have nothing better to do than watch their mediocre moments. Rather, this show is the loving little side-project of someone who just wants to share their passion for cars, comedy and the subtleties of human relations."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,As down to earth as it gets,Comentario no disponible
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Real interaction, great content.","First off, I love how the car is intuitively matched to the subject. It's hilarious because an inanimate object is worth a thousand words.

Jerry has phenomenal access to these guys and can relate as a professional peer. How often do you get to listen in on that type of conversation? These guys are giants and might have been around the block a few times. I think that's incredible. I especially enjoyed Bob Einstein's episode and Larry David's incognito moves in the diner.

Something that came to mind for me was how nice it is to see someone stay true to who they are and what they think is funny. It's also good to see comedians sussing out what exactly is funny about something, finding the funny or following the game as kids say nowadays.

I wouldn't mind seeing expanded versions, or repeat visits to some of these people.

Overall it's some of the best webseries content I've ever seen. I enjoy real talk (Dinner For Five with Jon Favreau would be another show) and can't wait to see more episodes of this online."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,I super love this show!,"As an earlier reviewer stated, I had very high expectations for Jerry Seinfeld. Afterall, I built my Thursday night around him for 9 years! When I watched the first episode, I thought, ""meh"". Then I gave it another try, then another, and another, and then consumed every single one of them and they got better and better as they went along. I watched them in no particular order either. I want more. I have to say, it is just totally enjoyable and I feel like a student watching the masters at work. They know that a camera is on them and I am quite certain that there are amazing conversations that never make it to the precious few minutes we get, but what comes across is genuine and warm and as with the last one I watched with Michael Richards, totally moving. I choked up and teared a bit on the last minute or so. I was not expecting that and this is what's best about this show. Please Jerry, make more!"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Review of seasons 1-6,"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is a show that has been around for a while, but has only recently arrived on Netflix here in Australia. I've never been a huge fan of Jerry Seinfeld so it wasn't high on my list of shows to watch, but a scan down the guest list revealed a number of familiar names: Jim Carrey, Christoph Waltz, Tina Fey, Barack Obama, Will Ferrell, Alec Baldwin, Ellen Degeneres, Eddie Murphy, Sarah Silverman, Seth Rogen, and Ricky Gervais, to name just a few.

There is also a lot of people that I have never heard of, and those episodes became more background TV to me, but the episodes with the familiar faces were quite interesting.

The setup is that Seinfeld, each time in a different kind of vintage or rare car, picks up the guest, and they drive somewhere for coffee. We get to hear their conversation on the drive and at the coffee spot, and the relaxed nature of it all make it quite engaging. They talk about life, comedy, reminisce about old times, it's great. It was nice to see some of these big names chilled out and shooting the breeze with their friend Jerry.

If you haven't watched any episodes, I reckon its worth having a look. Its good rainy afternoon viewing."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,a lot of something about nothing,"It's one of the best web series around. On every episode, Jerry Seinfeld drives a fellow comedian in a car and gets coffee. Of course, the cars and the coffee are secondary. It's Jerry and friends. Most of time, it is hilarious or at least very funny. It's comedians shooting the breeze. It's very rare when the show falls completely flat. The only one that comes to mind is Todd Barry. He's so mellow that the show almost stops dead. Every show has some old story, funny bits, recalling old times, or theories on comedy. The names of the guests are a compelling list of who's who in comedy. It's one of the very few web series that can truly be called must-see."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,More like a series of awkward moments,"In the spirit of ""A show about nothing"" it looks like Seinfeld has actually tried to do that and ended up with a series of lacklustre meets. There are one or two interesting and engaging episodes BUT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE GUEST - NOT THE HOST! The continual references to this bygone or that bygone have become a get out for a boring, often depressed guest and Seinfelds attempts at impromptu laughs mostly bomb and are often awkward revealing a very poorly grounded and uneven rightish wing stance which he clumsily covers up with a ""but everything is humor"" philosophy. So much so that It's nauseating at times. The whole thing is basically one giant rich man's mid life crises. Its a shame because the ""Seinfeld"" series is still pretty fresh and relevant to today's world. But as in life - you're only as good as your last gig."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Only the tires of his cars are inflated,"This is truly a great show. It gives you a look into the minds of the best comedians on the planet. And no, Seinfeld's ego is not inflated, only the tires of his cars. It's a show people. If you listen carefully you can learn a lot about comedy. Love it!"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Good show but not funny,"It is a good show but not funny. It is a casual conversation with famous people, so even though there are lots of comedians in some episodes I do not even smile. It is not like other shows which usually are like interviews but a normal and sometimes boring conversations with once a while nice surprises. I think it is best to chose an episode which involves your favorite famous person and watch that episode to recognize that person like regular person not like a celebrity. I am also not a fan of cars so I just skip that part. Also I do not understand that weird cuts to filling coffee to cups lots of times. OK, I saw it! So in conclusion it is a fine but boring work with rare brilliant moments."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Sometimes Ok, Often Cringe-Worthy","My wife and I cherrypicked about 10 episodes, I feel like we got a pretty good cross section. Quickly realized that the funniness of the show depends entirely on the guest and their ability to tolerate Jerry.

He often asks pointless and awkward questions which even the guests visibly cringe at. Jerry doesn't really seem interested in talking about substantive things with the comedians, he has rather low regard for people he considers less funny than himself, and treats his comedy career as if he's Jonas Salk.

I went into this show somewhat indifferent toward Jerry Seinfeld and came out quite put off by him. The show deserves some credit for the array of guests. The cars are cool too, despite how mind-numbingly self indulgent that aspect is. It really speaks to Jerry's personality that he combined his favourite things into a show, but the part that the audience might care about (asking the guests questions) often feels like an afterthought."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Comedians telling anecdotes,"First of all this show is all about two comedians(rarely accompanied by a third guest) telling each others anecdotes mostly regarding comedy biz and having conversations that remind us the ones Jerry and George were having in the Seinfeld. The concept of driving to get a coffee and the coffee place are simply the stage of the show where the comedians have their conversations. The cars and the coffee places are not really the subjects of the show. So do not expect great deal of information about the cars. Jerry tells about the cars so little as to make a mere introduction of the machines they are going to enjoy as part of the day. As a Turkish person who lives in Turkey where the comedy is made by few people and mostly with poor taste, i really admire American comedy which is very rich with its many comedians and concepts and i still discover this great comedy culture. This shows brings a lot of young comedians and legends to screen(of the internet) and they tell amazing stories in the tone of a friendly, casual get- together. A great example of one of these moments in the show, was when Jimmy Fallon told an anecdote about Jack Nicholson and Cracker Jacks. The concept of the show is very smart for revealing these moments. In this sense, it is similar to a late night talk show only it is more relaxed and the guests are exclusively comedians. Very entertaining and original. i hope to see many seasons of this show, with comedians like Larry David, Louis CK, Ricky Gervais and Jimmy Fallon reappearing along with legends."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Smart, funny, mature","Seinfeld has always been classy and thoughtful and this show echoes the originality of his TV series ""Seinfeld."" It's a thinking-person's style of humor with great stories, unique personalities, and down-to-earth situations that make viewers feel like we are a part of these comedians' lives, at least for a moment. The combination of a car, a guest, and a coffee shop is a very Seinfeld-esque quirky that has that ""wish I'd thought of it"" feel to it. I've been able to introduce several family members and friends by hooking them from different angles. My car-loving brother-in-law likes the car selections, my sister likes the human behavior angle, and my friend just likes to see some favorite comedians. I enjoy all of the above, plus the artfully selected filming angles. The whole show is a pleasure. My wife and I have re-watched several of the episodes. Even the commercials seem to blend elegantly with both the theme of the show and the delivery style. Arriving in a world flooded with entertainment, CCC is a fresh and invigorating show. I hope Seinfeld continues to expand the series, as I want to meet more people and hear more conversation!"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Watched all of them. Twice!,"Even the painful Barack Obama one. YEESH! All in all Jerry is unflappable. Even when the cars break and guests suck. No matter how bad or boring the guest, Jerry picks them up, dusts them off and makes them look good. Admittedly, I have a soft spot for the cars. For me it's the best part. The other really amazing part is that no matter the guest, the entire show is worth watching for anyone. No on should be politically offended. No one will be worn out by the toilet humor, as there is none. No one will be put off by the subject matter. Like Jerry, it's all clean, unoffensive and universal. Hilarious at times. Boring at times. Mostly just interesting, informative and enlightening. YES! Jerry is a bit arrogant at times. But, If I had come to be worth over a billion dollars, had amassed the best collection of Porsche cars in the world outside of the museum in Stuttgart, had a 22 million dollar jet, a beautiful wife, three great kids and had accomplished more then most humans by a factor of about ten, I guess he deserves to be a bit cocky.. I would be too. He's earned the right to not be incredibly humble. Great show."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Great interviews, great personalities...","The chemistry between Seinfeld and each of the interviewees is just magic. The episodes should be longer though, you just don't get enough time for the subjects to become completely natural. OK, so this type of thing will never be 100% authentic, but watching these are still a beautiful experience. The cars are awesome, would love to drive some of these beautiful vehicles."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Surprisingly entertaining,"Some episodes are better than others (obviously), but I really like the short, light-hearted episodes."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Love It!,"I Love the unscripted, honest aspect of the show. I just read a few bad reviews from The Washington Post and realize that whoever hires those writers suck and make crap up,based on their sad, pathetic lives. For example, and this is not an exact quote, but they said Seinfeld is"" out of touch with real people and the expensive cars on the show are an example of how out of touch he is with real people, displaying the gap between the wealthy and non wealthy"". Really??? I am far from wealthy and gee, I never noticed that, because it doesn't exist on this show. I LOVE the show. Who cares if they have more $ and can afford the nice cars..(Seinfeld doesn't own them...just props for his show), but even if he did, so what? He worked exceedingly hard as do the celebs on his show and deserve those cars, Washington Post. I have and always will be a Jerry Seinfeld fan. I will watch this show as long as it is on and hope for it's continued success.It's real, shows the genuiness of Jerry and other fave actors and celebrities and is a terrific show.I would add, however, that I think it would be just as fun to do a ""Comedians in Cars Getting a Beer""!! Terrific show!!"
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Filler guests,At some point it started being comedian and a celebrity getting coffee. The main selling point of the show completely missing.
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,This show is like a comfort food,"This is a show that I rewatch whenever I need some ""comfort watching"". It funny, sometimes silly, always smart and interesting conversations, very relaxing. The concept of the show is genius, just doing what you want to do: drive, enjoy the weather, good food and coffee and just exchange ideas and laughs between friends."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"Relaxed, intelligent and fun","S11E07 is THE ONE episode every episode should be like. Ok, obviously if EVERY episode were similar to THAT one the show would lack variety, become stale, predictable, yada yada yada, but, if every episode was as relaxed, fluent, spontaneous, serendipitous, unassuming, intelligent and sapio-logically funny then I'd rate a 10 through and through, but then again, who am I."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Watchable but...,"I think the concept is ok. Nice cars and comedy legends make it interesting. The Jazz gives it a nice urban feel. The problem with the series is Jerry. He's just so arrogant and full of himself and, insofar as comedy goes, he's not that funny. Too many shots of coffee too. It gets old fast. The segment with Mel Brooks made it worth it for me though."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Just started watching and I LOVE it,"I recently discovered this show on Netflix for the first time, watched 2 episodes (with Dave Chapelle and Ellen Degeneres) and I enjoy it so-so much! Why it really stands out for me is that the conversations are so relaxed, just like a casual chat of 2 friends. Topics vary so much, from the most everyday stuff to deep philosophical thoughts on life. No script (at least, doesn't seem like there's any script). Wonderful shots of coffee which I love! Plus the length of each episode is just perfect, not too long, not too short. Jerry Seinfield has a talent for interviewing people and making them feel at ease. Really loved the show."
Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,Where's Conan,I really like how comfortable and easy the show is . It's just still missing the great comedian Conan O'brien .
Summoning Amr's Guardian,,
Baby Fever,Quirky and introspective,"Lead carries the story arc which is a perfect example of a Danish slow burn. She struggles with an internal debate pulling her constantly in oppositional directions. Impulsive choices not always benefit her and often to detriment of those she values dearly. Love and forgiveness are underlying themes, although oddly timed, as is often the case in real time. Highly recommend."
Baby Fever,"Exceptional acting, perfect example of a slow burn","The main actress carries the series from start to finish on her shoulders and does it magnificently! The story takes some time to build momentum but creates a very unique, insightful and heartbreaking conflict between the love for a partner and love for a child.

I am only 19 years old and children are still beyond my horizon but this series gives a great glimpse into the (future) responsibility of parenthood and the difficult choices of women at the end of their 30s, early 40s, who have to decide if they want kids now or never. While I am slowly becoming a young adult this series helped me to understand where I am going to be in 20 years and make present and future decisions accordingly. While the decision of the protagonist to impregnate herself in the last 6 months of being fertile is reckles and morally wrong, the viewer can identify with her and understands her motivation fully.

The resolution of the conflict and collaps of her lies in the last two episodes were long coming. They offer a great opportunity for the protagonist to redeem herself, but also to show the dilemma she is in. Either way she could only lose. Just like most women she was looking for a partner while the clock of her body was clicking. So she had to either rely on fate and fortune to find a partner at the right time, or to take her fate in her own hands while risking the career of a friend and losing her true love.

The music is very subtle, yet fits the overall mood of the series and theme. The characters are believable and storyline builds steadily and slowly. The cinematography, lighting and mood is both scandinavian due to the subdued colors and intimate through the constant focus on the protagonist's struggle."
Baby Fever,An exceptionally satisfying binge-watch,"I just want to add my 8-star rating to this marvelous series. Danish TV in general is pretty great and this particular series is really top-notch. I like it even better than ""Rita,"" which is saying a lot!"
Baby Fever,Season 1,Comentario no disponible
Baby Fever,"Easily an 8 rating, marvellous short series!","First of all a good storyline followed by a brilliant performance! Danish dark comedy with twists and turn! This one is a must watch, not sure why the overall ratings are low."
Baby Fever,... a-dynamic-magnetic-character-performance,"... three hours of Skruk is not enough... or should be said, three hours of Joe Park is not-enough, for she is Baby Fever... the basic premise is simple, yet evolves well-into-not-simple... these productions take nerve and a steady hand to pull-off-well

... Park makes it all come together in a most compelling fashion.. when she's onscreen, you can't turn away... she gives so many different looks to Nana, many times within the same scene... it's a very noteworthy performance in a simple little show... one that all who really like it, look forward with great anticipation to season two, with possibility of season three."
Baby Fever,Excelllent ---funny and very binge worthy,Comentario no disponible
Baby Fever,Brilliant Emotional Tears and Lies about wanting to Get Pregnant - but maybe left it a bit late?,"It starts off fairy simple in a Fertility Clinic in Copenhagen (you can switch the dialog to English), and rapidly gets far more emotionally complicated. I could empathise with all the characters in it, possibly because a colleague at work, knowing my wife and I had children, told me what it was like going to a Fertility Clinic with her husband in London.

They were so desperate to have a baby. This series both recognises, such work friendships, and such love, but takes it to such an emotionally complicated and intense level, that I find it difficult to not watch the next episode to find out what happens next..

Drama at it's Best."
Family Secrets,Every time pushes you to ask questions!,It is a great TV show that's developed by Turkish makers. Ihaven't watched such a TV show before this. Actings are great as well as the scenario. Every time you are assuming or guessing something to find the killer or imagining the what will happen! I hope it will continue in this line and continues to keep us be curioused.
Family Secrets,Interesting crime drama with surprising twists,"Recommend to watch. It's a good break from the romcoms, gangster crime and family dramas. This series starts off pretty well. Lots of surprising twists and cliffhangers. I like the cast. Giving it a solid 8. I find that the plot needs to move faster as the suspect is still stubbornly maintaining his silence. Maybe I'm impatient but at least he finally let out a leading clue to get the story going. The leading roles are a good match. Both are strong, confident and good at their jobs. The mood in this series is heavy and I wish there will be lighter moods thrown in as everyone is wearing a serious long face."
Family Secrets,"Good show with some "" however""","I watched the first episodes with lots of excitement. As the episodes and story move on, I started saying more whys. Why didn't Engin pay for what he did? Instead, he complicated the story and made more problems to everyone even when he's gone. They made Inci (Ceylin's sister ) look like this sweet innocent person and no one in her family acknowledged the mistakes and secret life she led and she also was gone without paying for her mistakes. Ceylin's character also made mistakes and other characters did as well and the story moved on without justice.

Overall, they acting was good even though I liked the main male character more than the main female because I felt she over acted in many scenes ."
Family Secrets,Amazing acting! :O,"Having watched the 2nd episode, I'm fascinated by the talent of the main actress, PInar Deniz, but also Kaan and many other actors. While watching them, you can feel their pain. And you'll see that the mystery of the whole story will make you want to watch more and more. 😊"
Family Secrets,WOW... Shocking and extremely interesting!,"So much suspense! This series is so good that after only 5 minutes, it forces you to continue!

I'm most impressed by the sense of justice in this story... even though you expect the story to go a different way, it keeps surprising you!

In addition, the actors are really talented, especially Kaan UrgancIoglu and PInar Deniz.

Looking forward to the next episode."
Family Secrets,"Wonderful, original & simply perfect!","I've just watched it and I got goosebumps in the end. So exciting from the very beginning, amazing story, brilliant acting, a lot of talent from most actors, especially from Kaan UrgancIoglu (Emir from ""Kara Sevda""). I really hope this series becomes successful."
Family Secrets,Finally something different!,"I've felt that recently Turkish TV dramas started to be predictable and all similar. But with this one, you can't really guess how the story is going to develop, they always surprise you.

I hope it continues to be unpredictable and exciting as it is now."
Family Secrets,Crime and mystery at their highest level!,"I'm not really a fan of series, esp. Romantic ones, but this is something different. No unnecessary drama, just great acting, mystery and a lot of suspense. Well, it wouldn't be bad to have some romance in the end, as well. :)

Anyway, those who say that PInar Deniz's acting was exaggerated in the 2nd episode, are those who have never felt (or imagined) the pain of losing someone. I mean, she lost her younger SISTER whom she loved and protected since they were little. So, in my opinion, she magnificently portrayed that unbearable pain.

As for Kaan UrgancIoglu (ILgaz), he's as handsome as always. :) But, the appearance doesn't really matter, I'm really happy that he finally got his main role, I've been waiting for that since ""Kara Sevda"", I knew someone would finally recognize his great talent."
Family Secrets,Perfect highly recommend,Very interesting and exciting .one of the best crime serieses ever.
Family Secrets,my opinion,"For a long time, I have been excited about a series from the first episode.. I hope that the series continues with this mystery and creativity.

For a long time, I have been excited about a series from the first episode.. I hope that the series continues with this mystery and creativity."
Family Secrets,I Loved this! But...,"What a dumb, stupid ending! Honestly, after all these great episodes, you end it like this?! So totally disappointing! Enjoyed it until the end. But I guess money, advertisers, audience numbers, whatever ... but certainly not creativity made you call it a wrap. Too bad? A really bad ending. From a diehard Turkish TV fan and longtime monthly supporter/subscriber.

Family Secrets,Just wow !,"Its very Different and thrilling! It also marks a rise point in Turkish production as well. Cant say enough the cast, the plot, the events amazing!!"
Family Secrets,Surprising twists with romance on the edge...but it turned out so boring!,"I am enjoying every minute of it. They made a very interesting crime drama free from cliches and surely surprising twists keep you engaging.

Besides romance on the edge makes you fall in love with the characters. The chemistry is amazing!

.... I wrote in the first season sadly it lost every good thing after 2nd season because they even want to earn money by stretching it to 3rd season.

Very sad indeed."

Family Secrets,Suspenseful and exciting series,"Final Episode 95 -- OUTSTANDING, bravo! (Although episode 95 was done for the theme 2.5+ years ago, it was still not genuine and with many technical flaws. Actors got older and their eyes contact are as if they knew each other, Ilgaz's car not the same even if it is Honda SUV, Engin's hair fake, and many more flaws ...)

Season 3: Best of the best! 100/100. Brilliantly written and as always outstanding execution! And yes it still got its wonderful touch in season 3.

Season 2: 20/20 Super duper great story. Wonderfully written and well executed! Sometime a following season is boring and talk talk talk, but not Yargi. It still got its touch in season 2.

Season 1: 10/10 Yargi is an excellent series. Worth to watch it! The series is suspenseful, edgy, sentimental, and does not bore you. A cliffhanger at end of each episode.

'Chapeau bas' to all the actors especially Kaan and Pinar, they have a wonderful sweet chemistry, and of course not to forget the sweet weasel 'Yekta'."
Family Secrets,Lots of interesting characters,Yargi is definitely one of the best series I have watched in a very long time. Not only the leads are excellent but the supporting roles are very good too. The story line is great. Well done so far to the whole cast! Cant wait to see how the show develops further.
Family Secrets,GREAT START TO A SHOW,So far so good I like everything about the two leading actors. But am afraid to love it because Turkey has a bad habit of canceling shows without much warning. Just when things are getting good and you settle in to enjoy the show bam it is canceled.
Family Secrets,Really good drama/crime series,"This has to be one of the best drama/crime series of this season!

Very good acting and the story line is intriguing, funny and very dramatic. Well written and with so many new outcomes every week - let's hope it carries like this for a very long time."

Chief of Staff,Power corrupts,"Lee Jung Jae plays a chief of staff trying to change a corrupt system with the help of the beautiful Shin Min Ah, an assemblywoman of the opposing party. In this well acted drama he is faced with the dilemma that to change the system he has to stoop as low as the people he despises. Well paced with a story that holds the attention and an excellent supporting cast."
Chief of Staff,Excellent Political Thriller,"It can be impossible to follow a complex plot in a foreign language with unrecognisable names. But persevere into episode 3 and the political shenanigans start to become clearer. If you stick with it you will be rewarded.

Many of the strengths of Korean drama are on display here: deft plotting with twists and turns galore; superb acting by all involved; and high production values.

The moral conundrum at the heart of the story serves to raise this a notch higher in my estimation. Highly recommended."

Chief of Staff,A decent but over-simplistic political drama,Comentario no disponible
Chief of Staff,It's good... Real good except...,The show was suspenseful and dramatic just fine. I would only give it a medium rating because watching this old man playing the M. O. J eat in like every other scene was distracting and DISGUSTING. Who's idea was that and please fire them forever. Yuck. Totally took away from potentially powerful scenes. So i guess I'd just say great writing (other than that the genius main character would just leave game changing evidence in his desk drawer. Not believable even for an idiot.) Great cast. Bad directing. Ew made me sick watching him eat.
Chief of Staff,On the verge of meh-ness...,"Although it's politically themed drama but it's a watered-down surface-level politics and the excessive overdramatization didn't fit its theme. Repeating the exact same dramatic flashbacks multiple times throughout both seasons further highlights my point. It ended up relying on these melo moments rather than having a better written political drama and a more engaging dialogues as you would expect from a good political drama to have. What also didn't fit its theme is the male lead constant overreacting and overacting for his role. The romance of the main leads and the pair up of the secondary leads were all out of place. On the other hand, the OST was nice, it reminded me of Comrades (2010). The drama is okay if it was your first political drama, can serve as an easy introduction to the genre."
Chief of Staff,A good political thriller,"The plot, which is complex and full of twists and turns, provides an excellent insight into the cut-throat world of politics. I would have given 5 stars to the series if the romantic relationships had been a little less shallow, which would have helped the viewer care more for the ""good"" characters. The actors are all excellent, with a special mention for Shin Min-a and Lee Elijah, whose roles are unfortunately a bit subdued. In that sense, there is an old-fashioned feel to the show that could have been averted by giving women strong storylines rather than using them as accessories caught in the flow of events."

The Goop Lab,"Awesome acting, dialogue and story","Its been an amazing to watch the acting. I loved Shahid's dialogue delivery, Vijays acting and how he beautifully managed accent and dialects. Fresh story, very good actors and solid punches.

Narration is super crisp, connected and well crafted. After a long time, i watched something natural and no filmy/fancy. Director has hand picked people for each roles and delivered with maximum impact. Each character from Chachu to Firoz to Nanu to Kay Kay has done justice to their roles. This is something you cannot miss if you want to watch powerful acting, thrilling story.

An absolute and a MUST watch."
The Goop Lab,Another Raj & DK brilliance!,"8.5/10

As an ardent follower of Raj and DK and their previous endeavours, I had been anticipating their new show since it was first announced last year, and now that I have finally finished it, I can confidently tell that my patience was rewarded.

It is gritty, it is dark, and most importantly, it puts the emphasis where it was required: on the characters and the places they come from.

Shahid, Vijay, Kay Kay, Raashi; the cast had no shortage of talent, so it was rather a challenge to balance out all of their screentime as well as relevance in the script, which I believe Raj and DK accomplished admirably. Big props to the entire cast too, for their dedication and full commitment to their roles, especially Shahid & Vijay; this is their first time on an OTT platform, and they knocked it out of the park, no doubts whatsoever.

The most impressive thing for me however is that, despite having lengthy episodes (nearly an hour each), I was never bored, not for a single moment. There was always something interesting going on, something cooking, and that kept my mind occupied and engrossed throughout. And I can say the same only for a handful of other shows out there.

I'm already looking forward to the next season!

Bring it on, and bring it on fast!"
The Goop Lab,Farzi - the actual hard work,"I have a habit of fast forwarding scenes but I tell you every single minute here counts.. I had to rewind those 5 - 10 seconds which I missed. This is the perfection and in future it seems to get married to Family man! The hint was dropped in the series!

Every actor, every scene is perfectly crafted and an excellent research on the topic, as if the actual people behind this were interviewed :)

If there is no back ground music and we don't know the actors this might come as a docuseries as well ha ha :) :) - pun intended

Credit to Raj and DK for creating yet another amazing series

Must watch."
The Goop Lab,OUTSTANDING,"FANTABOLOUS No crap just straight topoint.. #ShahidKapoor Just nailed it 👌🏻 but The conversation b/w minister & Sethupathi is the major highlight ... Just wow. And the epic style of dialogue delivery, outstanding👌🏻sense of humour, precise comic timing = VijaySethupathi Sir, He is genius, He again prove there is No need of Six Packs to be a good actor.

The plot itself is the gold-medalist, where the one-liners, actors, characters, writing & humor are the flag-bearers. RajNDK never fails in content. A RECOMMENDED WEEKEND WATCH . Don't miss it just open the prime and enjoy the thrill of RAJ AND DK."
The Goop Lab,Raises the standard of Indian web series....!!!,"When it comes to entertainment Raj & Dk are perfectionalist to the core ,they are completely control of audience pulse and can convince them much better... With a tried not tested kind of plot the duo does take time to settle may be an episode of two,but the path breaking ground work behind each statistics and analysis won't come so easily which is clearly visible on screen but this duo does these kind of things coz they hugely trust the castings and their ability... Bhuvan Arora and Vijay sethupathi stealers of the shows with their natural ability to carry over the screenplay on their shoulder at ease ... When the ""LAST OF US "" are countering problems in seeking attention...this ""FARZI"" depends entirely on the plot based scripting and screenplay supported by superb casting but wait the crackers are just lit watch the fireworks on season 2 for sure u will be out in a roller coaster ride with some visual brilliance..."
The Goop Lab,An original crime caper by Raj & DK,"Farzi is a stellar watch. Raj & DK outdo themselves with this original crime caper. Outstanding storytelling. A dream cast of Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and Kay Kay Menon at the top of their game. Brilliant performances by a terrific ensemble. The writing is sharp and witty, all thanks to Raj & DK along with Sumana Kumar and Sita Menon. The production value is top notch. The cinematography is amazing. The attention to details is the USP of this series. The amount of hard work put on the table by the cast and crew is incredible to watch.

The Goop Lab,Raj & Dk are Back Again..!!,"The series grips up into the world in the first two episodes, and keeps you on the edge of your seat through the last three. Their biggest victory as a story teller lies in the fact that you are relating to the journey of two protagonists - Sunny and Firoz - and there are times when you don't want the characters to take a certain decision, as deep within they are the middle class families, trying to make it big. While there are multiple characters introduced through the 8-episode series, Raj and DK manage to give every character their moment of glory and intertwines it seamlessly into the narrative. Despite being a web series, the emotions of Farzi are very rooted and relatable, something that director duo of Raj and DK have mastered in through their Family Man Franchise and now, Farzi. The entire Zakir Hussain track is a riot and the finest moments of the series lie in the interactions of Micheal and Pawan Gahlot. Farzi isn't just a cat and mouse race between the characters, but also their actors to be at their best. Once again, Shahid Kapoor makes a statement on why he is among the best actors of the country, as he leaves a mark with his act as Sunny. Vijay Sethupathi also makes a powerful digital debut and aces his character of Micheal. What works beautifully is his seamless style of mouthing those sarcastic one-liners as that lends a unique arc to his character. Kay Kay Menon as Mansoor too gets his moments to shine but the best as an actor is kept for the finale. Bhuvan Arora as Firoz is the find of Farzi and one will hear his name frequently in the times to come by. Raashii Khanna too gets an author backed character, playing RBI Officer, Megha Vyas, and is confident through her presence in the series. Can't Wait for Season 2 and also to explore more of this Raj & DK universe..!!"
The Goop Lab,Raj & DK are Back with Another Crime Thriller,"Raj & DK have been hitting it out of the park with their content for a while now. I was introduced to them a little later with The Family Man series in 2019 and have watched a good amount of their content since. The duo is back now with their new series, Farzi. This series is a crime thriller dealing with counterfeit money and some relatable characters with grounded motives, problems, and grey shades.

Farzi is majorly about Sunny, an artist, whose predicaments and financial issues lead him into the world of crime, specifically by counterfeiting money and rising through the underworld through this. The series also follows Michael, an investigative officer, along with Megha, ex-RBI officer, who are on a mission to catch the creator of these counterfeit notes and clean the system. How Sunny meets Michael's nemsis of Mansoor, a major underworld king pin, and gets involved in a larger mess makes up this season.

The series has an interesting premise for sure with the crime thriller set-up, but what makes us love Farzi, much like other Raj & DK works is the groundedness of the characters. They have real problems and characteristics. Michael is dealing with divorce and the emotions of losing custody of his son. Megha is done with being seen as a boring loner, working the boring RBI job. Sunny lost his parents at a young age and was taken care of by his grandfather, who is struggling financially for his press and also falling ill with age.

The standards have been set high for cinematography. Prime did not skimp on the movie and have funded it properly, and Raj/DK made good use of the provided money. The series has great visuals along with the color grading setting a dark tone which works aptly with the crime thriller genre. A gritty setting is used which works well for the story.

The acting is top notch in the series. The best talent has been brought in through Vijay Sethupathi who plays a Tamilian, and his broken Hindi is pleasant to hear along with his dark, dry humour working in dull moments. Shahid Kapoor does well, these dark roles really work for him, although some scenes he looks rather blank. Bhuvan Arora stood out amongst the new talent as Firoz, he is quite a fun side kick. Kay Kay Menon kills it in the role of a Mafia king pin, while Rashi Khanna explores a new side of her self as Megha and delivers well.

As of this initial season, the one issue which irked me with the series was that some parts of the episodes felt lengthy and full. Though the screenplay was good the episodes may have benefited from being 40 min long instead of the hour long episodes we got. There were multiple parts where I was checking how much longer was left. Maybe a schedule release with more gaps between episodes could have benefited in this sense as well.

Overall, a great first season which is bringing us into the world of Farzi. This is a solid crime thriller which is not only a must watch for Raj & DK fans, but also fans of crime/thriller genre.

7.5/10."

The Goop Lab,Wholesome Entertainer,"Overall the web series has 8 episodes all the character development has been very well established with few characters background kept secret which I think will be shown in season 2. All the actors have performed well Shahid Kaoor, Raashii Khanna, K K, Veteran actor Amol Palekar and Bhuvan Arora all are good but Vijay Sethupathi has absolutely nailed in few scenes his Comic timing is so good that one watching will laugh out loud. Vijay Sethupathi performance is a masterpiece and will be loved by all Farzi from starting till the end scene is a absolute thriller , eagerly waiting for Season 2...."
The Goop Lab,It's a Perfect 10,"This show is a Banger . Excellent Cast , Depth in Characters and Brilliant Story Telling. That's how a Crime Thriller should be . Once you Start Watching the Show you will binge it for sure. Shahid Kapoor , Vijay Sethupati , Kay Kay Menon , Zakir Khan, Amol Palekar all are excellent. Can't wait now for S2 as it ended on a High Note. The Universe that Raj and DK are planning is exciting and interesting . Shahid is the Hero of the show and he proves how good actor he is. For me After Mirzapur and Family Man this is the Best Series coming from India Must watch for sure . A Perfect 10 from my side."
The Goop Lab,FARZI(season1):-another winner series from the majestic duo,"Farzi is a crime drama thriller show directed by krishna dk and raj nidimoru.

Shahid kapoor as sunny is outstanding. He portrays a calm yet very ambitious character superbly. Also, shahid possesses a certain mumbai swag in him which he channelizes exceptionally. Vijay sethupathi plays michael and plays it effortlessly. He is nonchalant, careless, but extremely dedicated and workaholic. Vijay's comic timing is very laidback yet effective. Bhuvan arora as firoz shines through the screens. His chemistry with shahid will be remebered for years to come. Both have worked it out so beautifully. Kay kay menon, on the other hand, is a comic ruthless gangster. Whenever kay kay and shahid come together on screen, its fireworks. Ask vishal bharadwaj about haider if you doubt it. Rashi khanna was good, a polite yet dedicated RBI officer. Amol palekar as nanu will surely bring a wide smile on your face as he has done over the long years. The performances are extremely competetive.

The writing in this series is of gold standard. The characters that the makers have etched out is outstanding. You see the characters of sunny and firoz, you feel for them from the first episode itself. Beaten by the system, they want to make a cut by hook or by crook. Michael has personal problems with his wife, you see that he has failed as a husband and father but still you feel for him because of the performance and also due to the context of it. The chemistry between michael and pawan gahlot works big time. They have got the most hilarious and meme worthy dialogues between them. Zakir hussain has played the minister wonderfully.

The commentary this series makes about the system and its corruption, red tapism is very relevant and contemporary. The divisions of class, economic strata divide, how it gives context to people's actions is written beautifully. The screenwriting is a masterclass in itself. For instance, during a chase, the police go back and forth between their car and the perperators in the mumbai traffic. The way the makers have made space for humour in the direst of situations is outstanding. The comedy in general is terrific, this makes farzi a raj and dk show. Also, the detailing and research that has gone behind the notes and currency, its making techniques, the technicalities is marvellous.

The music is astounding as well. The score consists of the generic beats, the synth portions, and it elevates the series further. The music is also pretty good. 'Paisa hai toh', 'fark nai padta', 'sab farzi' are peppy numbers while 'aasmaan' is such a soulful indie vibe. You will like the music for sure. The cinematography is great. There are no speciifc raj and dk long shots but the way the camera angles have been handled gives the premiumness to the show.

The dialogues in this show is just hilarious and outstanding. The scenes between michael and pawan have been largely elevated due to the dialogues.

If we are to say negatives, then i wish the love story between sunny and megha would have been handled better. I mean every character and their chemistry got a closure barring that aspect. So yeah, this is one outstanding show. I rate it 9.5."
The Goop Lab,"""Farzi: A Stylish Con Job""","Farzi is a cat-and-mouse chase, fast-paced crime thriller that blends humor and suspense with aplomb. Raj & DK's signature style is evident in every frame, as they weave a complex tale of counterfeit currency, ambition, and the pursuit of justice.

Shahid Kapoor's portrayal of Sunny Sharma is a revelation. His transformation from a struggling artist to a mastermind counterfeiter is both captivating and chilling. Sunny's intelligence, resourcefulness, and unwavering loyalty to his friends make him a compelling protagonist.

Vijay Sethupathi's Michael is a force to be reckoned with. His intense dedication to his job is matched only by his unorthodox methods. His character arc, from a by-the-book officer to a man willing to bend the rules, adds depth to the narrative.

Bhuvan Arora's Firoz is the heart and soul of the series. His loyalty, innocence, and comedic timing are infectious. His character's growth from a naive assistant to a key player in the operation is heartwarming.

Farzi is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the vibrant chaos of Mumbai, contrasting it with the sleek world of high-stakes crime. The production design is meticulous, creating a believable and immersive environment.

The series effectively balances humor and suspense, keeping the audience engaged throughout. The witty dialogues and unexpected comedic moments provide a welcome break from the intense action sequences. However, the show never loses sight of its core plot, ensuring a satisfyingly thrilling conclusion. The climax, with its high-stakes chase and revelations, is a satisfying conclusion to the story.

However, the series does have its flaws. Some plot points feel rushed, and the romantic subplot could have been explored in more depth. Despite these minor shortcomings, Farzi is a thrilling ride that showcases the strengths of its creators.

Farzi is a thrilling ride that showcases the talents of its creators and cast. It's a series that will keep you hooked from start to finish. While it may not be a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's definitely a standout in the crowded landscape of Indian web series."
The Goop Lab,I enjoyed it!!,"This was fun! The story was...nothing mind-blowing, but how it was told, the writing along with the performances made it worth the binge.

The acting first - Shahid Kapoor has, IMO, not really received the props that he deserves. His work shines through he plays this gray shade and this show gives him a chance to do that.

I'm of the opinion that Vijay Sethupathi plays all his roles the same way which, for me, takes away the fun out of his characters. This, also done the same way, however was very enjoyable because I've never seen him speak in Hindi. S/O whomever wrote the dialogues for Michael Vedanayagam, the 'nakkal' in Hindi just hits different. You've gotta watch it to see what I mean.

The supporting cast on this show was really good as well. Raashi Khanna was given a good role, well written, impactful on the storyline - unlike some of the movie roles I've seen her do. Kay Kay Menon - pay close attention to his eyes and eyebrows in the context of his dialogue deliveries - I was fascinated by the quirks that he brought to the role. Bhuvan Arora did a great job along with Shahid. Acting highlight in show - Zakir Hussain as Minister Gahlot was epic and his chemistry with Vijay Sethupathi was HILARIOUS.

The show does have some plot conveniences that made me roll my eyes briefly and I wish it had more 'intense' moments, but that's just me nitpicking.

Blink and you'll miss the Raj & DK universe. Prime universe? What are we calling it? Very eager to see where this goes. Very eager to see if they do a spin-off about Michael Vedanayagam.

Would def watch Season 02, and I think you will enjoy this as well."
The Goop Lab,"Counterfeit masterpiece web series thriller, with adrenaline rush one can witness on OTT","Farzi- Counterfeit masterpiece web series thriller, with adrenaline rush one can witness on OTT.

Stellar ensemble cast that shines bright and sparkle during the cat and mouse chase.

Shahid kapoor performs one of his career best and the coolest role until the boiler plate bursts. Bhavan Arora supports him well as a tree root with utmost honesty.

Kay Kay Menon is at his usual best as a wicked villain who has no bounds.

Vijay Sethupathi brings his A game with witty dialogues and calm thinking/expressions.

His encounter with minister Zakir Hussain is hilarious and paisa vasool worthy scenes. Raashi Khanna and rest of the cast has given their best.

Director has picked an uncommon plot, taken it at a grand scale, with quirky comedy and family bonding, followed by greed, revenge, intelligent mind games and tensed chase.

Every role has been itched with lots of thinking and care.

Farzi shows ""Apna Marzi"" in a daring, edgy with a smart twist.

Enjoy it on Amazon Prime with popcorn and favorite drink this weekend!"
The Goop Lab,Stretched unnecessarily,"Farzi is unlike earlier Raj and DK famous series The Family Man which in both the season not looked boring or stretched but this looked like an effort to unnecessarily took the narrative to the next season.

Even if they want second series this should be fast paced and can be end in 5 or 6 episodes. Apart from length the series has an amazing story-line, good dialogues and awesome performances specially Bhuvan Arora and Kay Kay Menon. Shahid Kapoor,Vijay Sethupati,Rashi Khanna, Amol Palekar all reprise their role nicely.

I hope to watch more thrill,more twists - turns and fun in the next season."
The Goop Lab,SUPER NOTE by RAJ AND DK,"A gripping crime drama by Raj and Dk. The makers showcased all the characters. The writers left us with good suspenseful ending leaving us waiting for next season. The Plot was set clearly on counterfeiting scams which the writers has executed perfectly. The actors has done their roles perfectly. Sunny(Shahid Kapoor)and Firoz (Bhuvan Arora)bromance,Sunny-Megha(Raashi Khanna) on Screen chemistry worked. Michael Vedanayagam( Vijay Setupathi) has done an excellent work with his timing and mannerisms. Mansoor Dalal (Kay Kay Menon) has done his part with comedy-serious Character. The makers couldn't get a better screen presence for Regina Cassandra And Kubbra Sait,could have great presence in next season. There are some reference connecting The Family Man series. Overall,a great watch.."
The Goop Lab,Falls short of Family Man standards,"Good story, excellent acting. But quite a few flaws in script and direction. Especially the last episode. Placed in 2021 it looks idiotic that law enforcement could not seal the parking lot of a mall. It is also unbelievable that phones of investigating officers are not sanitized. The initial raid in Nepal also appeared amateurish with security walking into hotel with no lookouts from the criminal's bodyguards. The overall script and storyline is great. The detailing of the crime is excellent as is the hallmark of earlier DK Raj production. Do not get mislead by the first 30 mts of first episode. The web series starts slow but then picks up a consistent pace."

The Goop Lab,That was a great Series,"Vijay sethupathi is too good and hella natural actor all time favorite 💙 what a series ended at a very good note.. Shahid kapoor is good as well whole casting is done brilliantly there is no bgm though like scam but here and there feels like its a scam lookalike Acting dialogue story everything is top notch K K menon is too good funny thing is i thought he is biggest villain but hella no upper hand on him is going to reveal in second part special mention Sethupathi dialogues in hindi were done brilliantly The only problem i have with multiple series are nudity and foul language as it cant be watchable with family thank god nudity isnt there in this one but language is very obscene its a request if makers can make any clean crime thriller series waiting for the one 👍🏻👍🏻 This is something you cannot miss if you want to watch powerful acting, thrilling story Their biggest victory as a story teller lies in the fact that you are relating to the journey of two protagonists like you just cant stop yourself supporting the bad guy you want him to win because you have seen his good side as well and there are times when you don't want the characters to take a certain decision Farzi isn't just a cat and mouse race between the characters but also their actors to be at their best Shahid kapoor suits very well in the roles of criminal and romantic hero genre movies or series Kay Kay Menon as Mansoor too gets his moments to shine but the best as an actor is kept for the finale I didnt want series to end its that gripping

Cant wait for next season Veteran actor Amol Palekar and Bhuvan Arora all are good but Vijay Sethupathi has absolutely nailed in few scenes his Comic timing is so good that one watching will laugh out loud have a habit of fast forwarding scenes but I tell you every single minute here counts.. I had to rewind those 5 - 10 seconds which I missed Raj & DK outdo themselves with this original crime caper. Outstanding storytelling. A dream cast of Shahid Kapoor, Vijay Sethupathi and Kay Kay Menon at the top of their game. Brilliant performances by a terrific ensemble Just watch it, and I bet you can't leave your couch without finishing all the episodes you will fall in love with the character in the movie. You will end up watching in one day because of story acting production."
The Tour,One final journey for the road,"I will not spoil anything for anyone other than - the final swansong for these amazing guys was without a shadow of doubt the absolute best episode of the lot. If you have anything harsh or nasty to say about this show and the 3 guys who have entertained us for 22 years - keep it to yourself. We should be thankful that we had them at all. Jeremy, Richard and of course James - Thank you for sharing your adventures with us and for all the times you made us laugh, cry, upset, jump for joy, LOL and so on these will be precious memories that shall not ever fade from our hearts. The Grand Tour team was one of a kind and what a way to end the journey!"
The Tour,Season 3 Special Episode is the funniest show I have seen in years...,"Their connection with each other as they travelled across Mongolia was wonderful to watch. Hammond's attempts at driving were always great and perfectly timed. I have not laughed out loud during a TV show this much in a LONG time!

P.S. Where can I get a ""John""?"
The Tour,Thank you. For everything.,"Brilliant, simply brilliant.

Thank you for everything and thank you for always being there when life sucked. Thank you for creating this.

Thank you for the countless laughs, the unforgettable moments, and the sheer joy of watching three friends explore the world through their love of cars and adventure.

But more than that, thank you for igniting a passion for cars in me, a passion that has grown stronger with every episode. You've shown us that cars are more than just machines-they're a way of life, a connection to something bigger, and a reason to stay curious and engaged with the world. You gave us a way to escape from the dullness of everyday life and offered an alternative to being caught up in distractions that don't matter.

The Grand Tour (and Top Gear) was more than just a show. It was an experience, a companion through tough times, and a reminder of the thrill of discovery. You made us laugh, gasp, and even cry on occasion, and for that, I can't thank you enough. The end of this journey is bittersweet, but the memories you've created will stay with us forever.

Thank you, Clarkson, Hammond, and May, for everything. You've given us something truly special, and for that, we will always be grateful."
The Tour,It's like MEGA BUDGET Top Gear.,"Imagine what would happen if the famous three were told by Amazon to do what they want and spend as much as you like - because clearly that's what happened here and the end result is AWESOME!

Everything is Hollywood in scale and execution. From the writing to the action set pieces, it almost has a slight Michael Bay feel to it.

All three presenters are on top form but Clarkson is clearly still the star.

'So is it basically just like Top Gear?'I hear you say. And the answer is 'yes', but imagine Top Gear better than it's ever been. The only negative is no Stig. There is Stig-like replacement but it's just not the same.

Otherwise, this show is off to an AMAZING start. Highly recommended."
The Tour,Classic,"The brand was not so much the name of the previous show... The brand is this lot here making the best motoring show ever. Well done for Amazon who quickly managed to get them on board.

Without any spoilers: It is exciting, it feels familiar - yet new. Thrilling might be right word, but again - even if you sit these three around a table and let them talk about cats for an hour - they'll surely deliver.

I think what most viewers would be hoping for is a fair dose of craziness, but also exploring new heights.

I am not being objective, but yet again, who is? If you loved TG then you'll love GT....

Looking forward to seeing the trio do excitingly new challenges!"
The Tour,Grand Tour has delivered the goods!,"So there was nothing to worry about after all! After the kerfuffle surrounding the end of the three presenting TG at the Beeb, I honestly thought that wherever they went nothing would be the same again in the motor show universe.

Well I am happy to report here that I was wrong, sorry let me write that again properly. I was WRONG! Yep it needed the capitals.

Amazon threw a lot of money at GT, probably 10 times the budget that TG enjoyed and today there must be some very happy execs in that organisation. The show is at once familiar and different, Richard Hammond's boyish charm (my wife is happy), James May's nerdy appeal and Jezza's sardonic take on everything - all is as it was, but there is also an excitement to GT that TG lacked, a production value that exceeds anything that has gone before as far as a magazine show is concerned.

I'm not going to go into any details, no spoilers here, but the whole show is spectacular, great cars, great music, great scenery and most importantly of all - great presenters. If you liked TG you are going to love GT!"
The Tour,"Ending it, together","I've now joined the trio for almost a decade in both adventures, car reviews and on stage. We've laughed, been annoyed, intrigued and so much more, together. I've been there, with them, all along. Yet, it was not physical closeness, it was emotional and spiritual. The Grand Tour and Top Gear before it had the ability to draw one in like no other program. I feel like I know the trio as well as they know each other despite never meeting them. It is truly an end of an era. One that sculpted much of my adolescent life and beyond.

I like cars, I like driving, and I can't think that it has spawned anywhere else but with Top Gear and The Grand Tour.

It is probably wrong to write about both programmes here, but the constant between them, the thing that makes us all watch, is that trio.

Yes, The Grand Tour has had its misses, quite a few of them, but the feeling you get, joining them in an adventure you could only ever dream of, is simply extraordinary.

I am sad that it had to come to an end. But know, as this programme is slowly fading into a memory, we have the possibility to think back, laugh and enjoy the moments we've all had together as an audience and the Trio. We can feel the exact same type of bittersweetness, that they feel themselves, because after all, isn't that exactly what it was all about?"
The Tour,Second season saves!,"Yeah, first season left me a bit dissapointed. The first episode in general was really good and there where signs of hope along the tour of season 1 but in the end it just felt too scripted. And it seems they heard it, just look at the episode unscripted, it seems they really took the criticsm to heart.

Second season is full of all the stuff that i loved in Top Gear. Its fun, fast, slightly ridiculous, some times scary but really really just great entertainement. Love it, keep it up!"
The Tour,The boys are back!,"At last - Clarkson, Hammond and May are back on our screens, and they're better than ever. Considering Amazon's budget dwarfs that of the BBC, you can imagine just how impressive their new show is.

If the first episode is anything to go by, they have successfully managed to retain everything that was good about the old Top Gear in 'The Grand Tour', especially the humour and the chemistry between the three which made the old show the success it was. My biggest fear was that the new show would lose this and become too 'Americanised', but fortunately this hasn't happened.

The camera work is phenomenal and the opening sequence was like something out of a movie. I also think the idea to take the show on the road is a nice touch. An incredible start - I already can't wait for next week's episode."
The Tour,They're Back!,"It's amazing how well the trio slips right back into top form in the first episode of the Grand Tour. I loved the first episode, and I wish I could watch the rest of the season right now. This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values. They even have some excellent CGI showing how each hybrid engine works.

The only things missing from Top Gear are the Stig, and the celebrity interviews. While this eliminates some of the excellent Stig jokes, they've replaced him with a named racer to perform time trials on their crazy new track. For the celebrities, they had a funny series of jokes about it, but honestly there's not much to miss.

So overall, I'd recommend this show to everyone, but especially fans of humor, cars, and travel. I think I might have a new favorite TV show with The Grand Tour, and I can't wait to see the rest of the season."
The Tour,"Like Top Gear, but fun","Watching The Gran Tour, i see the same quality in the motoring sections as Top Gear had in their very best episodes; the visuals, editing, audio, are as good as if not better than before. The parts in between - comedy parts where the three leads chat and entertain the audience - are funnier than they used to be. The clear culprit here is the change of scenery for Hammond, Clarkson and May, who look refreshed and happy to be doing what they do. The fun is infectious and i feel like i'm having fun with them.

I would actually say this is better, in everything, than Top Gear. ""Old"" Top Gear, not the new clone TV show that the BBC is trying to keep afloat.

Would i recommend The Grand Tour? Heck yeah. Amazon prime is not free, and unless you use Amazon, you might have not much use for it, and it could be money badly spent on only one TV show.

But if you do have Prime, or if one of your friends has it and you can go over and watch it there, then The Grand Tour is unmissable, one of the best TV shows worldwide.

9/10 - possibly the best TV show without a story script."
The Tour,The only car show I watch,"I'm not a grease monkey, never dreamed I would watch a car show, but have watched every episode of the grand tour, and am sad that it's coming to an end.

I do appreciate a nice car when I see one and go for a ride in them whenever I have the chance, which is not often. Wouldn't even go to a car show.

Learned a lot about cars but most of all loved the way the host interact with each other and the difference in their personality.

The Tour,Getting better with time!,"After a steady start with Seasons 1 & 2, the 3rd has really excelled in my opinion.

The features and specials are great, the humour is more natural and most of all it's great fun to watch!! The chemistry and banter between the 3 of them is much more evident in this latest instalment too.

It's worth noting that I did very much enjoy the first 2 seasons but I felt the show was still finding it's feet in terms of the format and what felt like over scripting at times.

Overall I love the show. I watched Top Gear with the 3 of them religiously and I love that The Grand Tour is here to fill the void!"
The Tour,(If you really are open to other views) The chemistry has been forced to death.,"If you really are open to other views: I watched Top Gear since the 2002 reboot, and the two most fun elements were the specials and the chemistry between the believable characters.

But when they realized this, they gradually tried to force it, resulting in it becoming more and more over the top. And in the end it just stopped being believable. Which means it stopped being fun.

In The Grand Tour, they desperately tried to re-ignite that chemistry. (Jeremy says so himself.) But by now it has completely stopped being natural and believable, and is more like someone badly copying a caricature of a nostalgic memory. And all that's left is them looking like they're trying too hard. That's just not fun anymore. And that makes me disappointed and sad.

The other problem that I have is that, given their apparently much bigger budget, having each episode be a special and then some would have been possible. But they just went on doing basically the old format. Which is rather wasteful, financially.

Well, at least their mini-specials each episodes give a bit of joy. I still have hope. I'm just rather disappointed."

Clarkson, Hammond and May come back with this refreshing look and take on a car show. The backdrops to each episode look stunning and the guys are on a better form then they ever have been. I'm glad they left the BBC because it gave them time to create something new that was not going to dry out and become dull and also gave us time to get ready for something that will change the way TV is made.

The Tour,Wow! Sublime! Perfect! Provocative!,"I just watched an impressive, thoughtful, provocative, memorable, perfect first episode of the first season.

I was not sure what to expect with the trio's new take on what they love to do the most. Actually it was imaginative and provocative enough to show that these three can come come up with the most watchable car programme on earth.

The cinematography was better than anything I have seen before. Even better than the show they left behind at the 'Baa Baa See'! :)

The picture quality was astounding. Whatever cameras and jigs they have used to film the show are probably the best equipment available. The overall visuals look spectacular and 'grand'. Smooth Amazon Prime streaming in proper HD gets credit for that too. Vibrant colours, smooth camera work and not the shaky vibrating car mounted cameras of yore. - Even in this department, it appears as though BBC has been beaten! Even the sound recording felt better. Now, sound recording is something BBC (Baa Baa See) used to excel in. Now, with an iPlayer that does not appear to play full HD and with a sound that feels compressed, Baa Baa See has unwittingly given these three guys an edge over their own sorry show. The audio playback was really superlative in Amazon Prime for what I was expecting for a streaming playback.

Something dreary like a motoring show becomes so exciting with these three. I was completely expecting a few laugh out loud moments. What was actually there exceeded all expectations. I would expect more fun and more laugh out loud moments. I am totally spoilt. Would imagine that eventually, there will be scenes and episodes that sets new heights and standards. Is this a stunt show? Is this a motoring show? Is this a sitcom? Who knows. It is superlative fun: - That is what it is . I cannot wait to watch the rest of the season, as it looks like each episode may have its own unique flavour, because of the changing locations. Wow! Brilliant!

****Just this one show alone makes my Amazon Prime membership worth it****

I have watched more episodes since this review and wanted to report back. Yes, this show is definitely mega fun and it looks like it has been a game changer for Amazon. I would now expect Amazon to throw even more money at not just Grand Tour, but to other potential programming. One the whole I am extremely pleased with Amazon streaming quality. After this, BBC's old version of Top Gear is probably dead. I still like BBC drama as they are more quintessentially British compared to current content on Amazon.

The Tour,A Fitting End,"""Oh cock"" it's over.

What a way to cap 22 years of televisual brilliance. Over half of my lifetime there has been a constant TV institution that these three men and their teams have sculpted.

From the humblest beginnings in season 1 of Top Gear (the reboot), to that microphone unplug at the end of The Grand Tour, I've loved every minute.

Not often does TV interest me enough to capture my attention for more than a few seasons, and often programmes can run well passed their best, but this just works. Even when I can see the reality of the dramatisation, I still buy into the story and 'will' them to the end. They create a narrative that elevates the simple 'car magazine show' to something that makes you feel like you were there, as part of the journey and a passenger. I 'feel' like I know them and for that they will be sorely missed.

They deserve the 'Attenborough-esque' opportunity to make what they can until they can't. Tremendous, poignant and hilarious. Thank you."
The Tour,Thank You for the Love of Cars and the World,"I started watching Top Gear when I was still living in Kyiv, Ukraine. I can't remember exactly how old I was, but I know I was very young. I watched all the episodes online, always searching for new ones and waiting eagerly for their release. Watching your shows sparked my love for cars from an early age. Each of you brought something unique: you were funny, resourceful, full of life, and it was always a joy to follow your journeys.

Beyond a love for cars, you gave me a love for the world and for travel. Through your shows, I didn't just see cars; I saw our planet - not just popular tourist spots, but the quiet, beautiful places where people simply live. You showed us places that don't often make it to the screen, yet they are incredibly beautiful. This taught me to love not only cars but also the diversity of our world.

When you left Top Gear, it was a loss for me. I didn't know what else could compare to your show. I searched for news, hoping you'd create something new. Then, when I found out about The Grand Tour, I felt relieved and began waiting for the first episodes. My English wasn't great back then, so I had to wait for translations into my language. Now, I live in the United States. I have a son, and I'm passing on to him the love for cars and exploration that you inspired in me.

Thank you, Jeremy, for your boldness and unfiltered humor that always kept things real. Thank you, Richard, for your adventurous spirit and boundless enthusiasm that brought so much energy to every journey. Thank you, James, for your calm and thoughtful approach that balanced the chaos and reminded us of the joy in the details.

Thank you all for your hard work, for my joyful childhood filled with your shows. I hope to see you on screen again someday."
The Tour,Grand,"After the end of an era and a long period of uncertainty and waiting, 507 days to be exact, we are presented with what can only be described as utter brilliance and pure enjoyment, something that is truly worth the wait, welcome everyone...to The Grand Tour.

A refreshing, semi-automotive program packed with action and excitement, introduced in the most magnificent way possible. After watching the first episode, you sense that you have just witnessed the beginning of a new era, one that stands on more than just the exceptional chemistry of the trio, but on the refined genius of the brand new show as well. The Grand Tour is truly everything one expects it to be; grand in every way."
The Tour,'The grand is an unique show and can not be compared to the old Top Gear',"The Grand Tour Season 1

The Grand Tour is a rather nice show. They kept most of Top Gear's concepts in the program but gave them a new touch, which makes this a completely different show. However, is it any better than the old Top Gear where Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May still used to work with the BBC? This has been the first year that the trio has been working together with Amazon. The team was less experienced and so it was hard to make the show perfect. Still, Amazon gave the guys more freedom than BBC ever had given and so they made a brilliant show. Not only is the Grand Tour a funny and informative show, but a very beautiful one too. Every episode they present in a different places which makes you see a lot of sights and culture every time you watch an episode.

Anyway from my point of view this show is a very unique one and can not be compared to the old Top Gear. They are both nice programs and special in their own way and so one can not be called better than the other. The Grand Tour contains some scenes which are obviously faked to make the show more funny, and I am not sure if I like that. Top gear sometimes became a bit boring so I would lose my focus. So they both have their flaws and are not perfect shows. I am curious to see what Amazon does with Grand Tour season 2 since they are now more experienced than last year."
The Tour,"On par with golden age Top Gear, except for two annoyances...","Not long ago on a television network not far away called the BBC, Top Gear was revamped from its old informative editorial format into a weird comedy/talk show/reality/documentary. By season 2 the show settled on their starring lineup: Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond, three very British and somewhat incompetent automotive journalists who reviewed the latest models, revisited classics, discussed automotive news, and interviewed celebrities in their own unique way, Most amusing of all were their challenges, road trips, and hair-brained schemes to apply their automotive knowledge and passion to make life easier and the world a better place (often with disastrous results).

Top Gear worked so well in this format because of the chemistry between the three presenters. They were genuinely organic and funny, contrasted with the cringe-inducing subsequent hosts. When Jeremy was fired in 2015, James and Richard stuck to their guns and resigned as well, knowing all three of them are what contributed to the show's success. We will never see Top Gear in this format again, but The Grand Tour is just about the best replacement we could've realistically asked for.

It follows the same general format as the old show: reviews, interviews, discussions, challenges, and adventures. It's the same 3 presenters, but this time (for the first 3 seasons anyway) each episode is filmed at a different location in the world. My first annoyance with this, is that because they're following the old format so closely, and they can't use the same titles and lingo from Top Gear, the replacements are so transparent. Instead of The Stig they had The American who was soon replaced with Abby. The Stig was a huge part of Top Gear's identity. Granted he was more of a prop than a character, but his anonymity and socially removed behavior allowed for some great gags. Jeremy now says ""terrible disappointment"" and ""back to the tent"" instead of ""bombshell"" and ""back to the studio"". Conversation street is clearly just the news, but at least Richard gives a unique intro every time and the animated shorts are hilarious.

My second, bigger gripe with the Grand Tour is how some parts are a lot more obviously staged than in Top Gear. TG had many staged scenes, but the show somehow managed to make all the dialogue, actions, and body language feel natural. It's hard to explain without spoiling many scenes in GT, but the dialogue feels noticeably more scripted and the events more convoluted.

Many fans are sad that the show (for the time being) will not be continuing in its old format with the tent. I however look forward to season 4 since it will be entirely adventures, which were always the high point of any season of TG or GT. The Grand Tour is not really about the cars anyway. Everything Top Gear has done season 23 and on is proof of that. Jeremy, Hamster, and Captain Slow are the heart of GT, specifically their humor, unbreakable optimism, and sense of adventure. Though there are minor annoyances with the shows presentation, I love how the spirit of Top Gear was still successfully carried over."
The Tour,Not as good as Top Gear was,"As a big fan of the trio and the work they did on Top Gear I have been looking forward to this show for quite some time now. Matter of fact is Top Gear has always been my all time favorite TV show all categories, and my expectations for The Grand Tour was high.

What they did so well in Top Gear however seems to have been lost along the way. The unscripted feel of Top Gear was in my opinion its greatest feet. In TGT however the script is ever so present and the banter among the trio which made Top Gear so good is gone. I can't nothing but hope they will find their way back to the things that made Top Gear so very good.

With that said it is still a very entertaining show, just not as good as Top Gear was. That it has (when I'm writing this) 9,6 on IMDb in its current form is beyond me. I attribute it to the many fans of Jeremy, Hammon and May."

Auntie Faransa,One final journey for the road,"I will not spoil anything for anyone other than - the final swansong for these amazing guys was without a shadow of doubt the absolute best episode of the lot. If you have anything harsh or nasty to say about this show and the 3 guys who have entertained us for 22 years - keep it to yourself. We should be thankful that we had them at all. Jeremy, Richard and of course James - Thank you for sharing your adventures with us and for all the times you made us laugh, cry, upset, jump for joy, LOL and so on these will be precious memories that shall not ever fade from our hearts. The Grand Tour team was one of a kind and what a way to end the journey!"
Auntie Faransa,Season 3 Special Episode is the funniest show I have seen in years...,"Their connection with each other as they travelled across Mongolia was wonderful to watch. Hammond's attempts at driving were always great and perfectly timed. I have not laughed out loud during a TV show this much in a LONG time!

P.S. Where can I get a ""John""?"
Auntie Faransa,Thank you. For everything.,"Brilliant, simply brilliant.

Thank you for everything and thank you for always being there when life sucked. Thank you for creating this.

Thank you for the countless laughs, the unforgettable moments, and the sheer joy of watching three friends explore the world through their love of cars and adventure.

But more than that, thank you for igniting a passion for cars in me, a passion that has grown stronger with every episode. You've shown us that cars are more than just machines-they're a way of life, a connection to something bigger, and a reason to stay curious and engaged with the world. You gave us a way to escape from the dullness of everyday life and offered an alternative to being caught up in distractions that don't matter.

The Grand Tour (and Top Gear) was more than just a show. It was an experience, a companion through tough times, and a reminder of the thrill of discovery. You made us laugh, gasp, and even cry on occasion, and for that, I can't thank you enough. The end of this journey is bittersweet, but the memories you've created will stay with us forever.

Thank you, Clarkson, Hammond, and May, for everything. You've given us something truly special, and for that, we will always be grateful."
Auntie Faransa,It's like MEGA BUDGET Top Gear.,"Imagine what would happen if the famous three were told by Amazon to do what they want and spend as much as you like - because clearly that's what happened here and the end result is AWESOME!

Everything is Hollywood in scale and execution. From the writing to the action set pieces, it almost has a slight Michael Bay feel to it.

All three presenters are on top form but Clarkson is clearly still the star.

'So is it basically just like Top Gear?'I hear you say. And the answer is 'yes', but imagine Top Gear better than it's ever been. The only negative is no Stig. There is Stig-like replacement but it's just not the same.

Otherwise, this show is off to an AMAZING start. Highly recommended."
Auntie Faransa,Classic,"The brand was not so much the name of the previous show... The brand is this lot here making the best motoring show ever. Well done for Amazon who quickly managed to get them on board.

Without any spoilers: It is exciting, it feels familiar - yet new. Thrilling might be right word, but again - even if you sit these three around a table and let them talk about cats for an hour - they'll surely deliver.

I think what most viewers would be hoping for is a fair dose of craziness, but also exploring new heights.

I am not being objective, but yet again, who is? If you loved TG then you'll love GT....

Looking forward to seeing the trio do excitingly new challenges!"
Auntie Faransa,Grand Tour has delivered the goods!,"So there was nothing to worry about after all! After the kerfuffle surrounding the end of the three presenting TG at the Beeb, I honestly thought that wherever they went nothing would be the same again in the motor show universe.

Well I am happy to report here that I was wrong, sorry let me write that again properly. I was WRONG! Yep it needed the capitals.

Amazon threw a lot of money at GT, probably 10 times the budget that TG enjoyed and today there must be some very happy execs in that organisation. The show is at once familiar and different, Richard Hammond's boyish charm (my wife is happy), James May's nerdy appeal and Jezza's sardonic take on everything - all is as it was, but there is also an excitement to GT that TG lacked, a production value that exceeds anything that has gone before as far as a magazine show is concerned.

I'm not going to go into any details, no spoilers here, but the whole show is spectacular, great cars, great music, great scenery and most importantly of all - great presenters. If you liked TG you are going to love GT!"
Auntie Faransa,"Ending it, together","I've now joined the trio for almost a decade in both adventures, car reviews and on stage. We've laughed, been annoyed, intrigued and so much more, together. I've been there, with them, all along. Yet, it was not physical closeness, it was emotional and spiritual. The Grand Tour and Top Gear before it had the ability to draw one in like no other program. I feel like I know the trio as well as they know each other despite never meeting them. It is truly an end of an era. One that sculpted much of my adolescent life and beyond.

I like cars, I like driving, and I can't think that it has spawned anywhere else but with Top Gear and The Grand Tour.

It is probably wrong to write about both programmes here, but the constant between them, the thing that makes us all watch, is that trio.

Yes, The Grand Tour has had its misses, quite a few of them, but the feeling you get, joining them in an adventure you could only ever dream of, is simply extraordinary.

I am sad that it had to come to an end. But know, as this programme is slowly fading into a memory, we have the possibility to think back, laugh and enjoy the moments we've all had together as an audience and the Trio. We can feel the exact same type of bittersweetness, that they feel themselves, because after all, isn't that exactly what it was all about?"
Auntie Faransa,Second season saves!,"Yeah, first season left me a bit dissapointed. The first episode in general was really good and there where signs of hope along the tour of season 1 but in the end it just felt too scripted. And it seems they heard it, just look at the episode unscripted, it seems they really took the criticsm to heart.

Second season is full of all the stuff that i loved in Top Gear. Its fun, fast, slightly ridiculous, some times scary but really really just great entertainement. Love it, keep it up!"
Auntie Faransa,The boys are back!,"At last - Clarkson, Hammond and May are back on our screens, and they're better than ever. Considering Amazon's budget dwarfs that of the BBC, you can imagine just how impressive their new show is.

If the first episode is anything to go by, they have successfully managed to retain everything that was good about the old Top Gear in 'The Grand Tour', especially the humour and the chemistry between the three which made the old show the success it was. My biggest fear was that the new show would lose this and become too 'Americanised', but fortunately this hasn't happened.

The camera work is phenomenal and the opening sequence was like something out of a movie. I also think the idea to take the show on the road is a nice touch. An incredible start - I already can't wait for next week's episode."
Auntie Faransa,They're Back!,"It's amazing how well the trio slips right back into top form in the first episode of the Grand Tour. I loved the first episode, and I wish I could watch the rest of the season right now. This show is funnier than most of the comedies on TV, and it has to be one of the most gorgeous shows on TV, as they really spared no expense on the production values. They even have some excellent CGI showing how each hybrid engine works.

The only things missing from Top Gear are the Stig, and the celebrity interviews. While this eliminates some of the excellent Stig jokes, they've replaced him with a named racer to perform time trials on their crazy new track. For the celebrities, they had a funny series of jokes about it, but honestly there's not much to miss.

So overall, I'd recommend this show to everyone, but especially fans of humor, cars, and travel. I think I might have a new favorite TV show with The Grand Tour, and I can't wait to see the rest of the season."
Auntie Faransa,"Like Top Gear, but fun","Watching The Gran Tour, i see the same quality in the motoring sections as Top Gear had in their very best episodes; the visuals, editing, audio, are as good as if not better than before. The parts in between - comedy parts where the three leads chat and entertain the audience - are funnier than they used to be. The clear culprit here is the change of scenery for Hammond, Clarkson and May, who look refreshed and happy to be doing what they do. The fun is infectious and i feel like i'm having fun with them.

I would actually say this is better, in everything, than Top Gear. ""Old"" Top Gear, not the new clone TV show that the BBC is trying to keep afloat.

Would i recommend The Grand Tour? Heck yeah. Amazon prime is not free, and unless you use Amazon, you might have not much use for it, and it could be money badly spent on only one TV show.

But if you do have Prime, or if one of your friends has it and you can go over and watch it there, then The Grand Tour is unmissable, one of the best TV shows worldwide.

9/10 - possibly the best TV show without a story script."
Auntie Faransa,The only car show I watch,"I'm not a grease monkey, never dreamed I would watch a car show, but have watched every episode of the grand tour, and am sad that it's coming to an end.

I do appreciate a nice car when I see one and go for a ride in them whenever I have the chance, which is not often. Wouldn't even go to a car show.

Learned a lot about cars but most of all loved the way the host interact with each other and the difference in their personality. I've tried watching other shows with each host but like all three together as they balance each other out. Most of all Richard's choice of vehicles always made me smile."

After watching the first episode, you sense that you have just witnessed the beginning of a new era, one that stands on more than just the exceptional chemistry of the trio, but on the refined genius of the brand new show as well. The Grand Tour is truly everything one expects it to be; grand in every way."
Auntie Faransa,'The grand is an unique show and can not be compared to the old Top Gear',"The Grand Tour Season 1

The Grand Tour is a rather nice show. They kept most of Top Gear's concepts in the program but gave them a new touch, which makes this a completely different show. However, is it any better than the old Top Gear where Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May still used to work with the BBC? This has been the first year that the trio has been working together with Amazon. The team was less experienced and so it was hard to make the show perfect. Still, Amazon gave the guys more freedom than BBC ever had given and so they made a brilliant show. Not only is the Grand Tour a funny and informative show, but a very beautiful one too. Every episode they present in a different places which makes you see a lot of sights and culture every time you watch an episode.

Anyway from my point of view this show is a very unique one and can not be compared to the old Top Gear. They are both nice programs and special in their own way and so one can not be called better than the other. The Grand Tour contains some scenes which are obviously faked to make the show more funny, and I am not sure if I like that. Top gear sometimes became a bit boring so I would lose my focus. So they both have their flaws and are not perfect shows. I am curious to see what Amazon does with Grand Tour season 2 since they are now more experienced than last year."
Auntie Faransa,"On par with golden age Top Gear, except for two annoyances...","Not long ago on a television network not far away called the BBC, Top Gear was revamped from its old informative editorial format into a weird comedy/talk show/reality/documentary. By season 2 the show settled on their starring lineup: Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond, three very British and somewhat incompetent automotive journalists who reviewed the latest models, revisited classics, discussed automotive news, and interviewed celebrities in their own unique way, Most amusing of all were their challenges, road trips, and hair-brained schemes to apply their automotive knowledge and passion to make life easier and the world a better place (often with disastrous results).

Top Gear worked so well in this format because of the chemistry between the three presenters. They were genuinely organic and funny, contrasted with the cringe-inducing subsequent hosts. When Jeremy was fired in 2015, James and Richard stuck to their guns and resigned as well, knowing all three of them are what contributed to the show's success. We will never see Top Gear in this format again, but The Grand Tour is just about the best replacement we could've realistically asked for.

It follows the same general format as the old show: reviews, interviews, discussions, challenges, and adventures. It's the same 3 presenters, but this time (for the first 3 seasons anyway) each episode is filmed at a different location in the world. My first annoyance with this, is that because they're following the old format so closely, and they can't use the same titles and lingo from Top Gear, the replacements are so transparent. Instead of The Stig they had The American who was soon replaced with Abby. The Stig was a huge part of Top Gear's identity. Granted he was more of a prop than a character, but his anonymity and socially removed behavior allowed for some great gags. Jeremy now says ""terrible disappointment"" and ""back to the tent"" instead of ""bombshell"" and ""back to the studio"". Conversation street is clearly just the news, but at least Richard gives a unique intro every time and the animated shorts are hilarious.

My second, bigger gripe with the Grand Tour is how some parts are a lot more obviously staged than in Top Gear. TG had many staged scenes, but the show somehow managed to make all the dialogue, actions, and body language feel natural. It's hard to explain without spoiling many scenes in GT, but the dialogue feels noticeably more scripted and the events more convoluted.

Many fans are sad that the show (for the time being) will not be continuing in its old format with the tent. I however look forward to season 4 since it will be entirely adventures, which were always the high point of any season of TG or GT. The Grand Tour is not really about the cars anyway. Everything Top Gear has done season 23 and on is proof of that. Jeremy, Hamster, and Captain Slow are the heart of GT, specifically their humor, unbreakable optimism, and sense of adventure. Though there are minor annoyances with the shows presentation, I love how the spirit of Top Gear was still successfully carried over."
Auntie Faransa,Not as good as Top Gear was,"As a big fan of the trio and the work they did on Top Gear I have been looking forward to this show for quite some time now. Matter of fact is Top Gear has always been my all time favorite TV show all categories, and my expectations for The Grand Tour was high.

What they did so well in Top Gear however seems to have been lost along the way. The unscripted feel of Top Gear was in my opinion its greatest feet. In TGT however the script is ever so present and the banter among the trio which made Top Gear so good is gone. I can't nothing but hope they will find their way back to the things that made Top Gear so very good.

With that said it is still a very entertaining show, just not as good as Top Gear was. That it has (when I'm writing this) 9,6 on IMDb in its current form is beyond me. I attribute it to the many fans of Jeremy, Hammon and May."

Nadiya Bakes,Funny and professional,"I really enjoyed watching Nadyia Bakes, her way to present the program was excellent. Hope Netflix repeat this program with another season."
Nadiya Bakes,Fun,"A fun and lighthearted baking show hosted by the charming GBBO alum Nadiya. The bakes looked great and she gave good directions and quick tips. Could have done without the baker spotlights, they didn't add much."
Nadiya Bakes,Sticky Sweet Comfort Food,"Even though she was my hero in Bake Off and in many ways the Greatest Living Human I'd sort of avoided most of Nadiya's BBC output. She's been awkwardly crowbarred into the identikit chef model where in reality she's nothing of the sort. Therefore her often quite whacky recipes seem oddly out of place in the light and spacious model kitchen, cooking over the ""Greatest Inoffensive TV Background Music Hits of the Early 00s"". It all feels rather stiff and safe, when the great joy in watching Nadiya is her effusive joy and honest reactions.

In the defense of the production team there is a pandemic on - so the slightly awkward ""cut to professional chef doing what amounts to a short promo vid"" was likely meant to be a cooking guest spot and the (by the end of the series) forced ""let's all get the crew to have some food finale"" bits make the whole thing seem off-balanced. I mean - it's a cooking show with Nadiya, you get to see her bake stuff and grin happily, there's a camera in the oven which is quite cool. It does the job essentially.

What I sort of hope is that she gets even more of an identity - she's done ""travelcook"" shows before and they always work much better than this. There's another in the pipeline but... you know. Circumstances. The most important thing is that she's happy and baking on the Beeb - I still remember being overjoyed with happiness when she won Bake Off and her having this career at all is utterly magnificent."
Nadiya Bakes,She's a sweet treat .,Nadiya makes me want to bake period. Her show makes me feel like I can not only are her recipes are easy to follow. She's a sweet treat that will make you smile with delicious foods.
Nadiya Bakes,Everything a Baking show should be,"I rooted for Nadiya when she was on the Great British Baking Show and I was delighted that Netflix gave her not one, but two shows. I watched an episode of Time to Cook, but I find that I like to watch baking better. Nadiya is fun, sweet, energetic and makes some tempting looking bakes. I already have plans to make her strawberry shortcake cupcakes. The editing, color and videography are to be commended as well. Nadiya is a lovely host and very relatable and down to earth. A great watch all around."
Nadiya Bakes,Therapy in a show,"Nadiya's joy is palpable while she's in her element. It's a pleasure to watch. During these tough times for the world, it's such a sunny, happy, soothing show to watch of someone whose passion and excitement is contagious. I'm not sure what the negative reviewer's expectation was; after all it's called ""Nadiya Bakes,"" not ""How to Bake."" The recipes are available if your goal is to learn. Otherwise, I'm content watching this lovely expressive joyful person bake to her heart's content."
Nadiya Bakes,What a charmer,I mean she is a star. Is that enough? No it's not. Well she's better than the cooks they have on the Ametican shows. That's for sure.
Nadiya Bakes,Not a great Show to learn,Showed mostly frozen food - whatta waste! Every dish has frozen food in it. How can one encourage for it?
Nadiya Bakes,Upbeat and accessible,I only wish her recipes were more translatable into American metrics.
Nadiya Bakes,Best cooking show for me,"This is undoubtedly the best cooking show for me. Each episode captivated me, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying every moment. The host is truly on another level, elevating the entire experience with her charming personality. Her presence makes baking not just a culinary delight but a genuinely enjoyable journey. The way she effortlessly weaves motivation into her demonstrations is inspiring; even the laziest person on this earth-myself-felt a newfound enthusiasm. It's not just a cooking show; it's a delightful and uplifting culinary experience. Love love love love love love love love love."
Nadiya Bakes,flavors of life,"Her enthusiasm is the basic ingredient of a show not only, not first about food, dishes, art of cooking but about flavors of life.

The joy to live, this is the precious gift of Nadya Hussain and the source of seduction of each episode. Sure, a reality TV. Special for a sort of fair familiarity , for advices and secrets and for the beautiful dosis of good feeling."

Hotel Transylvania: The Series,"Not completely terrible but also, not great","Very meh show but I can't really find a reason to dislike it all that much. My kid watches it occasionally and because I keep an eye on what he watches, I get a dose of whatever is on :-/ This isn't the worst thing but it's not super inspiring either. The positives are the young cast of voice actors do a nice job and the animation is pretty expressive. The script is typical and same old tired scenarios leave it in the dust when you compare it to Home or even The Croods series. Anyone complaining that these companies just turn EVERYTHING into an animated tv series to squeeze cash should know that when I was a kid, we had animated tv series of not only EVERY Disney movie but also adult films like the Mask and Dumb and Dumber. And they're never in the film canon. They had a pet beaver in Dumb and Dumber. These companies ALWAYS grabbed for cash. At least they don't make toys of the series as much now."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Stop trying to reinvent the wheel,"Once again Disney has a hit with a movie and the proceeds to ruin it by making it into a TV show with low quality animation.

It's OK to spend some of your money in order to produce a quality TV show for children.

Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Very Fun to Watch,"I really liked the take on Mavis' younger years (teen years). The characters were all very well thought out (um, except maybe Klaus(h)), with different personalities that draw them all together. My personal favorite is Aunt Lydia. I also liked that the audience gets to see more of Hotel Transylvania and its workers/guests.... This series took me by surprise-I absolutely enjoy watching it-and I hope to see more on Netflix."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Annoying,"Like all movies converted into a TV-series, this is supposed to happen before the first movie. Dracula only has a few cameos (The best character in the show!), they've added a really annoying slime/blob/nerd character and the main character has a completely different personality from the movie. The animation is just fine, it's not hand drawn and fluid, but flash animated and almost seems like it's missing frames. It just stutters a lot. The main character's design looks like someone from ""Star vs the Forces of Evil"", which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Too much slapstick, which doesn't really work when the animation is so limited and stiff. Horrible jokes too"
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,One of my fav cartoons out there,"Laughing out loud.

Hotel Transylvania the series is funner and zanier than the original source. Love the writing and voice acting. Mavis is great and deserves to be the star. Love how fast she zooms around. This voice actor has way more energy than Selena Gomez of the movies, who makes Mavis too flat and bland. Mavis in the movies is pretty much a non-character, mopey and charmless. This 'teenage' Mavis is a ball of hilarious.

The 11 minute episode format leaves no room for melodrama and sappy stuff like the movies have. It's just fun. Great cameo characters too like Medusa. Haven't experienced a lot of predictable or stereotypical monster stuff. They have free reign to create lore which is refreshing.

The music is great too with a mix of punk, hip hop, mariachi,etc.

Artwork, animation, cinematography, writing, all tops. Best out there.

Season 2 is just as great as 1! Pretty much my favorite cartoon of the 2000's. And I watch a lot of cartoons. Thank you to the producers of this show"
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Disney Channel needs to get their act together,"Why does everything need a franchise? What is so special about Hotel Transylvania to warrant a sequel and a T.V. series? When I first saw Hotel Transylvania for my fourteenth birthday, I thought that it was pretty fair and Mavis was cringe-worthily foolish as a child. And because I wasn't a big fan of the first film, I didn't know if I wanted to see the sequel.

This series is coming from a company that has never made a great animated film that I've seen from them. I caught the last 20 minutes of the first episode and the whole thing was just clichéd. It had lowbrow humor, a replaced voice cast when the original voice cast were okay, and an again, clichéd plot. I even want to say the animation is mostly bad but it's hard to get used to the new 2.D. animation.

This series doesn't seem to have anything to do with the sequel. Why do I need to know more about Mavis and company? They already showed her as a child, growing up, learning how to fly and I think that's enough."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Why,Why do people make shows of animated movies. It's kinda funny because every tv show remake is so bad that I need to make a new word worse than hate.
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,"This not only doesn't need to exist, it's downright awful.","I saw the trailer for this show long before its first episode aired on TV. I was unimpressed. Still, I hoped it would be one of those cases where the show itself is enjoyable in the least, and different from the trailer. God. It's quite the opposite.

Before I go on I'd like to note that I have to note that I have never seen the original movie(s). I have heard that they are funny and heartwarming, and I do intend to watch them at some point, but I intentionally went into this show with no prior knowledge of the source material. I want to judge this as its own thing, and not some petty addition to an expanding franchise.

Anyway, the show has very little going on for it. You could probably say, actually, that it has nothing going on for it. I can not name a SINGLE time I laughed at this show. All of the jokes either fall flat, are delivered incorrectly, or outright don't make sense. And that is probably one of the biggest flaws, if not THE biggest flaw, of the show. It is straight-up unfunny. The animation does not help in the slightest, either.

The animation looks lazy and, at times, unfinished. It's clearly cheap and done under a very tight time limit. One of the very few things I have heard about the original movie is that its animation style is very fast-paced and compliments the humor very nicely. That is NOT the case here. The animation is usually very slow, allowing for more verbal humor than physical humor. OH MY GOD IS THAT AN AWFUL CHOICE. ""Hotel Transylvania: The Series"" needs SO MUCH MORE physical humor! And the main reasoning for this is that the verbal humor is near unbearable! Some physical humor would make this cartoon a lot livelier.

Probably the best part about this show is the voice acting. That's not to say that the characters are good--in fact, I hate almost every one of them. They're either annoying, unlikable, or too idiotic to care about. The voice acting helps this a little bit, however, since the voice actors are honestly not horrible replacements for the original's. Okay, it's no Vincent Price performance, but it's... Passable. The voice actors helped me a lot to not make me want to punch one of these characters in the face. Particularly Mavis. Her voice actor--Bryn McAuley--adds some much needed life to this character and really steals the show. In fact, she's really the only character that I don't mind. She can be really annoying at times, but she's definitely one of the better characters.

All in all, this show is a definite skip. It's harmless to show to your kid if there is literally nothing better on, but I would rather watch... Anything else, except maybe ""Teen Titans Go!"". Just... Don't pay any mind to it if you don't have to."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Boom Draca-laca! (I love you Mavis...),"Though my feelings about the movies are at best mixed, I found this to be a charming animated show that actually works better.

There's nothing too ground breaking in this supernatural sitcom set-up but I find that rather refreshing. I feel this feels more like something made in the early 2000s and that is not meant to be an insult with its fast paced stories providing easy, casual viewing.

The artistic direction and design is just superb. I really felt immersed in this homage to classic horror but with a slick, contemporary twist with rich world building in which I could believe there was a secret culture where marginalized creatures live beyond the domain of humans. The red-and-black interior design of the hotel is at once enticing and oddly soothing.

The humor is mostly narrative driven unless it plays off the setting and it can be somewhat repellent or juvenile which I didn't love but it does restrain itself quite a bit more than the movies in that respect.

I'm unsure, however, whether I am really a fan of the show or weather I am just a fan of Mavis. In the movies the plots revolved more about other characters doing things regarding her but here she is unambiguously the protagonist and they fleshed her out nicely. She is a sweet but mischievous girl who doesn't mind bending the rules or the truth to get what she wants but is loyal to her friends and has a very positive relationship with her doting father.

Her character animation and facial expressions are just delight after delight, the way she does her little joy dance or looks nonplussed when a plot thickens. She is naughty but nice.

I watched this mostly in the French and Polish dubs which were fabulous, especially Margarite D'amour and Zuzanna Bernat respectively as Mavis. However, Bryn McAuley was also amazing, all three being far more appealing than Gomez.

Also, Mavis' design translates to two dimensions so well.

I won't say this show wasn't somewhat disposable but sometimes you need something like that. I really want more episodes on Netflix!"
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Sucks so bad,The animations is terrible. The storyline is terrible. The new characters don't make sense. And this show shows how Disney has run out of ideas for sure.
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Surprisingly entertaining!,"I stumbled across this show by accident - and I love it. I love the setting, I love the writing, and I love the (voice) acting. Mavis has become my #2 cartoon crush after Scooby-Doo's Velma Dinkley (I know, my choices probably say a lot about me!), she's hilarious. A fun way to fill a quarter of an hour! 8/10"
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Characters We've Never Seen Before,"Usually when a TV Series is done from an exist movie or show, they add the same characters that were in the original, except this time the only original character frim the movies is the daughter, the rest are characters we have never seen or heard annoy before, so it is very hard to get into the series because of this.

I seriously do not know when the timeline for this series takes place, I'm sure they've explained that to use, but I was so distracted by trying to figure out what was going on, I could never understand the entire show, and I refuse to watch any more.

It's not funny, each episode is irritating, and it's just another example of Disney not coming up with anything new, but just being disingenuous to the fans versus giving us the same characters we enjoyed in the original movies."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,Holy Rabies!!,"Hotel Transylvania: TV Series is a pretty good show. Because it's based on an Animated original movie that takes place before Mavis Dracula, which is my favorite character so far, Mavis met Jonathan. In the show she had to take very good care of the Hotel as her father Count Dracula, puts her in charge of the Hotel. And this show is not half bad."
Hotel Transylvania: The Series,I really don't understand why people don't like.,Characters are a little different from original but animation is good. I really like job Voice actors do especially melodic sound of Mavis. And humours are so witty. I hope they continue do sequel.

It's not funny, each episode is irritating, and it's just another example of Disney not coming up with anything new, but just being disingenuous to the fans versus giving us the same characters we enjoyed in the original movies."
Madam Secretary,Holy Rabies!!,"Hotel Transylvania: TV Series is a pretty good show. Because it's based on an Animated original movie that takes place before Mavis Dracula, which is my favorite character so far, Mavis met Jonathan. In the show she had to take very good care of the Hotel as her father Count Dracula, puts her in charge of the Hotel. And this show is not half bad."
Madam Secretary,I really don't understand why people don't like.,Characters are a little different from original but animation is good. I really like job Voice actors do especially melodic sound of Mavis. And humours are so witty. I hope they continue do sequel.
Madam Secretary,Hotel,It was great to make Season 3. Do not get bored of the builders. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA It was great to make Season 3. Do not get bored of the builders. Hotel TRANSYLVANIA.

Seventeen,Hey wait a second... is Mickey 17 been shown somewhere?!!,"Yeah I've been waiting for Mickey 17 since it was announced in 2022 and the original release date of January 2024 was much more attractive.

The very first 2022 teaser of naked Robert Pattinson ominously slowly spinning in a cryotube/ CT scan machine with the glowy blue lighting was the best thing about this movie.

It made it look like an ALIEN film which was way too exciting, since it is director Bong Joon Ho's first film since Parasite in 2019.

However, the subsequent 2 trailers in the following years have been more comedic in nature. Darkly comedic and have deterred from the more creepy scientific style of the first teaser. Maybe its my fault for reading too much into it, since the teaser betrayed a sense of sci-fi dread.

So here I am writing a review for a film, that shouldn't be even out yet much less be reviewed. I hope the dark comedy isn't all it has going for it, (which usually doesn't for a Bong Joon Ho film or Korean content for that matter) as the seemingly idiotic character of Robert doesn't inspire much confidence in a film that can be taken much too seriously...

Hope Mickey 17 is as good as I first hoped! 10:55am."
Bard of Blood,Twisted Plot and an Amazing show,"Really loved this TV Show, good acting by all the actors specially Emraan Hashmi doing a really good job. Entertaining till the end and will keep you engaged through out. I think Bollywood movies should learn a lot from a tv show like this which shows no nonsensical drama to keep you engaged. Beautiful screen play, Action-filled, suspenseful and a step forward to the level of Hollywood tv shows such as Homeland and Jack Ryan."
Bard of Blood,Interesting espionage thriller from India.....,"I have had little exposure to Indian cinema but if Bard of Blood is anything to go by, that may change.

This is a competent and well paced espionage thriller that predictably is nationalistic in character but not so much so, that its overbearing. Its cause is helped by a reasonable, if formulaic story and lots of action, in all the right places.

On the downside there are subs but really, I did not find this a substantial impediment, as a decent amount of this series runs on action and visuals.

All in all, a worthwhile watch that's accessible to a wide audience. 7/10."
Bard of Blood,Good but not great!,"Bard of Blood is a political espionage thriller that is based on a book with the same name by Bilal Siddiqi.

Produced by SRK's Red Chiilies Entertainment, this Netflix original stars Emraan Hashmi in the lead role supported beautifully by Vineet Singh, Sobhita Dhulipala, Jaideep Ahlawat and others.

The story is good however, the execution is not very great. It has been shot delightfully even though the narrative is confusing for some parts. A surprise element towards the end saves it for the otherwise lack of grip in the script. The hand to hand combat sequences are nice though. I, for some reason binge watched the whole season that has 7 episodes of 45 min each.

Emraan Hashmi is a great actor and he carries himself nicely as Kabir Anand (I wonder why every other spy is called by this name). Sobhita Dhulipala is equally good while Vineet Singh struggles a bit with the Punjabi accent but is good overall. The rest of the cast is on point.

Had there been a less convoluted transition of events, this would have been at par with the other series, say ""The Family Man"". It is good if not great!"
Bard of Blood,Have many flaws but still good to watch..,Every thing in the mission succeeded easily. I think some lack in direction. Hope they bring something good in season 2. And the climax is quite common.
Bard of Blood,Hashmi shines in a topnotch spy thriller series.,"Netflix series Bard of Blood, based on a novel of the same name by Bilal Siddiqi.

The series, however, succeeds in showing us the human side of spies.

The biggest achievements and sacrifices made by spies generally go unnoticed by the people of the country.

Watching Bard of Blood one not only gets an idea about every aspect of their lives..,, but there is much more to it.

Story revolves around terrorism in Balochistan, pakistan & Taliban.

Emraan Hashmi leads from the front, n he gets here a good script after long time.

Overall, Bard of Blood is a topnotch thriller series based on well-researched subject that touches to the time we live in.

If you like spy thrillers then Bard of Blood is something that you dont want to miss.

One time watch for sure."
Bard of Blood,Location Killed it. Like the Guns killing each and one.,"Remarkable improvements in web-series. Background Score is brilliant. Acting is good, no doubt about it. But the Location had it all. It's what it made is real."
Bard of Blood,Desi version of spy thriller,The intention was good but series was badly scripted and screenplay is too bad. You can watch it for acting though otherwise everything else looks fallen apart. The director of each episode looks confused with character and stories. You will also not get the thrill and adrenaline rush which was usually expected from such series. Watch it just to add one more coin in you piggybank of cinema.
Bard of Blood,Superb cast,"One of the best show on Netfix , Ends with a shocking climax . Everyone played their character very well .locations, Acting , story everything is perfect Now waiting for season -2"
Bard of Blood,Not as engaging as i thought,"I would say when i heard its production unit has Shahrukh's name, it rose a curiosity but somehow, it turned opposite. Series location is good, screenplay is ok, Emraan as lead is capable and did some job in here but Story lacked its spirit. Was in bits and pieces, some how i felt it lacked a grip to engage viewer.

Watch it if you have already seen other tv series. Not in my priority list to recommend."
Bard of Blood,Knew after the first episode that it would not be worth my time. Watched it anyways.,Comentario no disponible
Bard of Blood,Full of action,"Perfect storyline and entertaining. Lots of action , imran did it well."
Bard of Blood,Poor actors ruined it. One time watch.,"Worth one time watch. Sobhita Dhulipala wasn't convincing in the role at all, her dialogue delivery was rubbish. They made actors speak regional languages obviously for authenticity but their dialogue delivery wasn't convincing at all, shouldve stuck with Urdu for the most part. Also, the worst acting award for this season goes to Kallirroi Taziafeta who played the American agent. 😂."
Bard of Blood,"Netflix, why?",Comentario no disponible
Bard of Blood,7/10,"I have read the book and all i can say is that this show is subtle in its own nature. I am satisfied with how it is put up but it could have been better.

Acting is solid but not all the actors did well, there were some characters they were just like forcing acting out of them and the thing concerning most was storytelling in front of the camera was weak. I felt there were plenty of loop holes.

Director managed pretty well and hope Season 2 gets better..."
Bard of Blood,"Seemed a bit far fetched, sort of hard to follow, but I liked it.","There's a ton of holes you can blow through this series, from cops not following after a shoot out, talaban easily infiltrated, the way people seemed to get around so quickly made for unbelievable timeline, just a lot of holes. That said, I still liked it and watched it all the way to the season 2 cliffhanger. The acting was very good, action good, location good, storyline was even good despite some implausabilities. So this one rates a 7, fair."
Bard of Blood,A must watch series,A well made series of action drama thrill this series has done a great job in direction screenplay acting everything in this series is great
Bard of Blood,A disappointment from Red Chillies,"Series could have done with better direction, music and well-developed characters. Kirti Kulhari stood out. Some episodes are 40mins long with 3 mins of boring end credits. I could predict events from the start and it turned out exactly at end. Overall=average but could have been more gripping for a spy thriller."
Bard of Blood,It Is Good,"Don't know why people are criticizing this show so bad. And comparing it to the family man. Both show are based on Balochistan. Both have different storyline,purpose and different aspect of story telling. Definitely worth a watch. And that last exposure scene is you can't think of. GO SEE IT."
Bard of Blood,Many flaws but watchable once,Comentario no disponible
Bard of Blood,Headache series 🤕🤕,"Literally got headache after watching this series , too much lengthy , don't know what's going on. So much expectation from series but Reduced interest episode by episode"
Bard of Blood,Felt good,"Just completed watching Bard of Blood in one go and I thought of writing a brief review, a story as usual has some loopholes and definitely exaggeration of events. however, all in all it was entertaining and keeps viewers interested.....Vineet Singh was the best actor to me, Emraan is very underrated as an actor but he did justice to his role and looked good as well."
Bard of Blood,High adrenalin Bollywood espionage thriller,"Based on the novel of the same name by Bilal Siddiqi, this series is like a Bollywood espionage thriller complete with high end weapon props and special effects. Even the protagonist herein is Emraan Hashmk, a Bollywood mainstream hero.

He plays a former intelligence officer who is sent on a crucial rescue mission to Balochistan to free four Indian intelligence officers from the clutches of Taliban. Though Balochistan is the place of his painful past, still he moves ahead with the mission and enters into the complex web of past associations, risky plannings, secret hideouts, failures and triumphs.

The series is like a usual Bollywood spy thriller, no more no less."
Bard of Blood,Lousy and 80% waste of time,"Script: 2/10 (Please don't use google to translate your hindi script into Pashtu or Farsi. Pashtu & Farsi translations/dialogues and their delivery were as bad as it could be. If you can't get your actors speak the local language then DON'T include such stuff to make it feel real.

Story: 3/10

Cast: 4/10 (actors could have done better, but I guess that's what director asked them to do)

Direction: 3/10 Very cliché. Typical Bollywood masala movie style. The only thing which differentiate this series from other mainstream Bollywood stuff is Shahrukh Khan dances with butterflies on item songs, though I was expecting that somewhere down the line.

Location (outdoor): 6/10 (somehow managed to create a little bit feel of local authenticity)

Location (indoor): 6/10 (gave to much attention and in result end up overdoing the interiors with lots of Arabic scripts, cultural decoration and other small elements at the surroundings but put way to little efforts to get the soul in the indoor shots)

Local culture: 2/10 (miserably failed to rightly portray the local culture, language, norms, values and traditions, director should have spent at least an hour or so to study that.)

Costumes: 6/10

Actions: 3/10 (Either you make it look real or you take cinematic liberties, director was riding both the boats at the same time.)

Music & title graphics: 3/10

ADVISE TO DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER Please don't come up with season 2 within 6 or 8 months time. The least you could do to get some inspiration is to watch Reluctant Fundamentalist, Zero Dark Thirty, The Road to Guantanamo or some stuff of Anurag Kashyap or Quentin Trantino."

Love Alarm,Why NETFLIX WHYYYY,"I was so happy to see just 8 episodes and heard so much about this drama that I watched the entire series at one go but the ending was sooooo annoying! like why would u stop the series there! Besides the 2nd season is stuck bcz of pandemic and the waiting is killing me! Other than that, I m just happy to live in a world where love alarm doesn't exist! It's definitely the worst thing ever. Specially when there's a shield!"

Love Alarm,"Not bad, not bad indeed",It could have easily been a movie or an episode on black mirror. It was great but i found it too silent and draggy as it went on. However the chemistry between kim JoJo and rich model boy was lit
Love Alarm,Okay kdrama that had potential,Comentario no disponible
Love Alarm,Worst,It was so good but now it is the worst drama i have ever seen before
Love Alarm,"There will be a second season, relax","I can't believe how many reviews are only basing it off the cliffhanger. From what I could see, the webtoon goes way past where the first season ended, so just sit back and wait for season 2 and stop your bellyaching about the cliffhanger, they're super common in Asian dramas.

That being said, the story is fascinating. It has a big tech-fiction edge to it that is relatable to all of us that are so addicted to our phones and apps. The main characters are all great and very well cast. The feels are there, so much feels and the chemistry between the 2 main characters is like a fire that burns inside you! If you're a fan of k-dramas you'll love this one for sure, and if you aren't maybe wait until it's completed before you watch it or you'll just whine about the cliffhanger, or you know just go into it knowing you'll have a juicy cliffhanger that will get you excited for season 2."
Love Alarm,The biggest toxic lie ever😂,Comentario no disponible
Love Alarm,Great 1st season; Truly awful 2nd season,"I won't go into detail why the first season is phenomenal, especially the firts half of it is amazing, but oh my god....I waited so so long for the 2nd season and it was a huge disaster. The direction it takes is nonsensical and it missed so many great chances. And as others have pointed out, no character is really likeable. I watched the last half of the 2nd season in 1.5x speed, just to not waste even more of my time. Honestly, just watch the first season and dream up your own ending."
Love Alarm,Smooth Opening and Smooth Ending for Season 1,"Of Course! there will be season 2. K-dramas usually have 16 or more episodes. Netflix added only 8 and the story is still incomplete. This show had one of the most interesting concept I've ever seen. K-dramas in general revolve around romance, a back story and A unique concept. But Love Alarm in general is a very beautiful blend of futuristic technology in daily life of youngsters when an app called Love alarm (JoAlarm) is launched which tells a person about how many people in a 10m radius love them. As expected this causes several beautiful phenomenon and some violence and sad happenings which is shown in the show very thoughtfully. People who watch K-dramas must watch Love Alarm. while others can give it a try."
Love Alarm,Good one but Sun Oh and Jojo should end up together,"If Sun Oh and Jojo don't end up together, then there is basically no justice in k drama land and ultimately it will become the worst show for sure. Sun Oh and Jojo must remain together. They have major chemistry."
Love Alarm,A lot of KDramas end after 1 season. This one should have.,Comentario no disponible
Love Alarm,I loved itttt,It was so good I binged watched it all night & I really hope there's going to be a 2nd season with that awesome cliffhanger <3
Love Alarm,Depicting Complexities of Relationships,"Though having the elements of typical k-drama, Love Alarm stands out and is unique that addresses issues like mental health and negative impact of social media addiction.

The most admirable thing about this drama is it's depiction of complexities of relationships and ever changing human emotions and feelings. This drama exhibits how over dependence on technologies can create further problems. It was good to see how the central characters were making efforts instead of solely relying on what ""Love Alarm"" app was suggesting.

Watching Love Alarm felt like a emotional rollercoaster ride. Though an enjoyable good drama, some confusion still remains in the end. However the ending is not bad at all as many are claiming. It's just that you'll feel sad for some character who has a bittersweet ending. Overall it's a good to watch drama."

Love Alarm,Soooo gooood!,"I never do reviews, like ever.

This however I binged the first season and had been waiting for what felt like a lifetime for season 2.

I loved every part of this series, location, scenes, characters, script, soundtrack, storyline.

Giving credit where it's due because I'd feel bad for not expressing how much I loved this show.

Highly recommend I can guarantee that I'll be re-watching and will still cry over a scene 😭😍"
Love Alarm,Not bad,Fantasy Love story;;; Not bad But it is not my type. too much....not natural
Love Alarm,Worst kdrama ever😖,"I really loved season 1 and so I waited for season 2 for nearly two freaking years hoping to see Jojo and Sun oh ending up together but the things turned out to be different. Kim Jojo acted too cold towards Sun oh and Hye Yeong showed how selfish a friend can become. He only cared about how he feels, he didn't care at all about Sun oh. I just don't understand why Jojo did that to Sun oh. Love alarm was my favourite until season 2 came. Season 2 ruined my excitement and and my two years of waiting."

Love Alarm,Peaked halfway,Show peaked halfway. Had such a good start and an amazing relationship between the two main characters. Then it fell off towards the end of season one. Definitely doesn't make me want to watch season 2 or even finish season one.

Spirit: Riding Free,Okay for kids. Film lovers will be disappointed.,"It should be noted while some sources said that the horse is actually Spirit's son, I believe that's far from the case as I don't think we'll ever see the characters from the original film appear on this show. This is definitely meant to be a complete rewrite of Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron. I can see fans of the film won't be happy about this.

On the other hand, it's a kids show so of course things will be watered down. In this show, Spirit becomes semi-tamed (not completely tamed thankfully). He starts out as a wild horse but forms a connection with the girl Lucky, who still allows Spirit the freedom to go to and from as he pleases. And they never put a saddle or bridle on him.

As someone who loved the original film, you better believe I'm disappointed with the changes made. As far as the show goes though, it's okay. It's about as much as you would expect without getting cringey. Season 1 has a mix of good, meh, and bad episodes. If you're a horse lover, you might like the show good enough. If the writers are willing to take more chances with future seasons, it does have the potential of being a decent kids show."
Spirit: Riding Free,An unoriginal and kinda bland sequel.,"I'm going to be honest, I never liked the Spirit movie as a kid. I thought it was boring at the time while my brother and friends loved it. I rewatched it recently and came to like it more now, even with the narration quotes. Then I looked at this, honestly can't say the same. It's harmless, the main girl character is okay but the show is similar to past little girl riding horses cartoon with the friendship dynamic. I do appreciate trying to put adventure in it a little bit, doesn't drag out too much. When I saw this, I thought it was Spirit from the first movie until I saw its his son. Way to make them look exactly the same and have the same title with the only thing different is the white streak on his snout. Couldn't they add maybe more white on his hooves or his mane? Whatever.

If I were to show either the movie or the show to a child, I would pick the movie in a heartbeat. Where the movie will be remembered, this show will be most likely forgotten."
Spirit: Riding Free,"My 2 year old daughter is hooked, but...","I must say it makes me dizzy with its inaccuracies. First of, riding a horse without any gear. Is that even possible as portrayed? 2. Dress. I am appalled at the premise that since these are country girls they wear jeans and shirts and reject dresses. Same goes for Mrs. Flores, the teacher. Is this the XIX or XX century? 3. Culture. Miradero seems seems set in an alternate Politically Correct Wild West, where all races mingle smoothly, streets are tidy, public services work (except raíl serviced which get constantly interrupted) and all are Protestant and middle class, when you have a Hispanic population which at the time was very Catholic. And the name of the town, Miradero it should have given you a hint it would have been a Spanish Town...Where is the Catholic church and the Plaza? Then, names and race quite don't match for example Mrs. Flores is a typically anglo Lady not your more common Hispanic white, Maricela is redhaired and pretty much the same, redhaired and anglo. Then we have Pru and her dad...what about her mom? And why are they so intégrated? Then the Architecture, it seems like an ecclectic mix of Spanish-revival and XIX Century styles. Then you have clases and status, why does Pru and Abigail look so middle class? What makes them different from Maricela or Fortuna? It would have made it much richer and deeper the plot and setting if it would have been made as accurate as the movie that inspired...the name at least. Also boyfriend-girlfriend stuff is more appropiate for teenagers not 7 year old kids. But Dreamworks decided to go the easyway and just project the XXI century into the XIX..."
Spirit: Riding Free,"Calm down, it's a show for kids.","Sure, this isn't a show for history buffs or die-hard Spirit enthusiasts, but it's a cute and entertaining show for kids. If the horse had any other name I think people could calm down and stop getting so angry that this isn't a ""true"" depiction of wild horses and their behaviour. The characters' eyes are also bigger than their mouths, so chill out. The show is entertaining and one of the few things I can watch with my toddler and not hate. The characters are sweet, mostly likable and the stories - while far-fetched - are fun and usually have some kind of lesson thrown in."
Spirit: Riding Free,More than one Spirit in this world.,"The horse in Spirit Riding Free is not the same horse as the horse in Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron. The original Spirit was a Dun (Dun stripe down the middle of his back) The Horse in Spirit Riding Free is a Buckskin and has no Dun stripe.

Now. Problem solved. All of you that are so offended can calm down.

More than one horse name Spirit in this world. My son has a Dun horse, colored like the original Spirit because he Loves the Original movie. He also Loves the series too. Not the same story. Not the same horse. Calm down. Enjoy the series. It's good fun and in no way has insulted your favorite of the Spirits.

Also I'd like to point out that the original movie and the series are fictional. Horses do not behave in this manner. I've trained horses for over twenty years. These stories are for kids. They are not real."

Spirit: Riding Free,Well...,"I'm not going to deny that this is a great series for children. It teaches young girls that they can solve their own problems without being too dependent on other people; aside from friends. That's something to be admired.

The low rating comes from the title. This animated series has nothing to do with Spirit, the horse. The title of the series is meant for leeching off the success that was of Spirit, the movie. Honestly, if they changed the name of the series to something else - you couldn't even tell that this had anything to do with Spirit. The low rating is due to the disgust of clickbait.

If you're an adult looking for nostalgia - skip this. If you're an adult with children - watch it with them and silently scoff and roll your eyes."
Spirit: Riding Free,"Good generic ""girls riding horses"" show, but associating it with Spirit is 100% bait","If you want your generic girls riding and bonding horses show, its cute and funny, and it is 100% what you would expect from this kind of show. I came as a a fan of the original but this was enjoyable on its own and doesn't require seeing the original movie.

If you were looking for something like the namesake, a movie about a wild horse stumbling through the taming of the wild west and the struggle of Native Americans, who also bonds with a human through their trials, there is nothing for you here. The only thing this has in common with the movie is the name. The only real nods to the movie within the show itself is where they show that this Spirit is the original's son in the pony tails shorts, and they occasionally use Spirit not liking rope as a plotpoint. They basically used the name as a marketing tool, they could replace Spirit with any wild horse and nothing would change.

I was gonna go for 5 stars since it was a good show but completely lied for the title, but I think other fans of the original keep giving it a terrible score just out of revenge for the title so I'll help bump it up a bit."

Spirit: Riding Free,Heartbreaking,"I LOVED the Spirit Movie as a child, it was my favorite movie, and still is at heart. When I heard a new series was coming out, I got so exited... until I saw it... it broke my heart. How could they ruin my childhood with.....THIS! The graphics are ALL wrong, it looks horrible.. Yeah I get it, it's for children.. but really....? You could have done better than this! I really hate the whole story of it too... this is not the Spirit I remember.. </3"
Spirit: Riding Free,"It's not the film, but IS a great show for kids","No, ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" it is not. I can see why fans of the movie are disappointed (offended just screams snowflake to me) and yes, historically it is not accurate in terms of fashion and life in frontier America. There are anachronisms aplenty. BUT it's a children's show about girls who go on adventures with their horses and learn important lessons in friendship and life. Yes the animation is somewhat lazy (limited character types) but I would argue that the storylines are original and interesting. There is humour and some very touching moments too. I really enjoy it as does my 4 year old daughter. And the 3 protagonists represent all kinds of girl, from girly girl to tomboy and all independent, intelligent people who are kind and loyal to their friends with an accurate amount of teenage attitude I'd say. It really doesn't deserve the bad reviews it's getting here! The toys (barbie type dolls) are crap so buy the Playmobil stuff as this is good. Or don't buy the toys and just enjoy a wholesome kids show about young girls and their horses. Just chill out a bit about it!"
Spirit: Riding Free,What?,"Has any of the creators watched the original movie? I think not. The whole concept of the movie was the inability of anyone to tame Spirit. Adding the white stripe on his face does not make the two separate if the color and name are the exact same. The original Spirit was named such because no one could break the spirit he had to be free. If you're going to do a spin-off series, at least make it complement the original somehow. Do not allow anyone to ride Spirit because that is out of character. The tv show may be cute for kids, but it is a disgrace to the amazing movie that is ""Spirit."""
Spirit: Riding Free,This show even has me hooked!,"Such a cute show! My son loves it! I've never seen the movie but apparently there's an uproar over the show vs. the movie and I guess they aren't the same or have anything to do with each other. But reguardless, it's a great show and I catch myself watching it all the time."
Spirit: Riding Free,Great show for the whole family!,"This is a light-hearted, family-friendly show that our daughters love. The show encourages their love of horses and just having clean-hearted fun as a young girl. It is nice to find a program that they enjoy and one that we as parents find entertaining as well."
Spirit: Riding Free,Ruined my childhood movie,"I absolutely hate the idea of this, the plot of this story DEFEATS the whole purpose of the original movie ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"" where Spirit should remain free and not ridden by ANYBODY. I am disgusted by the thought of some 12 year-old CITY girl riding such a courageous and rebellious horse. The new ""Spirit"" has a completely new obedient and submissive nature. I'm heartbroken that this new film has tainted my favorite childhood movie. Quite frankly, I wouldn't mind if this show was shut down."
Spirit: Riding Free,Favorite of ours,"Perhaps if you've not seen the movie, you would enjoy the Spirit series as much as we do. We like how girls are empowered to be problem solvers even if situations are improbable and often dangerous. Watching the same episodes multiple times does not diminish the excellent characterization. We are thankful the series is continuing."
Spirit: Riding Free,Please show your children Spirit: Stallion of The Cimarron instead,"I don't believe in boycotting TV or film, but if I did, this would be first on the list. All I can do is beg you (anyone reading this) to not indulge DreamWorks with its seemingly rampant war on art. Watch the film upon which it's 'based', honestly, watch Spirit: Stallion of The Cimarron, I promise it will be a wonderful experience for anyone, adult or child. It really is a fantastic piece of film-making, let alone animation.

Leave this and other DreamWorks (usually Netflix co-produced) well alone I beg. This especially bears no resemblance to anything the film represented. The level of animation alone will show you how little DreamWorks cared about making this in any way respectable. All I can say is I hope anyone who reads this follows my advice and tells more people. I don't believe in boycotting, but if as few people watch it as possible, they might see it's not worth it. This 'remake' is an utter shambles and disgraces the beautiful film it is apparently inspired by. Please. Watch Spirit: Stallion of The Cimarron instead."
Spirit: Riding Free,A Great Cartoon,"This isn't about the movie.

This isn't about frontier history.

It's a stand-alone project for tween girls, and it's excellent. Empowerment, freedom, rising to meet a challenge, humility, courage, empathy, unbreakable friendships and fierce loyalty, responsibility, facing your fears, risking your life for loved ones, family, resisting the pressure to 'conform to the norm, ' admitting mistakes, apologizing and saying, ""I'm sorry,"" childish mistakes not blown out of proportion, willful disobedience dealt with compassionately and straightforwardly, blended family, single parent - a great many situations that tween girls face are modeled and dealt with superbly.

You don't have to like the show. Just quit picking on it for not being what you want it to be. It isn't your show. If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything. Young girls are watching."
Spirit: Riding Free,Irrational anger in s1e2,"Character development is terrible in this show. I was willing to let that part go for it being a child's show. Season 1 episode 2 changed my mind and made me shut off the show. The irrational anger in the father of one of the main characters was too much. I don't want my daughter thinking it is right to be angry towards someone over something that was completely out of their control. This show is terribly written and is not fluid in its story at all. It's like watching a train wreck from beginning to end and the train just keeps hitting boulders, starting back up and hitting another boulder. I guess not everyone can write like the writers of Last Airbender."
Spirit: Riding Free,My favorite cartoon,"As a Mom of a toddler girl I end up watching cartoons and I have to say as an adult this one is by far my favorite. The characters are well written, the storylines are great, it's extremely engaging. Big bonus is that it centers on three young girls who are brave, independent, strong, and smart. Keep the seasons coming Dreamworks!"
Spirit: Riding Free,Great,"This show is amazing sooo many life lessons, intense and heart warming show. Honestly I am in love with this show. Im hooked."
Spirit: Riding Free,Totally awful,"Historically inaccurate, poor graphics, and totally should not have the same name as such a great movie."
Spirit: Riding Free,Not bad actually,"Found the show first on YouTube as 5 minute shorts, and my youngest daughter (4 yr old) seemed to like it. Then not long after we got Netflix and found it on there, she's got really into it, even my eldest daughter (13) has said she likes it (in fact they are watching happily together right now in a fort in the living room). Although the writing can sometimes be a bit simple or contrived with not too much depth there is still enough going on to keep them entertained. the characters are likeable and strong willed are good role models for young girls."
Spirit: Riding Free,For those telling us to calm down..,"Dreamworks could have chosen a different title so that we wouldn't even need to complain..

Spirit is not meant to be this way -ridden-. Maybe another horse.

I mean, even the design doesn't do the movie-it's-based-on any justice, so why relate to it, in this bad way, at all?! They could have just colored the horses differently and they would be new ones. I would be as easy as that. No problems.

The original movie could have been just used for inspiration, so they didn't need to ruin it this way.."
Spirit: Riding Free,My 6 year old son loved it!,"I came across this show on Netflix. I've never seen the original movie, and neither has my son. It sounds like this is quite different from the movie and should be viewed as a separate show. For me, personally, the show didn't do much. I thought the quality of the animation was sub-par. The story lines seemed a little silly. On the positive side, the stories were reasonably well written and carried you along. The main reason I give this 8 out of 10 stars is because my 6 year old son loved it. I'm sure my son would give it 10 out of 10 stars. He watched all the episodes one after another and never got bored. Through the eyes of an adult, I wouldn't bother, but if you want you children to be entertained, I can say that mine was greatly entertained. It always makes me happy to see my kid happy, so thanks Dreamworks for making my son happy."

The Forest,"Okay, intriguing, but also full of unlikely stuff","It was worth watching but not really super captivating. There were a number of good characters and interesting subplots, but Virginia - who is pretty much the main character - is the worst police officer in history and in any realistic scenario would have been thrown off the case and probably out of the force by her new boss within the first day."
The Forest,Solid acting and nuanced storytelling,"A satisfying binge. I highly recommend watching this while NOT folding the laundry. That way you can be present for the entire story and enjoy the excellent acting and well-told, suspenseful murder mystery.

What another reviewer identifies as ""tropes"" were not actually dramatized as such -- the female detective did not get more involved or emotional than you would expect for someone searching for her missing daughter (filmmakers were actually quite restrained in how they presented this). Also, there weren't any of the stereotypical ego clashes between the outsider and the insiders on the police force. The new captain did indeed recently move to town and only the first episode depicted the awkwardness of this dynamic, and what was shown would be natural to this plot detail. It wasn't an ongoing part of the story in the way it would be on a prime time American drama. In fact, I enjoyed that there wasn't any development of the stereotypical ""clash"" between the new captain and his staff (that would have been a trope).

I would say this show is on par with Broadchurch in terms of acting and production quality but with a slightly more simplistic and traditional story and resolution. Most implausibilities had decent explanations and probably more so than do the typical crime drama. The acting and unfolding of the story were nuanced, and restraint was used with plot details that could have become cliche.

I especially enjoyed the story's two intertwined layers - the search for the missing girls and the teacher's search for her identity."
The Forest,Good weekend mini-binge series,"Occasionally, I like ""mini-binge watching netflix"" with my wife on the weekend. One of my gripes about most series is that they start strong but eventually the story line degenerates into a typical soap opera, the premise is lost, the series drags on and on, and the conclusion(if they ever get to one) is unsatisfactory.

That does NOT happen in the little gem.

This series is short enough that you can get the satisfaction of finishing it over a weekend. The story is really good with enough layers to keep things interesting, the acting/character development is great, and the very final scene/conclusion is good.

It's dubbed, (french language movie) but after one episode, you won't even notice it.

Well done."
The Forest,"Taut writing and direction, marred by comically over-the-top performance from Clément","This series has faults but it kept me intrigued until the end. Unlike many Netflix-derived European series these days, this one has competent camera work, disciplined direction and a taut script. Sure, there's some fallible plot points and drawn-out scenes that could have been excised. The incompetent deputy ineptly played by Suzanne Clément almost derails the whole thing, causing me to burst out laughing at the wrong moments, negating the intended dramatic tension. Despite those drawbacks, the cast is solid, the story involving though perhaps far-flung at points. Worth a look even with its drawbacks. I enjoyed it and looked forward to each episode. I can't say that for many Netflix series these days."
The Forest,Intriguing from beginning to end,I thought this was really well done. Every one of the 6 episodes contained some kind of revelation and cliffhanger that kept me going onto the next one. I binged watched this series in about 3 days and really enjoyed it. Interesting characters and a plot that kept you guessing. Highly recommended.
The Forest,Eve in the Forest - Engaging but too many holes.,"I binge watched it so definitely keeps you engaged. The Broadchurch inspiration is telling unfortunately the writing is nowhere near it and the police captain is no David Tenant. The good part is some solid acting by the cast, excellent locations and the initial episodes do create the aura of mystery. The worst part is the characterisation of the cops. Literally every bit of evidence and finding is found by the French teacher Eve. The actress who played the lady cop was very good but the character deplorable. She always look dishevelled, in India you would get fired if you turned up that way. Every bit of evidence is shared with everyone in the village by her, doesn't listen to her boss, acts irrationally most of the time, messes up critical evidence, lets go of a key witness and worst part sits on a missing girl's case claiming its a prank. And her all out drive when its her own daughter is sickening, no objectivity as a cop. The captain cop plays really dull, the only bright characters are Eve , her father, Oceane's father and Oceane. And the motive for the murders ,after watching close to 6 hours doesn't get even 6 secs.You are left wondering why.."
The Forest,The Forest,"This six part French series is set in a village in the Ardennes where a sixteen year old girl, Jennifer Lenoir, has gone missing. Leading the investigation is Captain Gaspard Deke, who arrived in the village the day Jennifer went missing. Soon afterwards two more girls vanish, including the adopted daughter of Lt Virginie Musso. Evidence suggests that Jennifer disappeared in the vast forest which surrounds the village. As the series progresses suspects and motives emerge and events occur which will have a profound effect on those involved. A second mystery is provided by a teacher whose true identity is unknown; she was found near the forest as a young child, with no memory of what had happened to her before that.

I found this to be a gripping mystery. The setting is fairly stunning and added to the atmosphere impressively; the forest surrounding the village created a sense of isolation. Having a newly transferred officer lead the investigation serves well to introduce the viewer to the location and its inhabitants as we learn about things as he does. The resolution is satisfying without being too obvious. There are plenty of tense moments, especially towards the end. The cast does a solid job bringing their characters to life. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of subtitled crime drama.

These comments are based on watching the series in French with English subtitles."

The Forest,Immersive tale of crazy crimes,"I binged this series in one night because I desperately needed a break from reality. For this purpose, it's a very good pick , provided you like beautifully-shot forest scenes and don't mind the borderline insane plot that seems to come with many French miniseries productions. It's got a very nice soundtrack, it's a wild ride overall and it makes a good effort to connect all the loose ends in its last episode, with touching symbolism thrown in as a garnish....What more could one want?"
The Forest,Doesn't it bother y'all about SO many stupid things the police do?,"I'm only just starting episode 4 and the whole credibility about even the captain, no nonsense, by the book guy just let's way too much bad procedures of running a station go by. The acting, the scenery is good but they just make way too many screw ups. Well, I guess it would only be a two episode program otherwise. I'll try the rest of it, I guess. Maybe I'm too picky. (no, I just like good stuff!)"
The Forest,Excellent but...,"No way would a Captain allow his lieutenant to scream at witnesses and act on her own without consulting him...even if it was her daughter missing. She should have been taken off the case immediately or it shouldn't have been her daughter that was missing. Otherwise, excellent drama, good pacing, slow revelations without stupid surprises. Great scenery, good music. A good show of what goes around comes around!"
The Forest,How does Virginie still have a job?,Comentario no disponible
The Forest,Worst cop ever,That Virginie person might be the worst cop I ever saw on TV.
The Forest,Suspense elements are absurdly suppressed in this botched script.,"Great potential. Some of the lead actor's character developments are zero. A veteran policewoman acting sloppy all the time and even throwing up at the sight of naked dead woman in the forest. Not the hallmark of a decent series. The plot makers never fully explore the mysterious drawings and the life of abandoned protagonist when she was estranged from her mom. When a serial murderer is on the prowl, the girls dont even think they are next and continue doing shady things... Silly and utterly unrealistic. Another big loophole is how memory is handled in human minds.. So many allegories but none impactful or shocking. Its a disjointed effort for a superior story.. I wish David Fincher was one of the executive producers of this gem.."

The Forest,"As the French Say: ""Bof"" (""Meh"")","It seemed like the perfect binge-watch for a rest day, on many levels: first off, I wanted something ""dark, murderous, and set in the woods."" You know, like ""Hinterland"" or ""Trapped"" or ""The Tunnel"" or ""Marcella"" with a dash of ""Twin Peaks"" mixed in. Voilà, here comes this French murder-mystery, set in the woods in a small village near Belgium, where some young girls mysteriously disappear (I won't say more here). It fit the bill! Not only that...but yesterday, we happened to listen to a podcast centered around a true story about 18th-century disappearances of young women in the woods near their French village....so I was very excited for this show.

It wasn't to be. This review won't contain spoilers -- but the show does that all by itself! I knew what would happen before it happened. After every big ""reveal,"" I was saying, ""Ben, voilà"" and eye-rolling at the TV screen while working on other things. It wasn't really entertaining, and contained OH so many tropes of the genre: female detective who gets ""just a bit too involved""; head detective from another place, sent to the small town he's not used to; even a nod to Native American/forest mysticism (hence the ""Twin Peaks"" feel).

Anyway, maybe we've all had too much of a good thing and there aren't any more original, creative police procedurals to be made (but I hope it's not the case!). Watch this if you're folding laundry or sick and bored, and want something to pass the time. Just don't expect a ton from it."
The Forest,A french thriller circled around a beautiful village.,Comentario no disponible
The Forest,"And yet, another thriller about a Forest","A kid gets lost in a misterious forest and the whole town goes crazy about it, sounds familiar right? well, I am not here to compare The Forest with Stranger Things and Dark but after watching the trailer and reading the synopsis you could only expect that hopefully it isn't a straight copy of one or another. The show is moody and misterious from the beginning even the characters seem to have doubts about their own past, as soon as the show advances you will start asking alot of questions about the case, the characters, the hints? that they give you etc and that is what makes a good thriller.

Unlike Dark and ST it barely touches the supernatural but don't expect it to be irrelevant because as it goes you will get a lot of hints about that being important."
The Forest,Well-crafted Slow Burner,"This is a slow burner of a police procedural. But it's a pleasant surprise that this series is more than this.

The viewer has to be patient at the slow pace as Capt. Decker (Samuel Labarthe) and Virginie Musso pursue leads cautiously in the village that will lead to the killer.

Films, sometimes, have a viewers' pet peeve. In this film, one such character exists. And this is Virginie. There's no back story of Maya and Virginie that justifies why Virginie is so hysterical and frantic about the disappearance of Maya. It's understandable that mothers will react this way but her portrayal as the grieving, disconsolate mother is not convincing; it comes across as contrived.

This is also Eve Mendel's story. We root for her as she helps the police in their investigation, and when an important information about her past surfaces. The viewer hopes that her story will really have a happy ending.

Cinematography is splendid. The panoramic views of the wide expanse of the Ardennes are great. The locale (Montfaucon) is a quaint little town with a lovely river."
The Forest,Slow but captivating,"The show has a slow pace which adds to its charm. The gradual pace helps understand the character build up and the show keeps it eerie nature.

However, the show portrays the French police as one of the worst.

1. They regularly share case updates with the town folks.

2. They hide and manipulate/tamper with evidence to save their friends.

3. They let their emotions get in the way of police investigation.

4. They hide facts from their team.

5. They are not all prepared for serious situations. (One policeman was asked to watch over the killing scene, but he didn't have a gun. So, he forgets his sense of duty and starts running after someone approaches the location) 6. The police captain knows that the female detective is incompetent and unable to check her emotions, still he lets her continue with the investigation. I understand that she must be emotionally traumatised but that is not a reason to jeopardise the investigation."
The Forest,Crime drama as soap opera.,Comentario no disponible
The Forest,"A fun romp, but there were some werios issues","First of all we enjoyed the series. There was enough top keep us guessing. But in the end there were some serious flaws and gaps in the plot. First of all, the lieutenant should never be a cop. She is far too emotional and would never survuvce the hazing other cops would give her for her frequent hystrionics. Secondly, when the murderer is finally exposed, there are some issues with what was set up in earlier episodes that make the final reveal look like, ""Okay we are out of money, let's wrap this up."" Still, if you are looking for something to fill your time on a weekend and have Netflix, espceislly if your friends need subtitles in another language, it is worth checking out."
The Forest,The Forest - 'wood' you like to watch a great whodunit?,"The lead review at IMDb for this Netflix original says the acting is pretty good and the scenery terrific, but he couldn't get with the story. Au contraire, mon frère, the play is the thing. A pretty young blond girl rides her bike into the forest, and never comes back. The husband of one of the local gendarmarie's officers admits to an affair with the girl, but seems to alibi out. Two other recent abductions (plus two historical) seem to match the killer's style, but who could it be?

A new (and abrupt) Police Chief arrives to shake things up as the clues begin to pile up. Also, a mysterious young helper, the tall blond French Teacher (Eve) at the Lycée, assists greatly by showing up at the right time, and by searching in just the right places in the mysterious Ardennes Forest, which is one of the nominal stars of the 'cast.'. I don't think you could spot the killer, unless you made a lucky guess.

I thought the atmosphere, character development and plot were excellent. Having watched an Aussie mini series just prior, I also appreciated the general lack of skin and (needless) cuss words in this production, by comparison, which, I agree is not typical of French cinema. The other appeal is the length-just 6 episodes, with most of the final chapter a careful wrap up of the aftermath once they get the 'guy'. This series alone is worth the price of one month's subscription to Netflix. And I will keep scouring the listings for other decent 1 season miniseries in the 'mystery' genre."

Feria: The Darkest Light,Not the worst I've seen,The idea was there and overall the acting was good but the main character 'Sophia' was extremely frustrating to watch as she was just stupid and stroppy the whole way through. If she wouldn't have been so annoying I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more. The ending wasn't great either- wonder if there will be a season 2.
Feria: The Darkest Light,Perverting Gnosticism long after the Cathars have perished,"I love this kind of show, like Archive 81 another recent Netflix show. However this show tries to be a lot of things and the writing/script needs to be re-organized. It reveals too much too early by the time it reached the second half all the momentum is gone.

First half and second half feels like they are made by different people, first half has a lot of nudity and gore while the second half feels like Stranger Things.

Having said that I'll recommend this show if you like occult horror shows like Archive 81 and Paraiso/Paradise on HBO Max."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Use subtitles,"European occult / horror is hit and miss, usually a miss. This was one of the better recent ones. Audio dubbing is a bit awkward so if you can handle subtitles I'd suggest watching it that way.

This 8 episode isn't the usual burner and never drags and it's not as melodramatic as some of the Spanish ones are.

Cast work well together and scenery is really pleasant.

Having said that, you really don't care who lives and dies.

Plot isn't original, the old cult trying to open the door to another realm and others trying to stop it and police not being much help etc. But still it's definitely worth a watch if this is your genre."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Enjoyable mysterious show with fantasy elements,This show was entertaining and kept me watching. The story and mystery unfolds rather well although some 'sister drama' parts in the later episodes were a bit too long for my taste. The Spanish village and scenery are beautiful. This show gives a good insight in cult tactics and how people in agony are easily convinced into occult things using brainwashing. Won't spoil anything so I will just leave you with it's an enjoyable mystery show with a touch of fantasy.
Feria: The Darkest Light,It's OK,Comentario no disponible
Feria: The Darkest Light,I tried.,"I love Lovecraft, I love Spanish horror, and I need to practice my Spanish But I could not get past episode three.

TERRIBLE! Glacially slow, horrifically paced, and shot so badly that it looks like a bunch of black and white photographs,

Who cares about the cult? I was ready for everyone to die so the series would be over."
Feria: The Darkest Light,"Not the darkest or the lightest, somewhere in between","European settings always work great for mystery stories, especially during the 90s before everything turned global. Story here is about two sisters living in an isolated, conservative town that has a dark secret they keep for few decades. The story has potential and is interesting at times, even though not completely original. However, the acting leave a lot to be desired as the character don't act in a way that make a lot of sense and sometimes are overdramatic and over acting."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Worth your time,"I will not say that this is one of the best webseries on NetFlix. If you have watched all other good dark series than you can give it a try. If you have not till now than this series can wait. I found Series like Scream , Sinners better than this. But overall it is worth your time."
Feria: The Darkest Light,The devil made them do ... this series,"I'm 13' into episode three. Sigh. Repetitive, badly paced, Feria is a terribly written ghost story about a cult. The characters are unsympathetic, their actions make no sense, nor does the abundant nudity. Although there are dozens of cops lurking at every corner of this sleepy Spanish village, they don't seem to have a clue."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Starts well but disappoints episode after episode,"The plot is interesting and pretentious, but several caricatured performances, confusing script and bad effects leave the result far below expectations."
Feria: The Darkest Light,"Unrealized potential, 6 episodes too long","This series has all the things that make for a great movie. However it was also filled with unnecessary characters, superfluous subplots and lots of repetition, and this is the downfall.

This would have been just right as a two hour movie. But to stretch out into 8 episodes added nothing but excess, and wasted time.

I wanted to like this series but it is very slow and full of lose ends and other unnecessary nonsense which takes away from the creepiness factor. For every step the director took to create suspenseful horror, there were two steps back with all the ridiculous subplots and illogical scenes.

However, production value is decent and acting is good. Music is a little heavy and annoying at times. Writing and editing are bloated, and in need of a serious diet."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Feria: The Darkest Light,"As this '90s set Spanish series opens teenager Sofia goes out with a group of youngsters; while out she swims in the lake and passes out. She wakes up at home with Eva, her older sister; strangely their parents aren't there. Shortly afterwards the Guardia Civil come looking for their parents... it turns out that they seem to be linked to twenty three bodies being found at a disused mine. Investigations show that the dead were part of a cult that believes that this life is a fiction and had hoped to open a gateway to the real reality, which they call 'The Kingdom'. Surviving members of the cult start to take an interest in Sofia believing she may be able to open the gateway.

I rather enjoyed this series; it started well with a good sense of mystery concerning what happened at the mine. Early on it isn't entirely obvious whether, within the context of the series, the cult's beliefs are real or if they are just dangerously deluded. The fact that the mine contains dangerous gases means that some of the strange things we are shown could be the characters' hallucinations. Some of these scenes are nicely disturbing. The location, a fairly small remote town, is good and the nineties setting is good as it means middle aged characters can be affected by events that occurred at the end of the Franco dictatorship in 1975. The cast do a solid job bringing their characters to life and the special effects are really good. If you are bothered by on screen nudity you might not be a fan of this series as there is rather a lot... I can't think I've seen a TV series with more. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre I hope we get another season.

These comments are based on watching the series in Spanish with English subtitles."
Feria: The Darkest Light,"Cool monster designs, not much else","It is a fun watch for horror and scy-fi fans, but the story lacks something. It advances very slowly and explanations are a bit lacking. You end up just accepting what happens without understanding why.

The characters are believable for the most part, but I just couldn't get attached to them.

The monster designs are cool tho."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Very lazy writing,"It started out as a supernatural thriller with plenty of question... Then it veered, into a monster feature with a satanic kitty cat living in people's throat.

No mysteries after episode 3. You know who are the bad guys and what their plan his. You understand that they are all being manipulated.

The writers did not even follow the rules of their own univers... Elena grew up in the cult and wanted to go through the 4 initiation but it did not changed her.

While Sophia spent a few weeks in it then she does want to go through it but it completly changed her behavior ?!?

They said that only Dekta went through the Veil, but when they need another demon, Umma is magically there ?! Why ? How ?

The Temple/Mine is suppose to be filled with gaz that kills people, but only when it's convenient to the plot...

It's suppose to be based on Gnostism but they just used the names to put demons in the show.

It's simply poorly written..."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Those Mischievous Beings.,"Decent show. Took a while for them to tell us what was going on for sure. Though one could make early guesses. It wasn't clear for a while if we were dealing with evil of not. As usual it all comes together in the final episodes and satisfaction ensures.

However if a second series doesn't come about, it would be disappointing. Yes, a cliffhanger, but this isn't a new situation."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Great little show,"I found this series to be very entertaining, some points dragged on, but for the most past I couldn't stop watching. The plot along with the characters kept me engaged. I highly recommend and am looking forward to season two."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Lost opportunity......,"Feria could have been inspired. It starts out well with a novel story that's creepy, complex and atmospheric.

Regrettably, the story fails to pursue its complex story line and narrative. Its as if it simply runs out of breath, two thirds of the way through and gives up. What left is simplistic, inconclusive and annoying.

On the upside its well acted, with decent production values. CGI is only passable but does the job, so to speak.

In short, moderately watchable, well acted but ultimately truncated and somewhat frustrating.

5/10."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Nice work,Mosty over acting but story is good. There is no caracter who connect with audience. Graphic is good. Sometimes story is confusing so this is gone boring.
Feria: The Darkest Light,Wowww so bad,Talk about a lot of buildup for a completely anticlimactic ending. This show has so much potential and was just sooooo poorly executed. Total let down. Waste of time. Don't Bother getting into it as it will only disappoint.
Feria: The Darkest Light,"Not bad at all, worth the ""slow"" beginning","I think this series is quite more original than other supernatural series on Netflix.

The first episodes are a bit slow, maybe a bit too much drama for my taste. Definitely the last episodes have a lot more happening, and it is worth the wait.

The story is well written, intriguing and coherent. The acting is pretty good, the soundtrack is nice. I see the main negative comment is that the series is ""too slow"", unfortunately this kind of comment is more and more common as people have forgot to enjoy a good story and have too little patience for a story to develop, it seems."
Feria: The Darkest Light,The town was fabulous,"And that is it, hence 2 stars. You don't care at all for any of the characters. In fact most are really annoying. The story could have been more enjoyable with a better script, directing, acting...just a few things. BTW tons of full nudity so beware if you don't know that."
Feria: The Darkest Light,Hit and Miss,Comentario no disponible
Feria: The Darkest Light,Enter the Kingdom,"In the remote Andalusian Hills sits Feria-a seemingly pretty town bathed in the lovely Spanish light. But there is something deeply sinister at work here. Dozens turn up dead at a local mine seemingly the victim of a mass suicide linked to a cult and the daughters of the cult's alleged leaders are left to pick up the pieces...

Spanish horror has something of a pedigree and this delivers. Echoes of Lynch, Cronenberg and Lovecraft abound in this with added folk horror elements that will be right up the street of anyone following the likes of Stranger Things or Locke and Key."
Feria: The Darkest Light,"Was ok, worth the watch",The pacing is a little on the slow side and it took them awhile to get where they were going but overall I enjoyed it as it has a interesting story with good acting by the two playing the sisters. The series builds to a climatic moment and then ends... so hopefully there is a season two.

Ex-Shaman,A classic case of ethnocide,Comentario no disponible
Ex-Shaman,the story of an ethnocide,"The story of one of the thousands of indigenous tribes terrorized by Christian hordes and civilization. The film drags on a bit, following the life of the shaman Perper, who lived and hid in the Amazon jungle for years with his isolated group, until he was forced to convert to Christianity after the evangelical churches tracked him down and accused him of consorting with the devil. It is not a story from the time of Columbus, but the present, where bigotry and profiteering in Latin America are still flourishing, and even growing again. The aim of the director was to highlight the issue of ethnocide, which is relentlessly carried out by the contemporary Christian Inquisition."

Peaky Blinders,Loved It,Peaky Blinders is not only one of the most underrated TV shows of all-time but it's also one of the greatest shows of all-time. It's even better than all of the hype and love it gets as more and more people are watching it and loving it. It's quickly becoming one of the better shows ever created. If you want to see how loved this show really is all you have to do is read through some of the reviews or look at the ratings. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as great as the others. I just read they plan on doing a movie to end the show and I can't wait! If you haven't seen this amazing show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it immediately.
Peaky Blinders,Amazing,"Peaky Blinders is without a doubt one of my favorite tv shows of all-time. I wanted to watch this after seeing the trailers and then I heard so many people talking about how great this show was, literally everyone I know who saw it loved it so it raised my expectations even more. When a show is as loved as this one is it rarely lives up to the expectations. Well, Peaky Blinders not only met those expectations but surpassed them in every way possible. The acting and writing is what makes this show so special but the attention to detail they put into every aspect of this show is amazing. This series will hook you from the very first episode and hold on throughout the entire series. It just takes you into their world for you to enjoy. I can not recommend this show enough."
Peaky Blinders,One of the finest shows to have hit TV,"Peaky Blinders is one of those shows that grabs you and doesn't let go. The combination of gritty drama, incredible performances, and stunning cinematography makes it unforgettable.

Peaky Blinders,What happened to season 5?!,"Listen guys, I appreciate the contrast between the old setting and the modern styling, but come ooooon!

Season 5 just seems to have a complete lack of direction and content. It's like I'm constantly watching one movie trailer after another. All the characters seem to have lost their substance. Everyone is so overdramatic. They're all doing stupid things that make no sense and sometimes look so unbecoming of their character. Almost every scene is so dragged on to a point that they become boring. By the end of an episode I sometimes found if difficult to remember what it was about.

Again, I have nothing against using modern styling and music to contrast the series' grey, gritty, and dirty time period, but it's so overused in season 5 that it's difficult to stay emersed and follow the story. It all feels so diluted now, so cheesy. Too bad."

Peaky Blinders,One of the best shows I've ever seen,"This is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It's a show where you can't be playing on your phone, cooking dinner or doing something else, it requires your undivided attention. It's a show that never gets stale. I can't remember ever being bored, even for one episode. I loved every second of every episode and I think you will to if you give it a chance. The entire cast is fantastic, led by the incredible gifted Cillian Murphy (who just won an Oscar for best actor). I've already watched this show twice from beginning to end. The new season just started and I'm sure it'll be just as good as the first."
Peaky Blinders,The Shelby crime family,"Peaky Blinders"" has received critical acclaim for its storytelling, performances, and production values. Fans of crime dramas, historical fiction, and character-driven narratives are likely to enjoy the series for its engaging plot and memorable character.. It's very much intriguing. The show's plot is filled with twists, turns, and political intrigue as the Shelby family navigates rival gangs, law enforcement, and internal power struggles. The storytelling keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and leaves them eager for more. It is known for its distinctive visual style, including the iconic flat caps worn by the Shelby gang members. The show's cinematography, music choices, and editing contribute to its unique and stylish aesthetic."
Peaky Blinders,What brotherhood and family means to you??,"I watched every second of all six series of Peaky Blinders and at no point did I think: ""Wow. This would make a really good dance work!"" I don't believe Benoit Swan Pouffer did either. What I think happened is that the artistic director of Rambert was looking for a story that would extend his dance company's reach beyond the usual narratives, chanced upon the hugely popular saga of the violent Shelby family and thought: ""Aha!""

The resulting story, premiered to a hugely enthusiastic Birmingham audience, isn't bad. But never once does it feel felt or earned; it's all surface and no depth, a marketing person's fantasy, not an engaging work.

The opening promises more than it ultimately delivers. Tommy Shelby's first world war gang of tunnellers emerge on stage from down low, pulling themselves upright into a phalanx of the damaged, shoulders twitching, eyes wide. Natasha Chivers's lighting, moody and magnificent, surrounds them in swirls of yellowish smoke.

The one quality in Peaky Blinders that really does lend it to dance in the first place is the strength of its characters Then there's a voiceover, intoned by poet and series regular Benjamin Zephaniah: ""You young men of the tunnelling brigade, you are all dead ... condemned to a life without a soul."" And we're off into the heavy chains and falling sparks of the industrial landscape of the Black Country, dominated by a grotesque factory foreman and women whose sharp elbows and quick marching steps demonstrate how invaluable they've been to the country while the men are gone.

Peaky Blinders,"Brilliant at the start, but the last two seasons are unwatchable...","Peaky Blinders is the rare diamond of a TV show that has great writing, great casting, great cinematography and a brilliant use of music.

For the first 3 seasons, that is... Already at season 4 it begins to go down - the writing is weaker, the cinematography is becoming more standard TV style. But still watchable.

However season 5 loses everything that made this show great - the writing style is totally different than before, the pulse is gone, the dialogues are often weak. The music shifts to a totally depressive wailing style of mournful misery. Political propaganda is also shoved into the plot (along with a completely no-personality badguy in the form of real historic Fascist Mosely) Season 6 is simply unwatchable. Had the series begun like this it would have been cancelled after 3 episodes... Dark and gloomy, zero style in the horrible music and camera work, bad, weak dialogue - so bad in fact that long silent ugly dark ""sequences"" are used to kill time.

The remaining actors are still brilliant, but what can even Cillian Murphy do with such weak material? It feels like his scripts are just filled by the sentence ""long brooding look"". No logic, depressing, no artistic value. A stark contrast to the firey, brilliant and inspiring seasons at the start.

I just wonder how a show can spiral down like this? Who left, and who came in to mess it up?"
Peaky Blinders,Peaky Blinders Is TV History In The Making,"Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham.

The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.

Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.

If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre. Well done BBC."
Peaky Blinders,All round great show!,"If you like Victorian crime shows like Ripper Street, Whitechapel, Sherlock Holmes etc. then you will love this. There are two differences which make Peaky Blinders stand out. The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.

The cinematography is great, the storyline is great the only thing I would challenge is the accents. They sway in and out of the Birmingham accent but its a decent attempt and probably unnoticeable to anyone not from Birmingham. I've heard that they didn't want the accents too strong because it will be airing in the US. Anyhow...I'm loving it!"

Peaky Blinders,More music video than TV show,"Peaky Blinders is all style and no substance. Endless slow-motion shots to dramatic music of characters walking, smoking cigarettes, or squinting into the distance. The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core."
Peaky Blinders,"Incredible, Through and through.","Incredibly well made show top to bottom, Every character has their own complex personalities and layers throughout, Each one masterfully performed to the absolute highest degree. Every single scene in peaky blinders is crafted to be as good as possible thanks to the incredible writing and direction of Steven knight. Of course the main stars of the show are the cast, Thomas shelby (Portrayed by the Extraordinary Cillian murphy) has to be one of if not the best protagonist i have ever seen for a tv show. Cillian murphy truly puts on a performance of a lifetime as tommy shelby, a performance so well I truly cannot do it justice by writing this review. Not to mention the other all-star performances of the rest of the cast, Paul anderson as Arthur Shelby, Helen Mccroy (RIP) as Polly Grey, Sophie rundle as Ada, and Tom hardy as Alfie solomons (one of my favorite characters second to tommy shelby himself). The Cinematography and set pieces aswell are by far the BEST i have ever seen in any show by a country mile. Peaky blinders truly is a masterful show, written and acted to absolute perfection, Should be considered as a top 5 show of all time by everybody who loves television."
Peaky Blinders,HBO production quality levels,"I for one am a huge fan of this compelling series. A wonderful dark industrial landscape, great soundtrack, rich characters that have real depth played by quality actors, all to the tune of a great script and an interesting time line. You an clearly see the similarities with the high quality US series and they have gone for this market and there is clearly lots here that could make it a fantastic long running series.

Sadly, I am concerned that the BBC won't be able to retain the quality levels and we won't see it evolve in the way that the sopranos (yes I compare this show to the sopranos and boardwalk empire) evolved. Please push this internationally, let's keep it on our screens and see it develop. This period in UK history is rich with trauma, upheaval and change, the backdrop of industrial Birmingham is new and trumps the well trodden New York, Chicago, and London gangster scenes. For writers and producers this represents very fertile ground and allows innovative story lines to emerge.

Keep peaky blinders on our screens..... The campaign starts here!"

Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,What brotherhood and family means to you??,"I watched every second of all six series of Peaky Blinders and at no point did I think: ""Wow. This would make a really good dance work!"" I don't believe Benoit Swan Pouffer did either. What I think happened is that the artistic director of Rambert was looking for a story that would extend his dance company's reach beyond the usual narratives, chanced upon the hugely popular saga of the violent Shelby family and thought: ""Aha!""

The resulting story, premiered to a hugely enthusiastic Birmingham audience, isn't bad. But never once does it feel felt or earned; it's all surface and no depth, a marketing person's fantasy, not an engaging work.

The opening promises more than it ultimately delivers. Tommy Shelby's first world war gang of tunnellers emerge on stage from down low, pulling themselves upright into a phalanx of the damaged, shoulders twitching, eyes wide. Natasha Chivers's lighting, moody and magnificent, surrounds them in swirls of yellowish smoke.

The one quality in Peaky Blinders that really does lend it to dance in the first place is the strength of its characters Then there's a voiceover, intoned by poet and series regular Benjamin Zephaniah: ""You young men of the tunnelling brigade, you are all dead ... condemned to a life without a soul."" And we're off into the heavy chains and falling sparks of the industrial landscape of the Black Country, dominated by a grotesque factory foreman and women whose sharp elbows and quick marching steps demonstrate how invaluable they've been to the country while the men are gone.

Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,"Brilliant at the start, but the last two seasons are unwatchable...","Peaky Blinders is the rare diamond of a TV show that has great writing, great casting, great cinematography and a brilliant use of music.

For the first 3 seasons, that is... Already at season 4 it begins to go down - the writing is weaker, the cinematography is becoming more standard TV style. But still watchable.

However season 5 loses everything that made this show great - the writing style is totally different than before, the pulse is gone, the dialogues are often weak. The music shifts to a totally depressive wailing style of mournful misery. Political propaganda is also shoved into the plot (along with a completely no-personality badguy in the form of real historic Fascist Mosely) Season 6 is simply unwatchable. Had the series begun like this it would have been cancelled after 3 episodes... Dark and gloomy, zero style in the horrible music and camera work, bad, weak dialogue - so bad in fact that long silent ugly dark ""sequences"" are used to kill time.

The remaining actors are still brilliant, but what can even Cillian Murphy do with such weak material? It feels like his scripts are just filled by the sentence ""long brooding look"". No logic, depressing, no artistic value. A stark contrast to the firey, brilliant and inspiring seasons at the start.

I just wonder how a show can spiral down like this? Who left, and who came in to mess it up?"
Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,Peaky Blinders Is TV History In The Making,"Peaky Blinders is one of the most unique British dramas ever made. I would even go as far as to say TV history in the making. Negative critics of the show seem to have overlooked the fact that this is the first time ever that this side of British gangster-lore has been documented. Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham.

The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard. As is the quality of acting, which is undeniably as good as you'll find in any prime-time British drama.

Even though people on this particular forum have not had much positive feedback about the series, believe me, the connoisseurs of this genre have been very impressed thus far. Furthermore, the show seems to be building up to climatic ending rather than simply documenting a day in the life of a Peaky Blinder. The more observant viewers will see subtle 'tie-ins' between each situation and be able to follow the flow of events without obvious prediction. This is what the drama audience thrives on to stimulate analytical debate after each episode.

If it doesn't get rave reviews, I will be disappointed but not surprised, as Peaky Blinders has all the makings of an artistic and timeless cult series, possibly appealing more to purists and true fans of the cult/gangster genre. Well done BBC."
Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,All round great show!,"If you like Victorian crime shows like Ripper Street, Whitechapel, Sherlock Holmes etc. then you will love this. There are two differences which make Peaky Blinders stand out. The first is it isn't set in London. Why is this a good thing? It's a nice change of scene, change of accent and culture. Peaky Blinders give you a great sense of what Birmingham was like at the time. The second reason it stands out is it is told from the criminals point of view. You get a feeling of belonging to the Peaky Blinders and despite all the terrible acts they carry out there is a fundamental decency somewhere deep down in Thomas Shelby.

The cinematography is great, the storyline is great the only thing I would challenge is the accents. They sway in and out of the Birmingham accent but its a decent attempt and probably unnoticeable to anyone not from Birmingham. I've heard that they didn't want the accents too strong because it will be airing in the US. Anyhow...I'm loving it!"

Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,More music video than TV show,"Peaky Blinders is all style and no substance. Endless slow-motion shots to dramatic music of characters walking, smoking cigarettes, or squinting into the distance. The priority is clearly to make everyone look cool: cool when they're engaging in brutal violence, cool when they're suffering or dying, cool when they're eating breakfast. Every shot is either like a music video or a fashion magazine spread in period costume. The characters are props - lifeless mannequins. None of them feel like actual people, nor are they meant to. The actors here are all good, but they have nothing to do but pose. We're just supposed to be dazzled by how cool they look and sound. The fact that so many viewers seem to think this show is gritty and realistic is a depressing commentary on how on we as a society can no longer tell the difference between the fake and the authentic (and how little we care about the difference). This show and others of its ilk (like the even more popular Taboo) are just nihilism photoshopped to look sexy. Superficially seductive, empty at the core."
Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,"Incredible, Through and through.","Incredibly well made show top to bottom, Every character has their own complex personalities and layers throughout, Each one masterfully performed to the absolute highest degree. Every single scene in peaky blinders is crafted to be as good as possible thanks to the incredible writing and direction of Steven knight. Of course the main stars of the show are the cast, Thomas shelby (Portrayed by the Extraordinary Cillian murphy) has to be one of if not the best protagonist i have ever seen for a tv show. Cillian murphy truly puts on a performance of a lifetime as tommy shelby, a performance so well I truly cannot do it justice by writing this review. Not to mention the other all-star performances of the rest of the cast, Paul anderson as Arthur Shelby, Helen Mccroy (RIP) as Polly Grey, Sophie rundle as Ada, and Tom hardy as Alfie solomons (one of my favorite characters second to tommy shelby himself). The Cinematography and set pieces aswell are by far the BEST i have ever seen in any show by a country mile. Peaky blinders truly is a masterful show, written and acted to absolute perfection, Should be considered as a top 5 show of all time by everybody who loves television."
Motu Patlu Aur Khazaane Ki Race,HBO production quality levels,"I for one am a huge fan of this compelling series. A wonderful dark industrial landscape, great soundtrack, rich characters that have real depth played by quality actors, all to the tune of a great script and an interesting time line. You an clearly see the similarities with the high quality US series and they have gone for this market and there is clearly lots here that could make it a fantastic long running series.

Sadly, I am concerned that the BBC won't be able to retain the quality levels and we won't see it evolve in the way that the sopranos (yes I compare this show to the sopranos and boardwalk empire) evolved. Please push this internationally, let's keep it on our screens and see it develop. This period in UK history is rich with trauma, upheaval and change, the backdrop of industrial Birmingham is new and trumps the well trodden New York, Chicago, and London gangster scenes. For writers and producers this represents very fertile ground and allows innovative story lines to emerge.

Keep peaky blinders on our screens..... The campaign starts here!"

Baby Ballroom,Really charming kids,"Pretty wholesome show; it's like the good version of Toddlers & Tiaras. I don't find the parents pushy at all, they seem to be the right amount of supportive and loving. The kids seem balanced and well-mannered.

The kids steal the show, especially the younger ones. They are just so adorable and pure, and happen to be exceptionally talented. I agree with the other critique - I wish they would show longer shots of the dancing itself.

I love the third daughter, blazing her own trail to become an astronaut. I hope she makes it to the stars!

It's a shame how much makeup the girls cake on, though, even when not dancing. It's an unfortunate trend and doesn't look good and I legit thought one of the Mias was wearing blackface because the makeup was so dark.

I haven't watched the second season but I look forward to catching up with the Zig Zag fam and seeing how the kids have progressed."
Baby Ballroom,Beautiful dancing of the very young dancers,"I thought the series was very interesting because I had no idea such young children could dance so beautifully, and had these competitions that they really love. The girls' dresses are out of this world, so gorgeous! My only critique is that I wish they showed longer segments of the dancing and had less interruptions with people talking to the camera. Sometimes the camera moves around between the couples so fast you can't quite see enough of the dance moves. I'd like the camera to show an entire dance of one couple sometimes. Very impressed with the dancing skills of these young couples! I was amazed at the dedication of the students and the parents - driving hundreds of miles for practices and competitions. Warren and Jane appear very warm and encouraging and are also quite funny. I liked the show very much and please continue!"
Baby Ballroom,Surprisingly addictive!,"Much like children's baking competitions ""Baby Ballroom"" stars young kids with absolutely no filter and I love it. They say whatever they want, and they really mean it. I also thought it gave a closer look at the competitive world of kids ballroom dancing, the kiddies love it."
Baby Ballroom,Incredibly nice dancing show!,"A really cool documentary show about children's dance hobby! It's amazing to watch a show, where the coaches are normal and loving, not yelling at the children nor telling them they eat too much. Children are saying funny comments all the time and you can really see their real personalities. This is how all hobbies should be!"
Baby Ballroom,The ups and the downs.... the cheers and the tears....,"(updated & edited 11/21/18) At first I didn't think I'd enjoy this show, and passed by it numerous times, mostly because I don't tend to enjoy reality shows. But once I did decide to watch this, I was pleasantly surprised. I loved watching the kids dancing and learning. it really wasn't much different from the parents and the kids who play other sports and activities, like baseball, football, cheerleading, hockey, etc There are always some parents who are more involved, perhaps a little louder than the rest, and take the activity very seriously... especially if they are investing a lot of time and money. Even though some of the parents appeared to be a little more overbearing than others, none of the kids seemed to be negatively affected by the pressure. In fact, they took the criticism and basically moved on. And yes... some might look upset at the moment, but that's part of the sport if you want to be champion. And while watching this show, I had no doubt that each child, criticism or not, loved what they were doing. I recall at one point, after a particularly 'strong' and critical verbal lashing from his dad, Max was asked about his take on that. For an eleven year old, his response was very mature. He basically said, and please don't quote me.... that it was all a part of this activity. He said that his father wanted him to succeed .... and that his dad did it because he loved him and wanted him to be a Champion. And Max added that HE wanted to be a champion too. (to Max's parents: Max seems to be a good kid and a good dancer. You two have done a good job both with parenting and teaching him dance. Not an easy task).

I love this show cannot wait for additional episodes to be added! I don't get regular TV, but I watch Baby Ballroom on Netflix, so I am anxiously waiting for Season 3. Thank you to the kids and parents for letting us take a somewhat honest peek into your ballroom, and sometimes private lives. I'm sure that it wasn't easy being followed around by a camera crew. And much thanks to Jane and Warren for allowing us to see the ups and the downs... the cheers and tears...which is the reality of any competitive activity. Also... thank you.... to you and your three lovely daughters who allowed us to see their passions, on and off the ballroom floor. It was obvious that there was genuine love, talent, and caring in your family. The very best of luck to all of you!

from NY, USA

PS..... Thank you Warren for responding to the one negative review here. I wanted to as well, but was afraid that it might come out as a negative review of their negative review, and we wouldn't want that to happen! You did a fine job."
Baby Ballroom,Chippendales and Baby Ballroom cannot coexist !,"Safe 2022 to all readers. I'm in the process of viewing the full series of BABY BALLROOM for a second time. And for this second time, I once again felt outrage when reaching Season 1, Episode 8, 31 : 40.

Coach Warren, husband and father, was given the O. K. by his wife Jane, mother of the triplets, to explore and display his very discernable homosexual fantasies.

The Ballroom couple's private life is none of my business, but when Warren chooses to bring half-naked body builders in golden bikinis to the school's fiesta, there's something VERY WRONG ! Some of the youngest attendees were four years old and a few parents expressed their discomfort.

So Warren, can't stay in the closet all the time ? Talk to Jane. BUT don't you bring minor children/students in contact with your world of painted musclemen in tiny bikinis ! Morally wrong is not even a strong enough expression to express my sentiment.

Perhaps a future episode will see Warren bringing the young dancers to a strip club ? I hope you get my point. Had I been one of the fathers at Warren's fantasy, it would have been the last time... Be safe."
Baby Ballroom,Must watch!,I just love this show! And I fell in love with Warren a long the way. Because he is such a great and sweet teacher for his students. And the kids really have fun and love what they do. It made me happy
Baby Ballroom,What a way to teach children that trophies are everything,"At first I really enjoyed this show. It was entertaining to watch children and their parents doing what they like and being supported by that.

However, when I saw what was really going on, how parents were pushing their children, never being satisfied by what their children are doing. The children think that they only have dancing and are nothing else. It is just beyond stupid. The pressure and the idea that you are only good at what you are doing by winning trophies, its just stupid. I dont have other words to describe this.

Also, the way the owner of that studio treats everyone in his family, is just abusive. Calling his wife fat, bashing everyone around him, being bossy and pitty and pushing children to become winning robots. My goodness what does winning even mean to them??? what a sad life this man has. I also just think that he might be a closeted gay man, who cant come out because he already has a family.

Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way is, that the producers of this show made the third non dancer daughter look like a freak. She is quite the interesting girl, but watching the show, you d think she is delusional. Get a grip people!"

Shameless,Loved This Show!,Comentario no disponible
Shameless,I miss it!,"I've loved Shameless ever since the beginning of Season 1 and now that it's over I really miss even though it was probably time for it to end! While it was still worth watching, it just wasn't the same once Emmy Rossum left. Shameless was such a great show for such a long time that it was hard to say goodbye...I miss it!"
Shameless,Keep Watching,"I have never watched the British version of this show so I cannot comment on the original. I was under the impression it was a new Showtime story.

I have to admit that started watching because I have always been a fan of William H Macy. However, viewing Macy in this kind of role was startling . I had always seen him in more conventional-almost typecast - parts. I knew that Joan Cusak was a quality actress which lent the project some further credibility.

At first the show seemed to be almost forced. The plot seemed bizarre, and unbelievable. It seemed awkward. Its quite common for shows to take time to develop chemistry when the actors haven't defined their characters yet. The same can be said for the writers.

However, I had never seen anything like it. In that regard it was dynamic and worth the time. The young actors soon found their roles and by the 5th episode I found myself thinking about the show every day.

Now I cant stop watching. Im addicted. The actors are fantastic. The plots are far more developed. The supporting players play a big part in the series, and new characters keep rotating in flawlessly. The show has evolved .

And just for the record, Im getting really sick and tired of people trashing the show because in their minds it doesn't measure up to the original. Its not supposed to be the original. If you don't like it, stick with the British show."
Shameless,A triumph of American television,"I've grown up with the original Shameless. It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.

Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.

The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.

The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.

No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.

As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.

Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for."
Shameless,This is the best exemple of how to ruin a show in just 2 seasons.,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Shameless, that's why i gave it a 9, it could have been a classic but they literally ruined it with the last 2 seasons. If you want to watch the most succesful show of Showtime, do yourself a favor and ignore the last two seasons. It's a shame a show like this has a writting for the ending seasons.."
Shameless,HILARIOUS except...,"One of the funniest shows ever. But like someone wrote before this, season 11 and 10 are SOOO BAD. 10 had some emotional moments but besides that no. And 11 is hard to watch. Like I have to force myself to watch the weekly episodes. I'm only watching them to say I've seen all the seasons."
Shameless,I've seen both. The American is better. (But not by a lot),"I was halfway through the American series before I even KNEW there was a British series. I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. ""I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!""

Once I finished the American series, I gave it about a month to settle in and then started watching the British series. But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.

Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.

So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...

Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???

Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.

Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre.

Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.

Kevin: Dead heat.

Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.

Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.

Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him. I feel like I'm laughing at someone who's mentally challenged."
Shameless,Loved the British Original...US version tops it,"I've followed the original version in the UK since it started and it's still going strong (to correct an earlier reviewer it wasn't aired on the BBC, it's a Channel Four series). I therefore approached this with apprehension. To take a loved UK program and set it in the US has a history of failures but I liked the look of the trailer and gave it a go. I have to admit that throughout the first episode I was constantly thinking 'oh she's not as good as so and so' or 'I much prefer David to William'. However there was a lot packed into that episode and the script was pretty good. Come episode two I was hooked and to honest much prefer this version.

It has cleverly achieved what the UK version has in taking a subject and a group of characters that most people should loathe and turned them into a lovable group, all beautifully portrayed. Real, rounded, believable characters and so many of them too. Many people will have been turned off this by the trailer and thought it's not for them which is a shame. It really is extremely well written with great pace and some superb performances. I love Emmy Rossum and her portrayal of Fiona is astounding. I agree that William H Macy's Frank is more likable since he isn't always drunk and Joan Cusack is perfect as Sheila (I found the UK Sheila quite annoying).

We are only up to episode 7 of the US series here in the UK and its top of my weekly viewing. Great to see they are making a second series in the US and in fact given they have plenty of material to use, since we are up to Series 8 here in the UK, I hope it has the same longevity."

Shameless,Good show should have ended years ago,Comentario no disponible
Shameless,"Fluid direction, crisp script, helmed by trio of fine performances","Note: I have not seen the UK version.

I wasn't sure what to make of the first episode of Shameless. I wasn't sold on the characters and the direction seemed directionless. In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life.

While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities.

Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.

In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.

The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show. Whether the writing and direction can sustain this level of quality over a season we don't know. What we do have for now is some of the best ensemble acting you will see on TV or on film."
Shameless,Time to pull the plug on this show,"The first few seasons of Shameless was very entertaining and enjoyable, but it slowly lost its fire. By the end of season 9 I wasn't sure I wanted to watch season 10. Well after 2 episodes I couldn't handle it anymore. The writing is terrible and the characters suck. I know that several scenes were meant to be funny but there was no humor in the writing or the delivery.

I agree that they write with a political agenda and it's not whether I agree or disagree but more importantly I tune into shows to escape from that BS. I wish Hollywood will learn that when a series becomes successful, follow the path that got them there and keep the political dialogue for the cable news stations.

Good-bye Shameless."

Shameless,Why??,"I have loved this show for 10 years, but season 11 sucks! I don't even know what to say about it. Apparently the writers think the show is over because all they can do is compile scenes from previous episodes. There have been a couple of eps that were really interesting and moved the story along, but that's all. Shame on the writers for letting down their loyal fans."
Shameless,Loved the series. Hated the ending.,"""Shameless"" is a unique series that doesn't mince words.

The characters in the series are brilliantly written and really grow on you over time, no matter what big jerks they are.

The series is also incredibly funny, but also incredibly sad at times.

In addition, two excellent actors were produced here with Cameron Monaghan and Jeremy Allen White, who both hopefully still have a huge career ahead of them.

But the ending was unfortunately one of the worst I've ever seen and doesn't fit into the usual scheme of the series at all.

Therefore unfortunately no 10 points.

Nevertheless, it's definitely worth seeing if you feel like watching a longer series that you can get used to."
Shameless,Lost its sauce,"I like many am an avid fan of shameless since it kicked off many years ago. I was never into comedy/drama's but this show changed that perspective within the first season. It took nearly 4 months to bring myself to watch season 9 due to the poor ratings and season 8 being abit plants aswell. The Irishman? What a bore, along with the whole gay thing, you just say to yourself, MOVE ON ALREADY! season 9 is how most are saying. Average at best. I only watched it as I was stuck for things to watch. There's maybe 2 good episodes. Needs alot of spice to get it back the how brilliant it used to be"
Shameless,Awesome Show,"I don't leave reviews very often but I had to for this show. I have not seen the UK version and don't really care to because this show is just top notch. I had never heard of this show since I work overseas but ended up catching the 5th episode and absolutely loved it. I told all of the guys in the fire station about it and ever since we have had to catch up on all of the previous episodes. Everyone in the department loves this show and that is a hard thing to do. All of the characters are just great and have so many flaws. William H. Macy does an awesome job as the dysfunctional father. I gave it the highest review I think a show can receive because I don't think there is a perfect show, but this comes darn close. I definitely recommend this show."
Shameless,For those who've never seen the original,"Many of the reviews on here are complaining about how much the U.S. version copies the original. I've not seen a single episode of the original and, to me, the U.S. version is well acted, entertaining and perhaps one of my new favorites. I could care less that it's word for word from the original because this is all new to me. The actors portray the characters amazingly and I feel the storyline represents struggling families realistically. Each character will remind you of someone you know or have known. So for those who are like me and you've never seen the original, I absolutely suggest checking out Shameless, the U.S. remake. I look forward to seeing the rest of the season and maybe one day I'll even check out the original."
Shameless,Great show!!!,"Just finished binge watching Shameless and I absolutely loved it. The acting was amazing, especially from William H. Macey! If you're easily offended, don't like dark humor and don't like soft porn, don't watch it lol. You really get to know all the characters. You grow from liking a character to wanting to slap them......and then you like them again. I loved seeing cameos from people I know from other shows to. My favorite characters will and always will be Lip and Kevin. I know, I know but, I have my reasons. Y'all definitely need to watch this show if you haven't already, you will not regret it."
Shameless,Last season HORRIBLE,"I am in shock as to the degree they have ruined this show. Literally EVERY scene in the last season is some absurd liberal talking point. Every scene. The propaganda is so strong, I cannot even watch it anymore, and I was a pretty big fan. Absolute garbage. Awful writing. I would be surprised if anyone can actually sit through the last season, because I had to turn it off it was so ridiculous."
Shameless,Great Cast and Great Plot,"I'll start by saying that if you have watched the UK version of this (Which by the way was made by Channel 4 and Company Pictures and NOT the BBC as these other reviews suggest) You probably won't enjoy this first episode. Its a straight transition of the script with some adjustments.

However having seen shows that were changed beyond all recognition I can say that is a good thing.

The cast are excellent in their roles and the story which is far from the usual tame fodder of American drama is handled with honesty and realism. The characters mostly have their own interests to consider as well as the kids trying to keep their family together.

William H Macy is ideal in a role which doesn't allow him much initial screen time but I'm sure future episodes will focus on him since Frank is such a fascinating character. Can't wait for episode 2."
Shameless,Another Victim of Politicizing Comedy After Great Beginnings,"The series begin great, one of the funniest series I had seen in a long while at that time, and good comedy is difficult to come by. It truly lived up to its name, providing cringe-worthy humor, and yet also seamlessly combining it with a meaningful drama that few other series have ever been able to pull off.

This continues for the first few seasons, with the typical ups and downs, some story arcs of the characters being more interesting than others, which is expected in any series with as many memorable characters.

Since the shift begin in the political climate, the series decided to shift in the same direction, and is suffering greatly because of it. What used to be apolitical, or rather distributing it evenly with good spirited humor, has turned the way of so many and simply become a new political cudgel. It takes quite obvious stances on political issues, and rams it down your throat, trying to make a message that was neither needed or asked for, and is not even in the spirit of comedy. It is simply there. Entire episodes and story arcs, that have no comedy in them whatsoever and are there simply trying to make a statement. The comedy that they do attempt with it is the nasty mean-spirited kind of ""humor"" that is not funny, but is simply insults without intelligence attempting to hide behind the mask of comedy.

So unfortunately the series is going down hill at a break-neck pace, and likely nothing is going to save it now, especially with the loss of the central character. Alienating half of your viewer-base with in-your-face-political-statements is not exactly a good tactic for ratings, so it will reap what it sowed."
Shameless,The writing has just gotten terrible,Comentario no disponible
Shameless,not as bad as you think it is.,"I cant seem to understand the hate for the American version, i am a huge fan of the Original series, actually the preview for this got me into the original series! after watching the pilot of this, i can say its gonna be good, and its something America needs, besides another ""reality series"" whether you're watching the original or American remake its still a good show. however there are a few things changed in the American remake and they are very subtle changes, like Ian being interested in the military and Liam being black, those are the only huge changes. there were allot of drastic changes made to the original series which made it much better, such as getting rid of some characters and adding a bunch of new ones. lets just hope this remakes gets to live 7 seasons."
Shameless,Pretty damn good for an American remake,"the original British version is one of my favourite shows on TV and when i first heard that they were remaking it in the states, i like many others had serious doubts of it translating well, especially if you think of how glamorous American TV is and how unglamourous a show like shameless is. However i can safely say that John Wells and Showtime really have nailed it in adapting the show for the US audience. this can be said with how successful the show has been in America, which is great because it sort of mimics the same success the UK version had when it debuted in 2004. Despite there being some flaws, Showtime have overall done a terrific job in adapting shameless.

while the story lines for the first season are pretty much americanised versions of the first series of the British version, there are several episodes that have there own story lines and the whole of season 2 completely deviates from the British story lines, in fact while watching season 2, the show felt more of a completely different show rather than a remake. the acting from everyone is very good, especially from Emmy Rossum, Joan cusack and William Macy. the story lines that the US writing team come up with are generally very inventive and have that same tongue and cheek humour that the British series has. the chemistry between Lip and Ian as well as Fiona and Steve is one of the strongest aspects of the show. the music is also great and fits into the show well.

Now i am going to talk about the flaws of the show. even though i am from the UK and am not entirely familiar with American culture and how people live, there doesn't seem to be that much poverty to the show. the show just seems to be too glamorous and clean as opposed to the grittiness of the original UK version. another problem i have is William Macy as Frank. to me, David Threlfall IS Frank and while Macy isn't bad in the role, he just doesn't have that same quality that Threlfall delivers in the UK version. many fans of the UK version may also find the deviations in this version to be quite off-putting.

Overall, do i prefer this version to the original? the answer is No, i don't. while the acting, the story lines, the music and the overall feel to the show is great, this version just doesn't have the same spark as the original one has and i can also relate to the UK one more. if you are a fan of the UK version, you may find this remake hard to enjoy, however if you are able to ignore the fact that it is based on a British show and treat it as an entirely different show altogether, Shameless USA can be a very fun and entertaining show. if your American and haven't seen either version, then you probably will enjoy the US version more than the UK version."

Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Power flows from barrel of the gun!,"Very well made. Bihar of 90s and 2000s was a unique place - mafia, politicians and police often coalesced in each others territory. Some Criminals were hailed as robinhoods while at times police hardly put up any resistance to criminals and extortionists.

The sentiment of Bihar of those years has been succinctly captured in this series. Ashutosh Rana, Anoop Soni, Ravi Kishan & Karan Tacker have done parts very well.

Well researched series. Kumar sanu lives on in hearts and minds of people in interior of Bihar. Till date, it's impossible to cross any 'gumti/auto/condiments shop etc without hearing Kumar sanu's voice blaring saajan, phool or kaante,aashiqui songs. The references to casteist equation is hard to miss and has been quintessential to Bihar politics. Language, diction, slangs in series very well mirrors how majority of Biharis communicate.

Gangs of Wasseypur was released 10 years ago but the glass ceiling it broke, the unchartered territory it opened to stories like these from badlands & hinterland to be shown to pan India audience - will be permanently indebted to it.

Khakee - the Bihar chapter is a well made,damn good series. Shouldn't be missed!"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,"Brilliant, indigenous, rugged and rustic India series!","A very good series! Must watch. Always believed in this from the start by just looking at the name Neeraj Pandey. But the series was very promising at every aspect. The casting and their acting, screenplay, background music, Bihari locations was top notch. This is one of the top Indian series on my list after Mirzapur, family man etc; The story/plot might be known from before but the way it was directed and displayed was very unique, stylish and also entertaining. You will want to watch the next episode with utmost curiosity every time. Mature acting by the leads, especially the antagonist was the best. He made me hate him, which for any antagonist is the goal. Must watch!! Recommended to everyone."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Characters nailed it,"From the starting point to the last, the series didn't felt like it was not real. Yeah the series is not flawless, sometimes the lead 'Karan Tacker' seems like a Super Cop'. But the scenes shown in the film looks real. The village scenes, Deoghar Kanwariya Scenes, Ruthless murder scenes and the village ballads in a marriage, everything makes it a visual spectacle. Moreover, the performance from Avinash Tiwary made it a more spectacle. Avinash Tiwary, what an actor he is, he made the audience to feel hatred for his character,and that's the biggest quality of an actor. Every supporting actors did very well. Karan Tacker as a lead did decently well. Till the last ,you would think that why the Police didn't encounter Chandan Mahto, but the climax satisfy us, and did Justice to the reality. Overall its an interesting watch for all, can watch with the family.4.2/5."

Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Slow Burn,"Never imagined a crime show based on infamous Bihar goondaraj can ever be directed, presented and narrated in such fashion. It's unlike any other Bihar based shows that one has ever seen. And by that I don't mean previously all Bihar based shows or movies were never authentic. Of course, there are many. When I say unlike, I mean in a slow burn way that has never been shown before.

It's your typical story but does it take you on wonderful journey of hinterland and touches the very core of every day Bihar? Oh, boy yes. An emphatic win for all involved from writers to actors but I personally would give all the credit to the Director and cinematographer of the series.

Ye ""main"" nahi kehta ""hum"" kehte hain, zaroor dekhiye iss series ko."

Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Thok Denge Katta Kapaar Mein... Aaiyee Na Hamra Bihar Mein... A Neeraj Pandey Special !!!,"Created by Neeraj Pandey 'Khakee: The Bihar Chapter' is based on IPS officer's Amit Lodha's book, 'Bihar Diaries - The true story of how Bihar's most dangerous criminal was caught.' and is set between the years 2000-2006. Inspired by true events, the series follows two journeys simultaneously - one, that of IPS officer Amit Lodha's (Karan Tacker) series of postings across Bihar and the other of Chandan Mahto's (Avinash Tiwary) rise from an unassuming truck driver to a dreaded gangster in the state.

Spread across 7 episodes, the series doles out a heady mix of crime, corruption, drama and action. Director Bhav Dhulia and writer Umashankar Singh ensure that each episode builds on the previous one, keeping a tight leash on the narrative.

Early in the series, when a newly married Amit Lodha along with his wife Tanu (Nikita Dutta) is on the train to his first posting in the Bihar cadre, a co-passenger advises him, ""Bihar ka apna lay aur apna taal hai,"" . Words, he truly understands on his very first day, when the SSP Mukteshwar Choubey (Ashutosh Rana) sends him off to a nearby village to temper down angry villagers who have stopped a train to Delhi in its tracks, telling him to use brute force if necessary. Once there, Amit realizes it's a tight rope he has to balance on and intricately negotiates his way to resolve the situation. It's this ability to use his presence of mind without compromising on his ideals that holds him in good stead at various stages of his career. Amit, an IIT graduate chose to join the civil services and especially IPS because he wants to bring about social change.

As his next posting takes him to Patna a parallel track takes us 120 kms away from the city to Sheikhpura, where an impoverished Chandan Mahto (Avinash Tiwary) is hired as a truck driver and is soon transferring illicit alcohol for his employer in the trucks meant for cement. Looking to make a few extra bucks, Chandan surreptitiously uses the truck to help in a high-profile kidnapping of a child from school. Amit Lodha, now among the best in the Bihar police is appointed to rescue the child. While a nervous Chandan manages to escape this police raid where all the kidnappers are killed, this is his first brush with guns. And he realizes the power one yields by just holding it. A series of events then leads him to Abhyuday Singh (Ravi Kishan), a local goon which sets him off on his next course. Chandan Mahto joins Abhyuday Singh's gang and soon becomes one of his most trusted aides. Abhyuday Singh's brother Lohu Singh is a Member of Parliament and as the Bihar Assembly Elections draw close political violence takes the front seat in the state. And in a clash between rival political parties Abhyuday Singh's gang including Chandan Mahto end up killing five men from the Yadav community. It springs up a caste tussle and Amit Lodha is under immense pressure to jail Abhyuday Singh and his men. In fact at one point, his senior Mukteshwar Choubey, advises him to 'clear the status of his caste', so as to not seem partial towards any particular community.

Caste divisions form a strong undercurrent in 'Khakee' - The Bihar Chapter'. It is most apparent when Abhyuday Singh expects Chandan Mahto to take the blame for all the five murders committed by his gang. Feeling betrayed, Chandan finds a strong support in his new found friend, Chawanprash Sahu (Jatin Sarna) and his wife Meeta Devi (Aishwarya Sushmita) in the Nawada prison. And then there is no turning back for him. As Chandan's clout as a gangster grows so do his menacing deeds. But it is around the same time that Amit Lodha is shunted from his position owing to his upright ways where he refuses to lean towards any political party. It is only when Chandan Mahto's gang conducts a horrific massacre in Manikpur village in Sheikhpura, that Amit Lodha is asked to report back to duty and arrest Chandan Mahto at any cost. Coming out of a bleak period in his career it is a challenge Amit Lodha takes on reluctantly, unsure if he is being purposely set up for failure. But his biggest cheerleaders are his wife, Tanu and DIG Paswan (Anup Soni).

The narrative is told through the eyes of Ranjan Kumar (Abhimanyu Singh), SHO at Sheikhpura as he takes us through the build-up and a riveting final clash between the two. And also contextualising the political rivalries, caste wars, betrayals and violence which visually never get too gory or bloody but are enough to drive home the point. Akin to a cop drama there are well executed action packed scenes and nail biting chase sequences (Action director - Abbas Ali Moghul). Add to that a gripping, taut screenplay with crisp editing (Praveen Kathikuloth) and superb use of music (Advait Nemelkar) that keeps the viewer hooked all through. The cinematography (Hari Nair, ISC) does well to capture the lush green expanses of Bihar as the show traverses through its political and criminal landscape and retaining the very real and rustic feel.

Yet it's the ensemble cast that shines through - Kudos to the casting (Vicky Sidana), that not a character feels out of place. From Ravi Kishan to Anup Soni, Bharat Jha, Nikita Dutta, Abhimanyu Singh, Shraddha Das pull in commendable performances. Jiten Sarna and Aishwarya Sushmita are remarkable as the Chawanprash and Meeta Devi. Karan Tacker is crackling as IPS officer Amit Lodha, bringing the perfect blend of a level headed, action oriented cop. Ashutosh Rana is a delight to watch as the one carefully playing the balancing act. But it is Avinash Tiwary who steals the show with a searing performance and an arresting screen presence as Chandan Mahto. Transforming himself at every stage to show the progression of Mahto's character Tiwary is simply brilliant.

Khakee- The Bihar Chapter is a slickly made, riveting thriller which certainly could be your weekend binge - watch."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Must watch web series,"If you are wanted to watch a good web series, full of thrill, suspense and with a realistic cinematography then it is perfect for you. No Bollywood drama, no unnecessary adult scene just amazing. You can watch with your family also. Neeraj Sir 😊🙌 hats off to you. Entire starcast was did a great job. Especially The character of Amit Lodha and Ranjan are best. The story of web series is based on the crime and politics of Bihar in background of 2000-2006. The series shows an IPS Officer's journey form probation period to became a super cop of Bihar. I have never comment on any movie or web series earlier but today bound to write."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Family Watch Series After a long time...,"The real story ! Do not expect too much of action and drama, but everything are in perfect ingredients... very well acted by every actor! No use of adult content and bad words which these days series think as a pride to add the exclusive content which targets only a set of audience. Good job by neeraj pandey and all the technicians who worked on this project. Many of us didn't know about the massacres in bihar state. Power creates and destroys whenever it's needed but always the common people suffer with the elements emerged from it or by it. All family together can watch this series that's one of the best thing about this one. Hoping for more seasons in the same way."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,What is it with the very filmi drama?,"Well, this show promised a lot with its synopsis. Gritty political police drama. But it definitely belongs to Bollywood style singham type of movie! What is it with the loud hero-entry music? I'm sure the makers wanted it to look gritty. But to me it was highly pretentious and silly. The main actor protagonist could have been chosen better. He looks too chocolate boy if you ask me. Avinash Tiwary looks and acts as competently as ever. Ashutosh Rana is good. The guy playing the main person is the weakest link of the series. I couldn't go beyond the first episode. Just found the music too intrusive and silly. Guys, how about a little more subtlety in filmmaking?"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,"When its Neeraj Pandey, feel happy about the quality of the entertainment","Created by Neeraj Pandey, this series shines. Very well plotted, with excellent performance by most of the actors, every episode pulsates with action. Indians are very well aware of the dirty politics and that too the sickening reach politics has in Bihar, India's most backward state. The series tries to establish the fact that politicians can drop down to any level to be in the limelight. Karan Tacker as SP Amit Lodha, sizzles with his performance. Equally,Avinash Tiwari as the hard core criminal Chandan Manto does justice to his meaty role. Apart from these two, all other characters act very well, Looking forward to the Second Season."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,"Brilliant, But With A bit of Dishonesty/Uneasiness?","As many watchers of the series, I felt the brilliance of this unique Police-Gangster drama, where there is a little bit of sympathy and heart for the fightback from the backward class or the Have-nots of the society.

But, I felt the need to research a bit more about the real story like many f us, i guess. After some research, I realized that much of it was mingled and fictionalized for creative, dramatic or other purposes.

However, finally I felt the series has the balance shifted against the Have-nots a bit, in spirit as well as script.

And the questions I got are these: Can such a film be possible against the atrocities of Powerful communities, which there are many? Is there political backing for this particular drama to stir up the politics in Bihar, possibly to advantage some? There are many bureaucrats who have powerful stories and went against the government in one way or the other, but none of them could get a powerful stage like this particular officer, Why?"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,A cold play,"Sameer lodaya

The series is a cold play as it missed the required aggression

The series is a adoption from the book Bihar diaries showcasing the case diary of Bihar gangster Chandan and SP amit..now here the main lead is karan tacker from special ops he definitely played his debut main character very well but the aggression was missing which was the directors glitch his entry was such a cold one as IPS..Avinash was game changer he played tremendous role of a villain..nikita lost her charm by playing a simple girl and a mother

The series is in 7 long episodes where the required pace was missing in line with the content...the series needed bad words , bold scenes, brutality, tangy dialogues and thump of police as all this excepted from Friday fireworks who are the masters in these types of content.

The series reminds the movie gangajal where many scenes and some contents were identical."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Hands down one of the best ever Cop vs Criminal story.,"Just finished watching this , this kind of production comes out very rarely. It's simply excellent. The acting of the cop , the important villain , the emotion , the story - everything is absolutely amazing. Don't want to write anything more but I think written enough to request you to watch this. This will go down as one of Netflix India's best series. No matter what comes in the next installment , this one will be remembered.

And special mention for the role of Chandan Mahato, the character development is unparalleled. So set some good 6-7 hours aside , have your fav drink and enjoy this fine creation."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Taking Indian shows and cinema to another level,"God level casting and dialogues Extremely good cinematography Music was exceptionally good We need more bihar crime thrillers There are many stories of bihar jharkhand and up that will give you goosebumps.

I personally think that indian storytells need to visit bihar travelling in general boggy of trains to gain experience stories that you will never get in any other cities in India I really request indian filmakers and storytellers to please visit bihar and show the world the stories from bihar.

Bihar is just a place full of stories.

I can vouch for whoever knows bihar politics can rule india."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Avinash Tiwary - A perfect example of an underused TALENT in bollywood.,"Brilliant. Avinash Tiwary just blew my mind. One of a few brilliant actors in Indian Cinema today.

Amazing story, impeccable direction, outstanding acting (not just the lead actors but also all tje supporting cast). Great casting. So good to see so many talented actors in one frame.

Everything was spot on from the shooting locations to the accent to the authenticity of the characters. I haven't seen a better show or a movie with such a real Bihari accent.

I was raised in Bihar and was at DPS patna then until 2003. So I know exactly what happened then. Everything was spot on. Last but not the least, BRILLIANT !!"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Intense watch,"Characters, acting, local language, caste system all defined to perfection. What an amazing watch. Every character is well defined, no over acting at all. They have shown Bihar in a very precise way. The local language, merciless killings, politics and the corruption.

Very decent Acting by all the characters.. Each characters played admirably by amazing actors and In this hall of fame, Actor cast for Chandan mahto Avinash Tiwari was brilliant also main lead Karan as Amit Lodha was outstanding, very convincing as a cop Nikita very beautiful and delightful on screen, Ashutosh Rana and Abhimanyu Singh Superb acting by these great actors All other characters done decent job Over all it's a really good watch."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,OOT (CAMEL) KI CHORI JHUKE JHUKE NAHI KAR SAKTE !!,"Superb script and reality depicted !!

Life and challanges of an Ips officer depicted with a pinch of bihari comedy. All actors are worth their salt. Police and politician nexus depicted correctly. Every upsc aspirant must watch . Life is not so green on the other side. Bureauract has diffrent challanges and epic solutiona to them .

Chandan mahto , the dredged criminal acted brilliantly and did justice to the role.

10/10 SUPERB MUST WATCH SERIES.

AFTER LONG TIME NETFLIX GOT 10/10 WITH A CRIME GENRE.

WASSEYPUR AND MIRZAPUR TYPE VIBE.

Strongly recommended for every Indian. Depicts where our country was 10 years ago and where it is now."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Exceptional Do Not Miss for Crime/Drama Fans,"I'm not revealing any spoilers because this series is simply too good of a story to ruin any element. Well-crafted, taut, and certainly fast-paced with new reveals in each episode, this series escapes the tired scripts and slow-moving death found all too often in this genre. English language viewers may want to turn on subtitles because of a rather thick native accent, and it is so good you don't want to miss anything as this series speeds like a downhill locomotive to its inexorable conclusion. The series weaves necessary commentary of Indian society, culture and family in the early 2000's without burdensome side stories interjected throughout, delivering a well-rounded story in seven episodes.

It is based on a true story and book about the main character as a young police inspector, so unless there are new chapters coming I don't think there will be a second season, but I would be very happy to be wrong."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Average!!!,"As it was from the Neeraj Pandey's Production house, Expectations was too much, but I don't know why they did not research on it as it was based in Bihar, clumsy storytelling, first two episodes were on high but them it was like...Dhadam!!! Seriously I mean the the accent the body language, it did not connected to the roots. They just mix up everything, I mean it was 2005 Ranjan singh was Transferred from Lohardaga (Jharkhand) to Shiekhpura (Bihar).

In Bihar we did not call lugai, we call mehraru.

No doubt , the two Leads were Bang on, specially Mr. Chandan Mahato. But Some very exceptional artist were useless."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,A Proper Executed and Fine Work by Sir Neeraj Pandey. - itsbymayank,"I will not mention names of any character, all were great in there roles not a single person disappointed by his or her acting.

They all just great in there characters.

I am writing this review late because I completed it in almost 4 days. I do binge watch but I gave this series time and enjoyed every scene, character and dialogue.

To be honest I appreciate work, the presentation, not just to write a review I watch a series in single shot.

I heard about the story from one of my friend and it's real so I thought of enjoying every part of the series.

I am fan of Neeraj Pandey Sir Work.

Maybe there's a flaw but while watching, it engage you in that manner that you'll ignore minors flaws.

Worth watch.

And that words of title song - Aaiye na hamra bihar me.. Still in mind and I am enjoying.. Loved the work.

Review of Khakee - itsbymayank Mayank Bharat Bhushan Louteriya (Khakee Review By itsbymayank)"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Slow moving but decent,"This crime series is rather slow moving but not without entertainment. The writing is rather cliched and typical of Bollywood cop flicks. Odd injections of humour juxtaposed with serious police gangster shoot outs. You just never know what will be around the corner. And I get the sense neither do the police in the series.

That's not to say that the story of a rising brutal criminal isn't fascinating to watch unfold. And the subsequent police cat-and-mouse game that they end up playing. I'm not sure how much of this show is fact-based, but the fact that there's some real-life basis to it, makes it a bit more intriguing. Worth sticking with it."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,OVERHYPED SERIES,"Acting - 6/10 main villan character selection is not that great choice ,

Directions - 6/10 too much unnecessary scenes to increase the length

ACTION -4/10 not much to say disappointed to see no action scenes in Bihar

Songs 1/10 web series me song kon daalta hai??

Overall - 6/10 stories of Bihar but neeraj sir fail to show actual Bihar feel like series shooting occured in Mumbai or in rich state . Only last 2 episode are worth watching rest of them is not that good . Fail to give details of corruption just shows there is corrupt people. Watch only if you have enough time otherwise just same."
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Superb! What a series,"Avinash Tiwary Nailed it what a transformation! His eyes,his lips look perfect for bihari character his style of eating khaini/gutka! Wow also abhimanyu Singh and Ashutosh Rana both are great! Karan tacker is ming blowing... "" Chvyanprash character was also good and I love the character of his wife she is cute sometimes best scene for me in last episode... Episodes are long maximum one hour look like stretching some scenes but at the end of the episode it's fine my english is not perfect I am trying to express my feelings after just watching the series! Great job neeraj Pandey sir and I love the song ""Aaiye na hamre bihar me"" in every episode this song meanings change sometimes they 'inviting' and sometimes the meaning is 'don't come'"
Khakee: The Bihar Chapter,Not just another gangster saga!,"This 7 episode series based on Bihar Diaries by IPS Amit Lodha is power packed with the much required fast pace and solid performances! Having read the book few years ago I can surely say Neeraj Pandey does great justice to the story line. Karan Tacker is perfectly cast as lead character Amit Lodha so is Avinash Tiwary as the antagonist. Abhimanyu Singh, Ravi Kishan, Ashutosh Rana each seems to fit in amazingly well to their characters. The dramatisation of plot is done well enough to ensure while depicting both sides of the story and the cinematography bring back the nostalgia of early 2000s. This one is a sure shot binge watch."
Samantha!,,
Numberblocks,No idea what the previous review below is on about!,"So I have a 5 year and a 2 year old. My eldest has watched this since he was 3 and he's now literally a maths whizz! He just gets numbers in a way me or my wife never did. He knows his square numbers up 20... and pictures them as squares... obvious maybe to us now as adults but I don't ever remember being taught in that way. He understands odds and even numbers, odds having an 'odd top' when arranged in a column of 2 wide. He gets prime numbers, and is able to tell me the prime numbers up to 109. He impressed the head of the school when they were singing ""The 12 days of Christmas"" she had asked what all the gifts added together would make (I'm pretty sure she wasn't serious) but my son imagined a large step shape and answered ""78!"". She was blown away!

So in no way is this show ""dumbing down"" kids tv content. That's a totally ridiculous comment. It's made my kids smarter than they would be without it- it's better then watching about dinosaurs or lego!

Oh and because of this show my 2 year old knows his 2,3,4,5 and 10 times tables. It's actually insane. Love this show."
Numberblocks,Great for my kid,"My kid loves this show, he's learned so much and Can count to over a 100 at 4"
Numberblocks,Brilliant methodology to learn math,Thoughtfully created individuals that are perfect for teaching concepts in a concise manner. Engaging episodes that other learning programs should emulate.
Numberblocks,Amazing math skills for kids!,"My five year old not only LOVES this show but has learned so much from it. Not only does it teach counting but addition, subtraction, skip counting, square roots and so much more but in a way that kids understand and learn from! And the short episode are perfect and don't make it overwhelming. One of the best learning shows for kids ever!"
Numberblocks,Sneaky Math,This show is fun for kids to watch and its all math. Brilliant!
Numberblocks,A pretty solid show,"Numberblocks is a pretty solid show in my opinion. The animation is amazing and the songs are pretty catchy. Not to mention that some episodes even teach things that aren't even apart of preschool mathematics such as Multiplication and Division (take that, Team Umizoomi)! Aside from the wildly toxic fanbase that even makes Vyond look sane in comparison, my only problem is that One can become a pretty arrogant blockhead at times. But overall, I recommend the show and if you hate it, I'm okay with it."
Numberblocks,Brilliant Show,Both of my kids are really into this cartoon. They watch over and over. It really solidifies Math for them both. My son hasn't even started kindergarten yet. He's was already naturally inclined for mathematics but now he is completely ahead of the game. My daughter loves the show as well. She will go to 3rd grade knowing much more this year thanks to your show.
Numberblocks,Math for Children at it's finest,"I can't say enough good things about this show. Whether it's the visual representation of numbers and the ability to relay the point across to the audience or it catchy songs; Numberblocks is like a math class your kids will want to attend. It's characters are well written with personalities of their own and they show pride in their numerological abilities, for example there is a square club which contains 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 etc.

The show also strongly grasps all 4 of the basic mathematical functions: +-×÷. It explains these in a way that's fun for children and as long as they have at least some interest in math, they should be able to grasp the concepts and do basic math."
Numberblocks,turned my nephew into genious!!!!,"My nephew used to use my Netflix for fun..one time his mother asked him few questions of maths for fun and to all ou suprise he was just too much for us to handle

He could multiply 25*25 divide numbers knew all tables could do most of the stuff we could just imagine him do.

He is just 6-7 year old...after lot of inquiry about who taught him this he said number blocks...took use really some time to understand he watched it on Netflix.

Great stuff...I think his ability to enjoy the show made him understand the simplicity of maths involved.

We are trying to get him lear more, but we find his ability without this show... really great full."
Numberblocks,Excellent!,"My about to turn 5 yr old is adding, subtracting and even doing simple multiplication. She loves numbers and really learned a lot from this show."
Numberblocks,The most amazing show for Math,"I wish they taught math like this wonderfully when I was a kid myself. It is immensely engaging. Kudos to the whole team for this masterpiece. Hands down the best early math education series I have ever seen. Through catchy songs, vibrant animations, and engaging storytelling, it keeps children entertained while they learn. It uses colorful blocks with numbers to represent mathematical concepts, making it tangible and easier for young minds to grasp fundamental math ideas. It lays a strong foundation for mathematical understanding in early education, fostering a positive attitude towards numbers and math."
Numberblocks,The verdict is in... Parents aren't doing the best things for their children,"This is a baby show about counting to 3.

Educational. I guess.

Fun. Maybe.

Entertaining. No way.

Kinda dumbed down. Yes.

The show is boring. Being colorful and 3d doesn't cut it.

Its 2020 and we have a boring educational show. Back in my day we had cool mature fun children show about day to day life that didn't involve hand holding.

Now in 2020 where we are supposed to be advanced we've gone backwards to count to 3.

Parents if they weren't lazy and stupid busy they should be the ones teaching their children how to count. Not TV. TV is there to entertain. Who watches TV to learn to add 1 + 1? That makes no sense.

TV has tons of hand holding and toxic shows that parents don't mind their children watching. Number blocks is really boring.."
Numberblocks,Absolutely brilliant!!!,"My 6 year old and 4 year old absolutely love this show! It has helped both children with having a above and beyond math comprehension over their peers. Their teachers want to know the secret. This one I can't credit for, tell them all its Numberblocks!! Thank you all! The show is even entertaining to me!! Thanks again for creating this fabulous show!"
Numberblocks,"So, so clever.","My three year old is obsessed with counting, addition, and is beginning to learn simple multiplication. I can take absolutely no credit. This show breaks things down in a way which children understand and retain without even realising, because they love the characters, the storylines and the songs. And to be honest, so do I. ""High Five"" is definitely in my top ten tunes, somewhere after Jimmy Jazz and before Heart-shaped Box.

I hope the writers can find a way to make more advanced mathematics enjoyable and easy, otherwise I shall be cursing their names when my son wants to start algebra next year."
Numberblocks,"Along with BFDI, it is one of my favorite shows!","This show inspired people not only to learn math and be smart, but to make their own NB OCs, fan shows, gijinkas, etc. I even did that too.

It even spawned a community but it is so damn toxic, probably because of how many extremely toxic kids there are, they are so toxic, so mean and SO, BURGER FLIPPIN', ANNOYING. Good thing I was never in the community because I don't know how to get in it. Lucky me! (7's catchphrase)."
Numberblocks,AMAZING,Extremely fun way to learn math. My daughter 5 years old learned great deal and loves to watch it
Numberblocks,I don't ever write reviews- but I LOVE this show,"It's a counting show, but it makes counting fun. It's kind of like School House Rock, but just with math.

My boys love watching it and my 3year old can now count to 12! Before he would count from 1-5 but skip #4. He also knows that 3+3 make 6 and other random ways of adding numbers together. The songs are catchy and the characters are so fun! I love this show so much. My sister-in-law also loves this show and it helped her son count by 10's to 100 and he can also count by 5's

Can't recommend enough!"
Numberblocks,Brilliant,My four year old loves this show and in the process is getting familiar with numbers. He's watched all episodes multiple times and accurately recites equations. Pretty genius show!
Numberblocks,Really Crazy Show!!!,Comentario no disponible
Numberblocks,"Got my kid into maths, but became scary","My three year old daughter got so into this show, she started doing and understanding multiplication and division. Unfortunatly when 100 came along she became so terrified she leaves the room and refuses to watch numberblocks anymore. Maybe because 100 has one eye and a deep voice? I hope the furture episodes are less scary for the little ones who are old enough to understand some of it. Brilliant show otherwise."
Numberblocks,A bit scary for my son,Comentario no disponible
Numberblocks,show sticks,"Its literally a ripoff of numberjacks And kids are uploaded numberblocks on tiktok I think numberjacks is an og But numberblocks??? I liked blues clues,mickey mouse clubhouse more than numberblocks Bad show through."
Numberblocks,"Whoever Thinks This Show Is Scary, You Are Wrong","I Love This Show, I Could Watch It All The Day, I Hope There Is SEASON 6, I Love The Animation, And Also I Love The Character's Voice, And Btw I Hope BBC Launches 6th Season!"
Numberblocks,"(Read Desc) Great Show, Horrifying Community!","(Update 2022: This review is heavily opinionated and most likely outdated. I made this... thing when I was 15 and still figuring things out about social media and life in general. (I'd delete it but I don't know how to delete IDMB review's oof-) I had the mindset of ""show good, fandom bad"" back then, since I experienced it first hand. I have since left the community and have grown to see that the things I was complaining about (while still a bit morally questionable) were far from as bad as things could get online. (Boy was I naïve back then) There was a lot of toxicity in this community. Which comes naturally for a fandom based on kids show (Hello My Little Pony) and while that obviously does not excuse any of these people's behavior, I have since seen just how bad things could get. And no longer stand by this review. (Another reason being that it's fandom has nothing to do with the show itself why'd I even bring it up?) Feel free to report this if you wish (not like I use the website anyway...) However, until that happens, enjoy this trainwreck of a review!)

I Love This Show! It Teaches kids About Suprisingly Advanced Math Skills In A Way That Is Not Confusing. Most Kids Shows That Try to Teach Subjects Like Multiplication Just Tell You What The Awnsers Are And That's It. But Numberblocks Teaches These Kinds Of Subjects In A Fun Interesting Way! The Show Is Also Adorable! Two's Song Touches Me Every Time!

The Only Reason I'm Giving It A Nine A Not A Ten Is Becuase Of It's Community. The Numberblocks Community Is Not A Child Freindly Environment! It Includes Extremely Toxic People, Surprisingly Graphic Imagery For A Community Based On A Kids Show, And All Sorts Of Other Things Kids Should Not Be Seeing!

In Conclusion, If You Have A Little One, I Reccomened Putting Them On Numberblocks! But, And I'm Saying This As Someone In The NBC (NumberBlocks Community) Make Sure They Stay Away From It's Teenage Fanbase At All Costs!"

The InBESTigators,Surprisingly good,"Had to babysit with my friends kiddo for a while and during bed-time this show came to rescue. Kid really dig it (only problem that he didn't want to sleep, but star detective agency instead! XD) and it was pleasing to watch even for an adult. So much nice to watch, that I've finished whole season by myself in few following days, when I was going to bed myself."
The InBESTigators,Very good tv series,"This tv show is great if you want a kid-friendly ""law and order"" show. The cases are relevant to a normal kid's life (exaggerated slightly for TV's sake, of course) and have a solution that makes sense, unlike other law and order where the motive is some over exaggerated reason. I do think a few of the cases lack a tiny bit of creativity, and sometimes the humour can be a little dry."
The InBESTigators,The kind of show for kids I'm looking for,I love how the stories are narated. The characters are funny and cute. I can easily enjoy the show with my 5 and 9 years old kids. Wish they make more episodes.
The InBESTigators,Laugh tracks are cut off!!,This show is definitely worth the binge and a must watch!! It's better than all of the modern Disney sitcoms because it lacks the things that annoy most viewers: artificial laugh tracks!! The characters are so lovable and funny. Real jokes and investigative mysteries for the characters to solve are a clever replacement for the canned laugh tracks that ruin a good sitcom in today's society!!
The InBESTigators,Good clean fun for kids!,"Great series for kids, no profanity, no unnecessary innuendo or language like way too many kids shows, my 7 year old daughter loves it, we really hope they make more episodes!!!"
The InBESTigators,Super clever & funny,My kind of show! Teaches my kids critical thinking skills. We pause the show before the end and ask them kids to solve each mystery. I love the quirky humor. And the show has heart.
The InBESTigators,Great Show for the Kids and Parents,My 7 and 8 year old love this show! And it's good enough that I enjoy watching as well. The same people who did Little Lunch (another one of our favorite shows) created this. Family friendly and funny.
The InBESTigators,Good attempt,"Cases are fun and interesting, a bit dry for kids perspective. It would have been better if the story wasn't focused all on just Maudie while the the other kids have no contribution to investigation. If every character had their own strengths in their particular fields the show would not be so predictable. Maudie becomes annoying as a little Miss know it all."
The InBESTigators,My kids love this show.,"My kids, ages 8,8, and 12, love this show. It's fun and funny. They've gotten the neighborhood kids hooked on it too. There's nothing to worry about, nothing too grown up or questionable, nothing scary either. It's just a cute show."
The InBESTigators,Decent watch for a sunny afternoon,Comentario no disponible
The InBESTigators,LOVE this show,"My daughter is a 3rd grader and can't get enough of it. Good thing, because it is very clever, well done and even gives us adults a giggle. All the kids are great, esp Kyle, who steals the show. Terrific all around."
The InBESTigators,"Awesome show, great for the whole family","Great show! I love to watch it with my kids and actually have a good time! I love the way the format of the show, the comedy, the kids... I actually find myself trying to figure out the 'culprit'.

And to answer another reviews that said that the fake British accents sucked, um.... the show and the actors are from Australia, so yeah, totally different accent not trying to sound British..."
The InBESTigators,"Great, clean show for my 7 year old son","Growing up and living in Australia until I was 24 years old made me really appreciate this show. I married my American husband in 2004 and we now live in the US. We have a sweet 7 year old son. In flicking through different Netflix shows to watch, he found this series. I was happy to see that it was an Australian series and told him that's what primary school was like for mummy! I love the good acting, the good morals and the clean humor in this show! It truly is fun to watch along with my son! He loves it and can't wait till the next episode. I'm sad that only one season was made. I hope that the producers make more!"
The InBESTigators,My son loves this show,"He loves trying to figure out the mysteries before the kids. But Maudie is extremely clever! So, he admits it can be tricky. Great show for kids."
The InBESTigators,my daughter loves it,My daughter loves this show and wants a new series. She watches it on netflix.
The InBESTigators,My daughter loves this programme but it hurts my head.,"My daughter loves this programme its got some fab story lines and it's great for them no bad language and feel good stories about team work.

Only thing it is gives me a huge headache the background noises drive me mad so I have to let her watch it very quietly."
The InBESTigators,A big cause of having netflix,My 5 years old daughter loves it. We find the episodes funny and didactic. Thanks to all who have contrubited the series.
The InBESTigators,Great show for kids,"This is what kids tv should look like, no sexual innuendos, no bad language! Nothing that kids don't need to know at this young age, maybe Disney and Hollywood could learn a lot from this cute Australian show!!! Highly recommend to kids of all ages, my daughter has watched every episode multiple times!"
The InBESTigators,Great show,Its a good fun little show and its always a different twist at the end and its fun to figure out the cases with the kids. Its a great show for kids 5-10.
The InBESTigators,Awesome Family Show,"Great show for kids and entertaining for parents. We love the characters and the overall story of the show. Each episode is clever, funny, and a joy to watch"
The InBESTigators,Great fun,"I watch this with my kids. They love how all of the friends bring different views and personalities to the characters. They especially love the comedy of Kyle. I like how they are allowed to have flaws but apologize and forgive each person. The adults aren't idiots in it as well, just a bit goofy."
The InBESTigators,Hilarious and teaches my kids great lessons!,"The storyline of every episode is great, there are funny bits sprinkled throughout, and it consistently shows kids being creative, ambitious, good friends, team players, and helping with chores around the house.

Every character has strengths balanced by flaws and illustrates how differences should be celebrated. I don't get the reviews claiming racism at all. Yes, Ezra isn't a star student but he rattles off statistics about sports like a math wiz and is incredibly thoughtful and nice.

Refreshing for my 2nd grader to be hooked on something not related to or promoting video games or technology but promoting social interaction and well-rounded interests...without being boring.

We need a 3rd season, please! Maybe Poppy is old enough to take over for her brother :)"
The InBESTigators,A must watch series,"This series was super good , I enjoyed this series with my sister 💖"
The InBESTigators,Super awesome series,Fantastic series in the world I have ever seen 3rd season please.
The InBESTigators,"Irresistible for my 8 year old, but promotes *stereotypes* of black people","This show is soooo good that it is hard to pull myself away, but I feel that I really have to. Maudie, Ezra, and Eva are so clever. Kyle, however, has no brains or memory, but he is good at sports and loves to eat. Since the other three characters are so smart, in one way or another, Kyle's constant cluelessness and lack of contributions to the investigations really stands out. I really want to try to wean my child off of this show."

Still Game,Hilarious Show!,"We just ""discovered"" this show on NetFlix two weeks ago and we are addicted to it! We have watched all the episodes on NetFlix and are watching them all again already. (Thank goodness for the subtitles because some of the slang we can't understand, haha.) Great actors, clever scripts, so funny! We just LOVE Victor, Jack and Winston!! This show is unique because it's funny and has genuine ""heart"". The cast is top notch and we truly care about them so when Jack is missing his wife or Jack and Victor go to visit Winston in his awful new apartment out of town, the viewers really care about these characters in their sad situations (this proves what great actors they are). There are too many great episodes to pick a favorite! So many lines from this hilarious TV series have crept into our every day language, like ""cheery-bye"" (haha). We love how they make reference to many famous American entertainers that we love (like Perry Como, Jack Lord, ""Quincy,"" Abbott & Costello, etc.) We are so excited to hear that they are filming a new season this summer although we don't know how long it will be until American viewers can see them. Unfortunately, we can't find the series on Region 1 or 0 even though we would love to own them on DVD. We love, love, love ""Still Game""! Thanks, NetFlix, for bringing this amazingly clever, creative, fun, unique show to American viewers! (This show is funnier than any new American TV shows/movies!)"
Still Game,"Brilliant, simply...hold on...catch me breath, BRILLIANT!","I found this on Netflix. I've always loved the humor of Ireland and Scotland and figured, eh, I'll watch an episode or two. 13 were available (seasons 4 and 5) and I watched every one and laughed like hell. OK, I admit there were times I wasn't sure just what was being said, but even when I missed a joke (accent or local reference) I still laughed. It's that good.

If you want to have a summary of what this show is about, there are loads of places for that, but this is a review, not a summary so, no summary.

The lead actors are just amazing and can do deadpan so well, it seems like they're really just engaging each other, we're looking in on real people in their normal every day lives and, like every day life can be, we laugh.

There are occasionally poignant moments, but they seem almost like a tease, the humor is right there to push you back and say, ""Oh come now, this IS a comedy after all."" One side note, in the episode where the boys take the tour of the distillery, I could identify. My son and I took a tour of a brewery and were actually more interested in getting to the tasting room than how it's made. These guys took the idea of 'revisiting' to a whole new, hysterically funny level.

Worth every second, even if some of the dialogue slips by, sometimes if you just take what was said, figure in the goings on, you still get the joke, and it's still funny.

C'mon Netflix, bring on all those earlier seasons and let me enjoy every moment.

I had to amend my review and THANK Netflix for putting the first three season into the mix. I'm dancing through the heather with joy. Plus I have to add something that I neglected to put in the first time around, the supporting cast is as wonderful as the leads (though they have the edge of being the stars) and each one's little quirk and eccentricity makes them all the more fun to watch. Enjoy, ya bastards! hee hee hee."
Still Game,One Foot out of the Grave,"Back in the days NBC's ""Golden Girls"" pioneered in discovering a fresh comedic potential according to the premise: Pensioners are also entitled to some post-prime fun before a career-move that involves pushing up the daisies. Especially when they're operating from Miami, Florida, of course. Now picture this as good old Sophia would say: How about we give the whole retiree idea more edge, relocate the girls to Scotland (complete with heavy accent), change their gender and language to something way stronger and offensive (yet in its own way endearing), and replace the picturesque Miami-scenario with fictional ""shitehole"" Craiglang ""somewhere near Glasgow"" with prospects being hee-haw as a Scot would say. You'll see: The fun refuses to concede defeat. Quite to the contrary. Welcome to ""Still Game""!

Spun off from Ford Kiernan's and Greg Hemphil's sketch show ""Chewin' the Fat"", ""Still Game"" features strong 70+ characters ranging from the comedic widower duo Jack and Victor (Kiernan/Hemphil) over curmudgeon Winston, blabbermouth Isa and tight-arsed Tam to Indian-born shop owner Navid, who sports a rare talent for one-liners of the side-splitting kind. Now pleasures may be limited for old duffers, but life goes on and as such revolves around the local waterhole ""The Clansman"", the bookies, and the grocer's, with Isa's rumor mill working incessantly. Romance is a mere footnote. In that sense ""Still Game"" is not that far off the mark as real old geezers go. But in Craiglang there's a bright side to the shadow of old age: Death for example is a constant companion, accepted and dealt with in creative fashion (two words: hypothermia sweepstakes), and in the meantime as far as shaping the rest of one's life is concerned: disaster, small or large, is always around the corner. ""Still Game"", while out-and-out hilarious, occasionally dark-humored and sometimes over-the-top in a memorable way, also has its powerful dramatic moments. Character developments feel palpable and add another layer to the show and depth one wouldn't want to miss. The nine year long pause between season 6 and 7 is hardly noticeable. Following popular demand, ""Still Game"" is back again, as stand-up comedy and sitcom. So brush up on your Scottish, or turn on the subtitles. You don't want to miss this."
Still Game,As funny south of the border as it is north!,"I have noticed that a few other reviews have been commenting on how people south of the border (the English) will not relate too or understand this Scottish comedy? However I am an Englishman living on the south coast of England (which is probably as far south as you can get from Scotland on mainland Britain) and I am an absolute Still Game fanatic!

I have been brought up on virtually all of the British gems of the comedy world i.e Only Fools & Horses, Men behaving badly, Open all Hours, Porridge e.t.c so I was therefore a little surprised and sceptical when my best mate recommended a Scottish comedy called Still Game which hardly anyone in England had heard of, including me. One episode later and I was hooked!

For me Still Game in terms of humour was not worlds apart from virtually all the other British Comedies whether they originated from the South or North of the border, I could personally see elements of humour & comedy that could appeal to fans of 'Only Fools & Horses' right the way through to fans of 'Men behaving badly' and all the other comedies in between.

Next to the humour, the acting is superb with clever story lines and quotes that define it as a true gem. I only wish I could have followed this sitcom from the very beginning but unfortunately for some reason or another Still Game was never aired on English primetime TV (which seemed a bit stupid seeing as how England accounts for most of the BBC's viewers)."
Still Game,one of the best things on TV!,"Still Game is fantastic - taking on board some of the other peoples comments - the humour has been crude at times, and you could see some things coming - but the best thing about it is that a joke comes completely out of the blue (eg. Series 3 Ep1 with the tacky souvenirs and the ""Canadian Beaver"" t-shirt).

Either way, it's worth a shot. Like many TV programs, it may take a few episodes to get into. In Scotland this series has been highly popular in the ratings, but not shown Nationwide in the UK.

There is some talk about toning down the language - It is a disgrace trying to change it, as this is a representation of part of Scottish culture. If we apply the BBC's attitude to Still Game to other comedies then Only Fools and Horses would have contained no Cockney Rhyming Slang (and no where near as funny as it actually is)

One interesting thing noted is that as a series it appears to be taking a leaf from ""The Simpsons"" and branching out with many supporting characters who appear from time to time. I think this is keeping the series fresh.

For those brave enough to visit where the series is filmed - you'll no be able to get a pint down the Clansman - as the pub you see from the outside was knocked down sometime between April and May 04.

Like most of the other comments about this show - I would recommend this to anyone."
Still Game,Watch it every night before bed,Watched it thousands of times. Watch it every night before bed and still laugh every time. Excellent comedy.
Still Game,Hilarious,"I think it is important to begin by stating that I was dubious about any show made since the influence of American television on the British Isles. But this is Scottish! Perhaps the independence of Scottish spirit buttresses their humour against the negative influence of U.S. productions. The writing is brilliant in the sense that, unlike American TV, little, if any, is predictable. The timing is spot on and the laugh tracks are in sync with the punchlines instead of used as a constant background. Witty is the best one word description I could use to entice others to give the show a chance. The visual expressions combine with subtlety to present the kind of humour I thought was lost on television. Sit back, put your feet up and enjoy television, once again."
Still Game,I love love this,"Ok first the accent is thick but it's perfect. The funny thing is the caption are not corrected English but how it's said. So you get cannea, Boabby, Disney, our etc. That's just the icing on this Scottish cake. The situations are so damn funny. The characters are so real but the humor is genius, cheeky , kinda adult but still familyish. All I will say is make it your go to show. Tytyty Netflix."
Still Game,I've never heard my husband laugh like he does while watching this show.,A great antidote to a pandemic. For us Americans: closed captions required.
Still Game,I rewatch this show every year,"Great chemistry between characters and it reminds me of a better time! I wish my grandfather was alive to watch this with me.

I feel like it will be timeless and approachable by all. Incredible writing. It gets a little wackier towards the ends but still highly entertaining. I do love the earlier seasons. I am not scottish and love the accents and the concept. Showing our elderly as playful and young minded. On of my all time favorite shows.

Usually a show only has one or two favorite characters. This show its hard to decide because tam and winston are hilarious and so are jack and victor. Bobby the bartender plays the fool brilliantly. A ttue gem."
Still Game,Game On!,"Still Game is an absolute little gem of a comedy taking Victor and Jack from their sketch's in 'Chewin the Fat'into the wider world of fictional Glasgow scheme estate Craigland.

Victor and Jack are two elderly widowed gentlemen living in a grim world of scraping by on their pensions trying to keep warm in their high storey flats. But they make sure they make the most of their situation and it's pretty inspirational stuff.

The best laughs come from the other characters, crafty Winston, gossip Isa, shopkeep Naveed, barman Boaby etc, plenty of good story lines and sharp put downs make for the type of show where if you buy the DVD you watch one episode and keep on until the end, then go out and buy the another series Sadly on the network the BBC has seen fit to screen only a select few episodes. Okay the accents and certain jokes/references require a knowledge of Scottish culture/dialect but like Rab C Nesbitt the comedy is strong enough to shine through.

The laughs are often dark, and set amongst the bleak black drops of old age, poverty, crime, loneliness you name it! But like say 'One foot in the Grave' it is adept at handling serious situations then bringing us back to the comedy with just one hot line. For a spot of spirit in adversity look no further."
Still Game,Superb series - keep them coming.,"Having 'found' Still Game on BBC2 a couple of years ago it has consistently delivered great comedy. I was fortunate enough to be given the Series 1-5 on DVD at Christmas which has brought the opportunity to view the 'Scotland only' episodes. So many things explained..so many laughs I would not have had!

As for criticism of the accents / language etc. - it's nae for wee bairns noo.. Put the subtitles on or roll back the DVD scene. Easy.

Like all good comedy programmes, Still Game has the power to engage its audience in taking them on an emotional journey ranging from sadness to hilarity - as evidenced in Jack and Victor's trip to Canada followed by the gift review at The Clansman.

Good writing that has improved as the characters develop (check out the early episodes of 'The Fast Show' and see how their characters do the same). Most episodes have the ability to make me laugh out loud.

Sadly, I'm now at the end of Series 6 so have to wait and see whether there will be Series 7.. Just don't kill Jack or Victor yet please.

They may be old but they're definitely Still Game!"
Still Game,"Starts off on a high, great till season 6 then mainly downhill","I am perhaps lucky that I grew up, and live near to where the show is based, Glasgow. So I have no issues with the accent and pretty much that is the way many around this area speak. My only gripe is the overuse of swear words, to try and get a cheap laugh. Not necessary guys the show is funny enough without that. After a slowish start, as with most sitcoms, as we get to know the characters, the show is on a steep incline in terms of laughs and quality. First 6 seasons are very good and as good a comedy as you get anywhere. The 2 main actors had a bit of falling out, I believe, which is why there is a big gap between season 6 and 7. They patched up their differences, had huge sell out tours in 2014 and brought back the show in 2016. There are some decent episodes in season 7, 8 and 9 but generally the quality took a nose dive, like many sitcoms that outstayed their welcome Last episode is very poignant, which leaves the viewers to decide for themselves the ending, Some memorable characters, Naveed, and his wife, Isa, Tam and Winston"
Still Game,Light entertainment but not hilariously funny,"It was like Last of the Summer Wine, how people find it that funny is surprising, especially a British sitcom. Would class it as lighthearted entertainment."
Still Game,Pure class!!,"The fourth series of Still Game recently finished on BBC2. This was the first time it had been shown nationwide and, thankfully, the unthinkable didn't happen. The slang. the swearing, the banter and the accents were all present and correct. You've got to hand it to the BBC for choosing not to tone down the dialect, if they'd been allowed to anglicise Still Game it just wouldn't be the same. I recently met the show's creators Ford Kiernon and Greg Hemphill at a book-signing and when they were quizzed over the possibility of Still Game being toned down, Kiernon replied, ""Naw, they can get it up them!"". Rapturous applause followed.

You wouldn't think this programme was now in its fourth series, it still feels as sharp and fresh as it did back in 2002. While most programmes, like Ford and Greg's own Chewin' The Fat for example, tend to go downhill after a couple of runs, Still Game seems to improve with each series. Admittedly most of the laughs consist of old people swearing at each other but the excellent cast deliver their put-downs with gusto. The two leads, Kiernon in particular, make very convincing pensioners; little touches like shuffling slightly and muttering under their breath work well.

The supporting cast are excellent as well. Jane McCarry, who plays ""nosey old cow"" Isa, sounds frighteningly like an old woman and her double act with Paul Riley's Winston is uproarious. Gavin Mitchell as Bobby the barman and Mark Cox as tight-fisted Tam are also excellent. But the absolute standout is Sanjeev Kohli as the acid-tongued shopkeeper Navid, Still Game's ultimate scene-stealer. Scottish dialect delivered in an Indian accent is funny in a way you've never heard and his horrific remarks to his wife Mena (whose face is always hidden) are comedy gold.

Along with being consistently hilarious, Still Game is occasionally very touching; Jack memories of his late wife and Victor's strained relationship with his son are bring a real pathos and humanity to the proceedings. These moments are quiet and understated, giving Still Game a maturity that Chewin' The Fat lacked.

Whether or not the folks down south got it or not is still unclear, some dreadful reviews would suggest not, but who gives a toss as Scotland once again has a sitcom it can really be proud of. Easily a match for Rab C Nesbitt, Still Game is a hilarious, bittersweet and thoughtful look at life through the eyes of the elderly - and a real celebration of Scottish, particularly Glasgow, culture. Long live Still Game!"
Still Game,This show makes me happy :),"Since discovering this series not all that long ago, I think I watched it three times! Each time it gets better <3 Great stories - some hilarious, some poignant - endearing characters. What more can an audience ask for? I don't watch comedies often because they're quite honestly don't as a rule make me laugh, but I get a lots of laughs out of this one! I just love the show and send out a thanks to the creators !"
Still Game,Miss them already ..... this Must-See series,"Started watching the show my expectations were not too high but boy was I wrong.

I've only just finished the final season and I miss Jack & Victor already along with the other characters of Craiglang.

What a great show, hilariously funny ...."
Still Game,Marvelous...and Netflix FINALLY has it captioned!,"The following is NOT meant as an insult to anyone: Most Americans seem to have difficulty understanding strong Scottish accents. And, I assume, most Scots have a hard time understanding us. That being said, despite the difficulties, I enjoyed watching re-runs of ""Still Game"" on Netflix even though it was occasionally difficult following what they were saying. Fortunately, Netflix IS captioning the program now and it really helps with my enjoyment of this cute series.

The show centers on two Scotsmen who are roommates. Neither wants to grow old gracefully and both have a variety of strange friends who they associate with...including some they don't even like! In many ways, the show SEEMS slow and mundane but keep watching. Like the wonderful Canadian show, ""Corner Gas"", the seemingly mundane becomes very enjoyable and you really grow to love the characters and weird situations they've gotten themselves into. Overall, ""Still Game"" is a marvelous show...full of wit and cleverness."
Still Game,It's simply perfect. A hidden gem.,"Netflix analytics was certain I'd like Still Game. I resisted for a while but eventually succumbed and I'm very pleased I did.

I've now watched all 9 seasons twice. The second viewing was made even more enjoyable with the knowledge that Boaby (which, on the face of it, is a Glaswegian pronunciation of Bobby) has a slang meaning ;-)

I recommend giving this series a chance. It just gets better and better. The cast are a delight.

Greg and Ford say that there will be no more episodes with the original cast. I've read talk of a prequel. To be honest, I will be watching whatever they produce next."
Still Game,This is me I'm still going,"Still Game is a television comedy that I stumbled, upon purely by accident while programme skimming on Netflix.

I quickly became hooked by the humorous banter of the characters, this was a new world to me especially as I have no knowledge of its antecedents.

It is very broad Scots and I can quite see, how many viewers can be put off by that, but then I am not a novice at Scottish humour.

My introduction to it was way back in the days of the TV show the White Heather Club, which used to be seen on our TV screens south of the border around Hogmanay.

For me this was very much a mixed blessing especially what passed for humour, the least said about that the better as personally it was dire.

It wasn't until the broadcast of the telly show Naked Video, that I really started to take any notice at all. That led to the frankly seminal Rab C. Nesbitt, we'd been prepared for it as Rab and Mary's characters had been trailed in Naked Video.

This show for me sets the scenario for Still Game, with similar neighbourhoods, bottom of the barrel characters, situations and lives.

When my son Jamie first saw Still Game he immediately pinpointed something that I had ignored, that these were merely youngish blokes, simply camouflaged as older codgers.

While I freely admit that is the case I prefer to, ignore that and concentrate on the comedy, character banter, and the hilarity of the yes, often absurd but still very funny, situations that the characters become immersed in.

There is often strong language used between them, but this is one of shared experience, and genuine attitudes and feelings, between people who have to, let's face it effectively sink or swim in the same surroundings.

I can appreciate Still Game more now because I am, of the similar age group as Jack and Victor at 74.

They are a great cross section of humanity having to, survive in this small community of Craigland, all of whom are deftly drawn by the brilliantly observed character acting."
Still Game,Best comedy on TV at the moment,"Still Game is undoubtedly the comedy highlight of the week.

I don't understand why I keep reading comments that you have to be Scottish to 'get' this with some people even claiming they're unable to understand the dialogue, which I think says rather more about them...

If you enjoy good acting, fantastic characters (every one of them capable of stealing a scene) and rollicking good story lines then you can't fail to enjoy Still Game whether you're Scottish, English, Welsh, Irish or Martian.

Hemphill and Kiernan have produced an understated and undervalued masterpiece. It's a disgrace that the first few series were not shown nationwide and with all the channels at their disposal is it too much to ask that the BBC repeat them in an attempt to get this series the credit it deserves?"
Still Game,Scottish comedy at its finest!,"There are some mixed opinions i see, and i guess thats what its all about. However firstly may i add that this series is massive North of the border and you do need a Scottish sense of humour to really enjoy this. I can't see the English enjoying this at all since either side of the border differ greatly on tastes.

The 1st series was outstanding, the 2nd not quite as good but still up providing plenty of laughs. The 3rd has just finished and i have to say it was fantastic!

You really won't get this if you need it translated south of the border and i hope they don't decide to screen it in England as BBC Scotland has been told they must tone down the Scottish slang if they do.

Its a fantastic outlook on how poor weegie OAP's go about their daily routine, still thinking they are in their 20's, quite simply a breath of fresh air from the traditional American and English comedies

Bring on series 4 lads!"
Still Game,Best one,Best thing which can happen to you.lots of love.Thank you.
Still Game,Stop now !,I'm really surprised that they still use writers on this programme! after season 6 this went dramatically down hill no laughs
Motu Patlu: Deep Sea Adventure,,
Light in the Dark,I liked it,"Overall it wasn't bad at all. The acting was good, specially the husband and the wife. I cried and i laughed and for me it's enough to give a positive review."
Light in the Dark,story was told in a casual way,"The story was mostly told in a casual way replicating many previous movies without adding something new

DELICIOUS

-We need to quickly admire Rita Dominic and Angel Unigwe😊 These two beauties were stunning and carried themselves with so much grace.

Angel made us smile with her smile and was effortlessly natural Rita understood her role and radiated the required melancholic atmosphere

-Muhammad Atta Ahmed, the cinematographer, should be given an A for effort for good lighting and angles captured

-Costume and make-up designs were well executed! The teams should be proud of the elegance they translated into each character, especially Jumoke

-""Parenthood is not in the conception but in the caring and nurturing of a child,"" a phrase that was reiterated in the movie.

The film sent a poignant message on the necessity to raise children for who they are

BLAND

---Acting was, regrettably, mediocre among all actors; they were solely reciting lines without being carried away by the mood of the film, and the cliché dialogues made it unattractive

-Camera was, in most scenes, fixed at one angle for an extended period without filming other vantage points; lighting wasn't always controlled during the daytime scenes

-Audio suffered...😓

-Light in the Dark was similar to films like 'Act of Faith' and 'Tango With Me'. Though it did have little twists, the idea remained the same and we could map out the end from the beginning.

---Many scenes were abruptly cut and some logic was missing."
Light in the Dark,Beautiful Story/Script,"I enjoy the the storyline The cast played their role well. Felt all the emotions and feels

Definitely worth the watch💯"
Light in the Dark,A beautiful film...,"A beautiful film, however heavy drama, a sample of which dramatic is the life of a rape victim, the woman tries to hide it, and few complain, here we see the reality, since the fact shames, humiliates, often the aggressor is not punished, even with rocas, see Mariana Ferrer, sad, revolting and disgusting... The outcome was excellent, with a resolution of the case and a final drama just as strong, with a beautiful, painful, sensitive and beautiful resolution.. ."
The Mafia Dolls,I know.,I know there was a decade between seasons but season 2 is hard to watch. Maybe because everyone has aged and i dont know who is who but ill see if it grows on me....
The Mafia Dolls,Las Munecas ... muy bueno para mi!,"There are actually TWO headings on IMDB for this same show, made in Colombia; the other is The Mafia Dolls. There were actually two series, yet The Mafia Dolls shows only one. So, pick your poison and subtitle away.

Standout is La Diva de Divas - Amparo Grisales (in both series) who altho' about twice the age of The 5 or so main Dolls, is probably the hottest and sexiest of them all. Check out her skimpy outfits in the intro's ... and on the Net.

Takes around 120 episodes to showcase the antics of various Cartel KingPins and how their women are easily thrown away, in the pursuit of money and power, just like a rag doll. The going is good when you are in favor, but when the tides turn, its on to the next.

Of course nothing lasts for ever and the KingPins are always trying to upstage (and kill) one another; not to mention staying one step ahead of The Law. If you are in to ""The Cartels"" TV genre, you will like this one also.

When done, check out ""Rosario Tijeras"" (the version starring Barbara de Regil.) Babs has the best Abs in the biz and kicks major butt in tight outfits..."

Top Gear,You don't even have to like cars....,"Yes, this show is about cars, but then again it isn't. Mostly it's about extremes of opinion, dreams and fantasies, dares, one-up-man-ship, and taking everything just a little bit further. And it's also entertaining - very entertaining, which is what television is meant to be, and so often is not. I'm not all that interested in cars, and my son doesn't even drive, but we both love the show, and watch it religiously.

The balance of presenters: Jeremy, the loud-mouthed, cuttingly funny, over-bearing older guy; Richard, the young, cute, quirky, adolescent one; James, the sensitive, quiet, contemplative, intelligent one; is nothing short of genius!

It seems that no expense is spared, either on the experiments and dares, or on filming, and this adds to the visual experience. This show is funny, even hilarious at times, classy, controversial, and hugely entertaining. Most people I know who watch this show know almost less than nothing about cars, and I think that says a lot about how successfully this program reaches beyond the expected demographic of young male petrol-heads."
Top Gear,This one goes up to 11!!,"I don't care what anyone says - the British are the funniest of all. Jeremy, Richard and James are all so different - but this is what makes this show REALLY work. I have fallen off the couch so many times laughing that it is becoming a hazard!

The show is entertaining, informative and hilarious - I would say the only drawback is after watching it you have to go and get in your own car and imagine what Jeremy would say about it. (I can assure you - his comments would not be good about mine!!)

It also doesn't hurt that James May is the most delicious thing on two legs - I just love this British gentleman - he is what men ought to be!

This one definitely goes all the way to 11!"
Top Gear,"Simply the Best Television Program and DVD Series Devoted to Automobiles, Ever","As an American, your selection of automotive programming is quite limited. On one hand there is the SPEED Channel that is not available in every market, and on the other there is the ""Powerblock"" on Spike TV that offers little more than how to add a bit of power to your Grandmother's '81 Caprice.

Even as an import, Top Gear simply blew my mind away during my first viewing of the show last year when The Discovery Channel ran a season of the show slightly altered for the US Market.

For one, the personality of the show is unlike anything I have seen before. The show's lead host, Mr. Jeremy Clarkson is rather opinionated on everything, and although he will never hide the fact that he does not like something, he himself is quite likable as a person. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there is Mr. James May, quite possibly the most British man I have ever seen on television or in the movies. He isn't offensive in any way, and although he may be known as ""captian slow,"" his presentations are quite enjoyable as they always seem to come from someone with a level head. Caught in the middle is Mr. Richard Hammond, a rather young Briton who embodies the current generation of automotive fandom. All together, the hosts balance each other out, and each offer their own perspective to the show, appealing to a wide range of people.

Outside of the ""acting,"" the cinematography of the show is breathtaking, given that it is a weekly event in the UK. Occasionally the segments rival that of some of the best television shows or movies that I have seen, and although they are primarily focused on the car and the hosts themselves, the surrounding environment often plays a large role in the different reviews.

...But then you add the great soundtracks of the reviews, the quirky setups to the different tests (such as a Bugatti Veyron racing a plane from Italy to England), and the great test laps done by the Stig... It all adds up to one of the greatest television programs, well, ever.

It truly is a shame that the viewing of Top Gear is generally limited to the internet via You Tube or Google Video here in the US, but there was a pilot filmed for The Discovery Channel in the US for an American version of Top Gear, but thus far, nothing has happened.

If you have the time, I highly suggest you take a look at the show, interested in automobiles or not."
Top Gear,Hands down the greatest show about cars in the world.,"Top Gear is, without question, the single greatest show about cars on TV. What sets Top Gear apart is the attitude the presenters have. Other shows tend focus on reviewing all of the various technical details and specifications of the particular car they review... They'll give you more information yes, but they do so in a cold and clinical manner. That comes off as being a bit, well, German doesn't it? Top Gear on the other hand, refuses to take itself seriously, which is what makes it so great. Sure, Top Gear will talk about how many newton meters of torque the Mercedes AMG CLS65 has and how that makes it the most powerful production car in the world, but how will they convey that? By showing you just how many men it requires to beat it in a tug of war contest. They'll try to explain why the Cadillac Escalade, arguably one of the worst cars you can buy, is one of the coolest. They'll see how many motorcycles you can jump with a bus. Yes, you read that the right way 'round: How many parked motorcycles you can jump over while driving a bus.

But Top Gear is more than just goofing around in cars. It's witty, it's funny, and it makes you feel like one of the guys. The three presenters all poke fun at one another, at cars, at themselves, and all the while you feel like you are right there in the studio hanging out with them. Oh yeah, and you don't even have to like cars to like the show. There's something in it for everyone. For sheer car freaks, the filmed review segments of the cars have seriously high production value- You'd think you were watching a $150 million dollar film directed by Michael Bay. The are just that slick. The music selection used in the filmed segments is also top notch, with some of the coolest cuts from both then and now. The news segment, where the presenters sit down to discuss what's new in the world of cars, traffic laws, or motoring in general is riotously funny. You may not know who the Chief Constable of Wales or the British Minister of Transporation are, but trust me- You don't need to in order to laugh at them. Then there's the ""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car"" segment, where each week a guest celebrity will come on to do an interview and then race around the Top Gear test track in a budget priced sedan to see how they compare to other famous celebrities who have done the same. And for the girls that tune in? Well, there's co-host Richard Hammond.

It is the presenters (hosts) that make the show though. You'll love to hate Jeremy Clarkson, possibly the worlds most opinionated and boastful man. James May, in sharp contrast, is almost a stereotype of an English gentleman. Reserved, witty, and refusing to run on television, May is cursed with quite possibly the best narrative style and voice I've ever heard. Bringing up the rear is Richard Hammond, the youngest, shortest, and most enthusiastic of the lot. Women will love him, because he's also the cutest.

I'm not even going to mention their tamed racing driver who tests all of the high powered cars on the same track to see how they compare to one another, a mysterious creature dressed in white that is only known as ""The Stig"". Well, apart from that mention of The Stig. I won't do it any more.

But please, please please, make sure you watch the full, unedited, hour-long version of Top Gear, which in some markets is known as ""Top Gear Xtra"". There is a trimmed down 30 minute version of the show which omits the news, the celebrities, and trims the filmed reviews for time. It's still good, but nowhere near as brilliant. And avoid the horribly edited and mangled US version of the show. Arguably the best Car show on in the states, it is an affront to the glory that is the raw, hour long series that is broadcast in the UK."
Top Gear,The best show on TV just keep getting better...,"I've been watching this show for over 7 years now and I have to say it just keeps getting better. Many people spit and shout about the show not being about cars and more of an entertainment show than a car show. Well firstly let me say that this show began in 1978and went on for 12 seasons and the one complaint about that show was that it was boring and Clarkson picked up on this and changed the show (in my view) for the better.

What is it about the show that makes it so outrageously good? Well lets discuss the characters. Jeremy Clarkson - the man you wish was your friend. A sarcastic, cheeky and rude individual who is hilariously funny. His ideas are genius and he is not afraid to speak his mind - that is what i like most about him. He does not and will not lie and say a car is good and/or bad on bias alone in which many people think he does. Take Alfa's for instance, he loves them, but he will not sugar coat what he knows about the electrics in the car you just have to actually listen to what he says. Richard Hammond - The quirky one. Tends to be more positive about things but my god he is funny. His outrageous ideas and creations like his Narrow boat are fantastic. He is critical when reviewing, yet entertaining when necessary. James May (Captain Slow) - You have to love him really. He is a more precise critic on cars but tend to take, Unfortunately for him, more boring cars like 4 door saloons but in recent episodes we have seen him show his true colours and passion for cars by taking the Veyron up to top speed twice.

You have to remember that this is no the reason why this show is still a highly rated show 8 years on is not just because of these 3 personalities. When Clarkson was asked why is this show so great he gave FULL responsibility to the camera crews (who do absolutely stunning wok and should set a benchmark for cameramen around the world), the producers (who supposedly stay in work until 2am working) and all the back-room staff that organise everything.

You have to remember that these people have a passion for cars. Anyone who loves cars and has that inner child inside which allows for that bit of fun would realise that this truly is one of the best shows on modern TV and always will be. It is also every 10 year old dream job and also mine!"
Top Gear,Worth every penny the BBC invests.,"While it can be argued that more substantial programmes exist, whether fictional or not, it is certain that Top Gear is an extraordinarily entertaining show with plenty to keep most on their bolsters. This is certainly due to the faithful backing of the BBC, but more importantly, to the three crazed bloody lunatics who host the series. Clarkson, May and Hammond share between each other many decades worth of experience in broadcasting, as well as motoring, and are impeccable contrasts well matched for their respective opinions 'n roles. The various features included in the shows and the involvement in these & all motoring matters, are exemplary, and quite frankly, unmatched by anything television has yet seen. I can safely assume that no better motoring show exists anywhere. I love it, so will you, guaranteed."
Top Gear,Hilarious show! Then the BBC fired Clarkson.,"This show was absolutely amazing when Clarkson, May and Hammond were hosting. It was great! I watched this with my dad and we both found it absolutely hilarious, I'm a big fan of Clarkson (not his politics) and he just brought the humour along with Hammond and May. When the BBC fired Clarkson they shouldn't have kept it going as it lost all that was good about it. Me and my dad watched an episode of Chris Evans hosting top gear - TRASH. Matt LeBlanc hosting - Not one laugh in the entire episode. Stick with Clarkson, May and Hammond."
Top Gear,Skip everything from 2016 forward,"Top Gear is classic.

Top Gear is best car / vehicle show ever made and it is a diamond.

Top Gear is funny, interesting and packs a punch of information about cars.

Well it was until 2016 came along and they changed the cast.

Top Gear 2016 is very bad for newcomers. We all got used to the Clarkson, the small guy and the old guy. Old Top Gear had soul and all around was just a pleasure to watch. The new show is just like a copycat you see in other countries that try to make their own show with similar people but they fail and will fail always.

R.I.P TOP GEAR 2015"
Top Gear,Was amazing but has gone trash!,"The 10 out of 10 was for when Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. The best trio in the world were funny and just really enjoyable to watch but when Chris Evans took over it just went from 10/10 to 1/10 in just 1 episode. It has improved with Matt and the others bit not amazing like it was and it will never be the same"
Top Gear,end of a great show!!,"if u love cars u're definitely going to fall in love with show from the very first season. i can still remember vividly when there was Jason Dawes instead of James may now.. i fell in love with this from the very beginning..i mean i had to download the whole seasons. i watched each and every episodes. watched it for long 6 years.. i taught me more about cars and motoring than i would ever learn..specially from Jeremy, Richard and James...loved their friendship, their jokes, their nasty little laughs, their explanation or should i say exploration of cars. their reviews about the cars are still the best than any other top gears. i m sure there are plenty of top gears now...starting from Australia to Zimbabwe. it rips my heart to see my favorite show ends in this way..such a tiny little matter turned into a big fuss..it wasn't necessary..but we know all good things should come to an end so thats it i guess.but top gear will be missed!! I'm sure as hell going to miss it..."
Top Gear,By far the best car show ever made!,Comentario no disponible
Top Gear,Amazing 13 year run of a show from good to better to best,"Commenting on the Clarkson-Hammond-May trio only.

These guys started out with a pretty good show and they just kept getting better. No other TV show ever lived this long and achieved the level of excellence of Top Gear. All three presenters have been really sharp, funny and dedicated to their job. Even if you don't give a toss about cars you've got to check out a few episodes of this show.

A lot of people give the BBC a hard time for sacking Clarkson. I'm sure they knew it was going to be their loss, not Clarkson's. But as James May said they had no choice given the circumstances.

But we got over 10 years worth of excellent TV from these guys already.

If you're new to Top Gear maybe check out some of the road trip episodes, e.g., the relatively recent Burma one."
Top Gear,Gave the new crew a chance - but they blew it,"Update in 2021: The new crew started well but gone down. The show is now pretentious, boring, and uninspiring.

Freddy is the nicest of the group, but he is unoriginal, and his car knowledge is lacking.

Harris is very knowledgeable but his personality is becoming annoying. The way he thinks he is better than everyone else, and the way he accepts the practical jokes without participating makes it look like he is being bullied even though he is not.

The other guy, Paddy, well he is just boring yet loud. Very few redeeming features if any at all.

Top Gear in its prime (2003-2015) was the best. It was smart and funny. Kids learned something from it. The jokes were clever, the fun was authentic and the presenters were natural and down to earth. This new group is none of those things (Freddy is cool but out of his depth).

___________________ 10 stars when JC, RH and JM were the presenters. 5 stars with the new crew.

Other reviews has clarified why it went downhill so will not bore you but I have to say that LeBlanc is primarily an actor, an average one at that. I like him as Joey but he is merely an attractive, mildly charming man you meet at the bar - he is no Marlon Brando or Daniel Day-Lewis.

It seems to me that on Top Gear he is only acting when presenting the show. However, there is no script, so there are no lines to memorise and that is where you can see he lacks: 1- extensive car knowledge like the old crew and Harris, 2- any show-hosting abilities like the old crew and Rory, 3- any personality.

I'm afraid LeBlanc is failing when trying too hard to be funny without a script, or he is just dull as a presenter. Sorry mate. He is dragging the show down. The producers should not be focusing on him only. Give the others (or better yet, someone else) a chance."
Top Gear,Old top gear is 10/10. Anything past 2015 is 1/10,"I TRIED watching the Top Gear past 2015, but with Jeremy, Richard and James' departure, the show is simply AWEFUL. BBC and Top Gear made what's probably the biggest mistake in Prime Television HISTORY, by firing the Top Gear presenters who had been with the show for over 20 seasons, and now, they're trying to fill the shoes of Giants, with a rag-tag bunch of idiots... I honestly don't know who any of these new people are, and frankly, I don't care.

I tried today watching the new ""Nepal Special"" where 3 random guys take 3 £6000 cars for a drive through Nepal, but it's simply not entertaining. And they think that being mischievous and screaming like a child, is going to make it seem like they can somehow bring levity to a really boring situation (almost like these youtubers who scream and act fake, just in an effort to seem funny).

So here's my rating: Anything before 2015 is 10/10 Anything after 2015 is 1/10"
Top Gear,Best Car programme ever!,"If you like cars, then this programme is just simply amazing. Unlike most programmes that are in this genre, the programme has survived a beyond 20 years at the top, and not many programmes come close. 5th Gear on five does come close, but it just doesn't have the heart or the dedication that Top Gear does.

While the people on 5th Gear only talk about cars, the Top Gear crew talk about everything that is to do with cars, and not just the cars themselves. For example, they have ""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car"" where a celebrity goes round their track to see how fast they are. And once, they decided to test the Toyota Pickup's claim of being the ""the toughest car on the road"" by basically ramming it into stuff, and putting it on a building that got demolished etc. and it still actually run. They also once tested if you can run your diesel car off of Vegetable Oil (you can, although your exhaust smells like a bag of chips).

Overall, this programme's great and a show you must fit into your weekly schedule, gets 10/10"
Top Gear,At its core it is a magazine motoring show. But it is also so much more!,"Top Gear is the epitome of what T.V entertainment is all about. I have reacquainted myself with Top Gear after not watching it really since the early nineties and it certainly has come a very long way. Almost everything is executed brilliantly on this show and it makes everything work. For example, undoubtedly the presenters have enormous comedic value (especially Jeremy's dry humour) and chemistry, and they work well together and have as much fun as possible in the process. That is the underlying factor of this programme - pure unadulterated fun. The music, filming and editing is also superb. And this is all before the cars themselves.

Another great aspect of the show I found is that although it's not hard to guess their target audience, as this does seem a predominantly male show, I found it is enjoyed by all ages and both genders alike. That is one of the amazing aspects of the show, its aptitude to extend beyond the target audience and having a broader appeal to even people who acknowledge cars in their lives to be simply nothing more than 'four wheels and an engine' to them.

It does have its sensible practical side, but it is quickly overshadowed by then not taking itself an ounce seriously in the next review or discussion. There is no compromise sometimes, if a particular presenter dislikes a car, boy do they like to express it, but in a funny way.

The show is a fantastic combination of elements that make it compulsive viewing. You have the varying and humorous personalities of the presenters, the controversial comments of Jeremy Clarkson (who tells it exactly how it is), the cars themselves, the music as mentioned before and its intelligent touch. It is not completely mindless even though it would appear so with some of the pointless but nevertheless hugely entertaining challenges.

For me it is a dream job. They frequently jet to exotic locations to test the worlds most powerful and exotic cars. Take part in both ridiculous but ridiculously entertaining challenges that make no sense. Just about everything that entertaining T.V is, is incorporated into the show and becomes so much more than a magazine motoring show."
Top Gear,Old and new,"I'm giving this review purely for the older seasons with Clarkson, Hammond and May. The seasons after 'the golden days' don't even come close to the '10' I gave.

Every season produced from 2016 is sloppy and lacks humour, while the camerawork stays fine. Truly masterworks are a thing of the past, 2015 and earlier that is."
Top Gear,Monty Python for Gearheads,"Even with an appreciation for cars, I routinely overlook automotive programming beyond racing due to their dry, technical nature. Recently- discovered Top Gear (UK) shatters the image, with hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May providing narrative styles and tastes which contrast as much as their physical appearance. From their regular features such as their unsparing reviews of the top models (without commercial influence), ""Stars in Sensibly Prices Cars"" and the ""Cool Wall"" to their adventures and challenges, the boldness and originality of the endeavors and cheeky humor of the hosts is reminiscent of Python at its absurdist best. Thankfully, BBA America provides ample opportunity to catch up on this under-appreciated show."
Top Gear,"10/10 the Clarkson era, 2/10 everything since.","Seldom in the whole history of television has a tv show crashed & burned so catastrophically as Top Gear has in recent years. Until 2015 Top Gear was literally the greatest show on earth, and 350 million would tune in each week to follow the hilarious car based antics of Clarkson, Hammond and May, and the best on screen chemistry since the Marx Brothers or even Laurel & Hardy. Then came 'Punchgate', and since 2016 we've had to suffer the obnoxiously loud Chris Evans, the nice but dull Matt leBlanc, and most recently a Dirty Sanchez tribute act - as hard as they try, none will ever escape the gigantic shadow of the 'holy trinity'. Meanwhile Top Gear just staggers on like a punch-drunk ex World Champion who doesn't know when it's time to quit."
Top Gear,"An Absolute Scream, Best thing on TV.","Without a doubt the best programme on TV, it's about the only thing on the BBC that is worth the Licence Fee. I can't wait for the new series in the autumn, I have just been watching the Polar Special, where Jeremy and James in a pick up truck, race Hamster on a dog sled, (with his white teeth) to the North Pole. Brilliant viewing and how Jeremy or James didn't kill each other with an ice axe we will never know! This programme just keeps getting better, and the format shouldn't be changed in any shape or form, Lets hope they can keep those doom and gloom health and safety idiots at bay, otherwise it will be just like any other motoring programme. Rubbish!"
Top Gear,the over all bets show on TV,"top gear is viewed in over 100 countries around the world in more then 30 languages and is nothing short of the one of the best television shows of all time. i have fallowed the show since the first episodes before James may became one of the presenters and to say that the show continues to get better would be an understatement. with every passing season what ever my expectations were set by the previous seasons have always been blown out of the water with ease. from the first seasons were they showed the world grannies that could do donuts to the latest seasons were they have crossed entire continents with cars that could barely run all the while completing impossible challenges along the way. in the end i highly recommend this series to any one young, old, rich, pore, auto enthusiast or out in out tree huger because you would have to be mental not to like this show."
Top Gear,A fantastic programme,"Some hate it. Lots more love it. The truth is, is that you don't have to be a petrol head to love this show. I myself couldn't care less about cars, but I tune in to every new episode. The presenters make the show what it is - Clarkson is extremely opinionated, not everybody's cup of tea but he is extremely funny at times and I enjoy watching him. May and Hammond both contrast nicely - the laddish banter makes the show extremely watchable. While the main series are very good - the segments beautifully filmed and composed - I really would encourage watching the specials as well. Overall, a thoroughly entertaining, funny and engaging show."

The Cartel,"Very good stuff! from the book ""el cartel de los sapos""","I was in Colombia while this series was on TV there. I had watched 1 or 2 episodes and they had stroke me with their very good acting, and production. I was amazed, because I had this image of telenovelas... Like some boring novelas that I had seen before...This is totally different. ""El cartel de los sapos"" was the first book I read in Spanish, when I got to colombia. This series is based on the book, although all the names have been changed. . First of all, the story is based on real events. ""Fresa"" or ""Fresita"", the narator, is called ""la Flor"" or ""Florecita"" in the book and in real life. He served a jail sentence in the U.S and is now out. Oscar Varela's real name was Orlando Henao... And so on. The story is the story of narcotrafic in Colombia, over the last 20 years. The only real name they kept is Escobar, but you have plenty of internet sites explaining who are the characters in real life. Orlando Henao, Diego Montoya (who was n°2 most wanted man in the FBI list, right after Ben Laden), and many others.

Very good actors. Very good... Technically it's well done. I'm watching the series now, a friend of mine brought me the DVD's from Colombia. I have all the episodes, and believe me it's worth it. If you have questions don't hesitate...

PS: a new season is coming in 2009!"
The Cartel,"Great TV series about the mafia and drug dealers, worth watching","Very good and thrilling TV series. At first I thought it would be similar to traditional Latino soap operas, but then I came to realize it tackles serious issues and present quite realistic picture of the Columbian mafia. The whole idea about displaying the world of drug cartels is very challenging. 'El Cartel de los Sapos' follow an interesting plot, filled with fascinating dialogues and amazing acting. I think Manolo Cardona shows remarkable acting skills. I wish he does well in USA and hope to see him in many more successful American movies in the future. Anyone who is looking for non-American series with meaningful script and persuasive actors, I recommend not to miss this one. Watch 1-2 episodes then decide whether you like it or not."
The Cartel,Excellent!,"As the daughter of Colombian immigrants to the USA and having lived in Miami for the past 30 years I can truly attest to the veracity of this series. The production value is high with authentic locations, props, wardrobe,etc. I was impressed by the image and sound quality on the DVD set because most Hispanic productions cut costs and this most important part of production suffers. Caracol has produced a top of the line show and one of which they can be proud of. The actors are all great, with some being superb such as Robinson Diaz as El Cabo and Julian Arango as Guadaña. Manolo Cardona has shown he can be a Hollywood leading man any day and I suspect it won't take long for us to see him there. It is a slice of the lives of the cocaine cowboys with never a dull moment. You will want to know what happens next at the end of each episode. As the previous post stated, ""The Sopranos"" a la Colombian. I advise you to get/rent the DVD set because the series shown on Telemundo is badly cut and the viewer looses out immensely."

Mindhunter,Just get us Season 3,I wanted to see something like Zodiac for a long time and couldn't find something and then my friend suggested to watch this and my mind is blown. David Fincher gives something that literally no other person could give. It has a perfect pacing and the pilot is for character introduction and the second episode is due character development. And from the 3rd episode the series starts in a full fledged way and boom you get what you are looking for it's one of the best and very-very enjoyable. Fincher is the MVP here and he does his job perfectly. It's so good that I'm ready to beg Fincher to start it's production ASAP.
Mindhunter,So disappointed there will be no season 3,Today's choices for decent dramatic programming is very spotty so when I saw that Mindhunter was canceled I couldn't be more disappointed. This was an excellent show about the start of the FBI's profiling program. It was well made and acted and now it's gone. The first two season were great though so it is definitely worth watching. There were no story lines that required a third season to wrap up so you won't feel cheated when you realize season two is the end. This show was about the criminals and how they were profiled rather than the FBI agents who did the profiling. It is still a 10 star show even without a third season.
Mindhunter,Fantastic,"Mindhunter is one of the better shows I've seen in some time. I really can't say enough good things about this amazing show that hasn't already been said but I still had to leave a review saying how much I enjoyed it. I've read some people think it gets slow at times but that's only because they're building the story and characters but it absolutely pays off. This series is so well done, from the acting to the directing to the writing to the etc, etc. Literally everything about this show is great. My only complaint is that there are only 2 seasons, this show had so much more to give and so many places they could've gone with the show but David Fincher only wanted to do the two seasons. It doesn't have a cliffhanger or anything so you don't have to worry about that. The ending is good enough but still disappointing they didn't do more, especially because this show is so universally loved. I know people say how shows are must watch all the time but this show really is a must watch."

Mindhunter,Brilliant!!,"Mindhunter is such a great show. Just read through the reviews to see what most people think about it. This is not your average cop show. It follows FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tech (Holt McCallany) as they attempt to understand and catch serial killers by studying their minds and psyches. This is the start of modern day serial killer profiling. It really digs in to why these monsters do the terrible things they do. This show is award worthy in every way...the acting, writing, directing, cinematography, production, etc, etc.! One of its creators is David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac, Gone Girl, The Social Network, etc). It has the same feel of a lot of his work so if you're a fan of his then you'll be a fan of this show."
Mindhunter,Brilliant Television,"This fictionalized show about the development of 1970's police forensic psychology and profiling is brilliant. It takes a premise, which could have been a documentary, and develops it around fictional and real characters. The scripts and storyline is brilliant. The acting by the main characters, especially the two leads, is fantastic. The Direction by David FIncher and others is movie quality. The 1970's attention to detail is just stunning. The interweaving of the brilliant role outs of real serial killers is just amazing to watch. The people and the scripts surrounding Manson, the Co-ed Killer, BTK, the Son of Sam and more are just fascinating. The is a thoughtfully constructed show and one of Netflix's finest additions. I wish I had watched it sooner."
Mindhunter,What?? No Season 3?!,"Well written, well cast, just well done. Why there isn't a 3rd season is beyond me.

I was a fan of Criminal Minds, so it was fun to think this is where the BAU started.

Having the story line based upon real criminals made this believable and interesting. (They didn't shy away from details, although a bit gruesome, was necessary to the plots).

The time period was well done, with the soundtrack truly adding to the atmosphere. The characters were not only believable, but you could empathize with them thanks to the great work of the actors in the cast.

It is criminal (sorry for the pun) that good productions like this eek out only 2 seasons while gossipy, glossy, air-brained 'reality shows' go on for 4-5 seasons or more. It's a travesty - this show was just too smart for the room."
Mindhunter,Please David Fincher read this:,"Mr. Fincher, Mindhunter is the greatest show ever created on TV. Please make another season. I know you're busy making a wonderful movies etc. But this show is just exceptional. Other than Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, I can't remember a TV series that has been so perfectly done as this. Your direction and the cast is so enjoyable. I have seen the series now seasons 1 and 2 three times and it just keeps getting better with each viewing. Hope you can find it within yourself to keep this going for many years coming. Every single actor that has played a notorious killer has been transformed into that person by your incredible make up team it is as if we are truly watching these people give their testimonies. It is very creepy that it is so believable, but that is just simply your incredible vision and direction. I think you probably the best modern day Director. Thank you so much again and praying for future episodes."

Mindhunter,"Fascinating, Suspenseful Drama Exploring The Origins Of Criminal Psychology And Profiling","For those of you who came here looking for something like 'Se7en', because you thought, well, it's from David Fincher and it's about serial killers, I have bad news: this is not that kind of show. But if you came here looking for something more like 'Zodiac', because you thought, well, it's Fincher producing a show about people investigating serial killers, you might indeed find something you like. And if you appreciate long-form storytelling focusing more on human drama than on action scenes, AND you're a bit of a science nerd on top of that (and by that I'm also implying you don't mind watching a show where people are talking most of the time), then, my friend, you are in for a treat.

The reason I absolutely love 'Mindhunter' is this: I'm the kind of person who always wants to know why we know what we know. Because we DIDN'T always know. Somebody had to make a start; someone had to make that first step, that first discovery and draw that first conclusion. Somebody had to be curious, probably persistent, maybe even daring in their quest for knowledge. The history of science is littered with warriors, some of whom we now celebrate and hold in high esteem - but we have a tendency to forget that many scientists also were tragic figures who had to fight against restrictions imposed by society and risked paying a high price - professionally and personally - for their fight against ignorance. And it's those aspects of science that I find so fascinating, and it's precisely those aspects that 'Mindhunter' is interested in; not the ""showy"", glamorous stuff, but the meticulous groundwork and the personal human drama inherent in the quest for knowledge. And if you, like me, have a morbid curiosity for all the darker aspects of human nature, it surely doesn't hurt that the particular branch of science whose origins this show explores is that of criminal psychology: the science which tries to understand how the minds of criminals work and what causes them to commit their crimes.

As you might have guessed, 'Mindhunter' isn't concerned with shoplifters or what goes on inside the head of someone who commits insurance fraud, but rather with criminals whose behavior is a tad more serious (like, you know, murderers who have a penchant for engaging in sexual activities with their victims' severed heads - stuff like that). And it isn't a documentary either; although the characters are based on real people and the show offers a realistic portrayal of serial killers, this is a dramatized account of events made for our entertainment. And entertaining it is, and on a high artistic level at that: the performances are fantastic; cinematography, editing and direction bear the clear trademark of the master filmmaker who produced and partly directed this (though it must be said that while Fincher appears to be the creative leader, the project was brought to him by one Charlize Theron who owns the rights to the book upon which the show is based and also serves as a producer, and the excellent teleplay was predominantly written by Jennifer Haley and the show's credited creator Joe Penhall).

To sum it all up: 'Mindhunter' is a show that takes full advantage of its format; this is long form storytelling as it was meant to be, and while it probably doesn't work for people with short attention spans, the patient viewer is rewarded with a fascinating, richly layered and suspenseful drama exploring the origins of criminal psychology and criminal profiling. Excellent stuff: 8 stars out of 10.

Mindhunter,A perfect 10,"Once in a while really AMAZING series appear on tv. Mindhunter is one of them. Every aspect of the show is a perfect 10 - the ultimate essence of noir crime. Intelligent, dark, disturbing. Why this show has not won every award possible is beyond me. The cast is top notch. Esp. Anna Torv's performance is outstanding. Cameron Britton who portrays Ed Kemper let u easily forget that it's a show. It feels so real, so raw. There are some more interviews with other suspects/killers, all let u peak into an abyss as cruel and dark as it can be. A twisted mind. If u are up for something truly unique and innovative in the usually rather stereotype crime bla, mindhunter is your antidote."
Mindhunter,"Extremely good, but was sadly canceled.","""Mindhunter"" is probably one of the best series I've ever seen.

I find people's psyches extremely interesting anyway, which is why this series felt like it was made for me.

To see how serial killers are questioned here to really define their kind for the first time is just pure excitement.

The serial killers' costumes are also spot on.

Even in the 2nd season, which unfortunately turns out to be rather poor in most cases, there is not a hint of a reduction in quality to be seen here, but the series even steps up a notch.

I find the decision to cancel the series just cheeky without giving us a satisfying ending.

I understand the hiring was financial, but I would definitely rather see another season of Mindhunter than the 100th Netflix miniseries with the same boring plot."
Mindhunter,I almost gave up one this one..,"I almost gave up on this around the 2 episode. Something told me to hang in there, and I'l glad I did. If you're fascinated by the psychology and methodology of a serial killer, you should watch the entire series. It does start off slow, but well worth the wait. When it comes to ""Mind Hunter,"" patience is a virtue!"
Mindhunter,Can't Watch Just One Episode,"Mindhunter is a 10 episode series on N'flix that hits a home run with me. First of all, David Fincher can do no wrong in my eyes, blending trance-like music with scenes that are unforgettable. He does this a few times and my goodness he's the master at it. Every scene, every line...well-constructed and nothing wasted.

Mindhunter gets into your head very quickly and not only for the content, but for the era it is held in. If you weren't born in the 70's, that's OK because the producers here have done a masterful job in recreating America in that decade. I honestly don't know how they did it scene after scene.

Mindhunter is a series where each character leaves an indelible mark on your psyche. The content is deep and makes you wonder. Don't forget to hug mom. I give it a 10 on the ""bingeable"" meter."
Mindhunter,Flawless investigation Netflix series,"I'm beyond fascinated by the study of the criminals as weird as they may sound so this hit the spot to me kinda like a delicious meal! The other thing is David Fincher the director of the pilot is one of my all time favorite humans/famous beings! Mindhunter has a wonderful tranquil ambient soundtrack throughout and immersive acting. It'll creep you out, intrigue you, and even make you wanna sympathize with many of the characters.

Also I'm rewatching for the second time, I originally saw when back in its prime and loving every bit again, I'm sure season 2 is just as good; I'll watch that soon. They're needs to be a lot more adult crime shows rated TV-MA, it's a million times better than most! Highly recommend to anyone that doesn't mind learning about monsters that did sinister crimes!"
Mindhunter,How can we get ahead of crazy if we don't know how crazy thinks?,"I'm spoiled for good quality TV shows that are intriguing and make me think while entertaining along the way. So many shows I watch the first episode and can't even get through it because its so predictable or cookie cutter. I'm excited I've found a new one to enjoy. And even though it is set in the 70s, its very relevant for today. Crazy takes on many forms. Back then it was ""sequence killers"" prior to term ""serial killer"" being used. Today its crazy mass shooters. I love Ford's desire to learn. I've watched 2 episodes and looking forward to the rest. And BTW the soundtrack is amazing!"

Mindhunter,Enter the psychopath's mind,"Two episodes in and I'm already hooked. Technically speaking, this series is very good (it's directed by David Fincher, of course it's good) and it stays true (so far) to the real-life crimes it was based on. I can't say the same for the characters, and how close they are to the people who really did this work, but considering their names are different and the book they adapted wasn't some sort of biography, most of their personal (love) lives must be fictitious or at least overtly dramatized.

You see, this series here isn't some kind of good cop, bad cop chase villains and shoot and explode a lot of stuff and at the end of the day (or episode) they go back to their wives and sleep like babies. No. There are way too many series like that, so search elsewhere if that's what you want, because you won't find that here.

Mindhunter is slow. Very slow. At first it might look like an simple thriller but actually it tells the story of two FBI agents in their pursuit to, as very precisely said by Holt McCallany's character, ""understand how crazy thinks"". But that doesn't come easily. Crazy is crazy. You gotta be crazy to understand crazy. But that doesn't stop naïve Holden Ford from interviewing the most despicable real-life psychopaths alive in America in the late 70's to develop the ideas that will become the tenets of the criminal profiling system.

As I said before, Mindhunter is directed by David Fincher, and as expected from his work, it's impeccable, both pacing and cinematography are top-notch. At the end of the episode you will be like ""wait, that's it?"" as the credits roll and the song keeps playing like the story is still going on. And somehow you are watching the next episode.

Writing and dialogue are great too. All very natural and haunting. Damn psychos could very much be the real ones. And that gets me to the acting, from what I've seen there's enough to say it's fantastic. The characters are brought to life by the actors. Also, the chemistry between characters Holden Ford and Bill Tench is incredibly real and sometimes, even through the bleakness of their work's nature, hilarious.

To finish off, I'll just say the biggest review cliché: Mindhunter is not for everyone. I know you know everyone says it, but it's truer in this case. If my review and the trailer got your attention, you gotta watch it. If it didn't, you'll probably hate Mindhunter. That's how it goes."

Mindhunter,Brilliant,"(Updated after Season 2).

1979. Agent Holden Ford is attached to the FBI's Behavioural Sciences Unit, headed by veteran agent Bill Tench. A new type of killer is emerging, one that kills regularly and without apparent motive. Due to the lack of motive, it is difficult to profile and apprehend the perpetrator in a murder investigation. In order to reduce this knowledge deficit, Tench and Ford set out to question incarcerated 'sequence killers' and build up a database of their backgrounds, behaviours, drivers and motives in order to make apprehending such criminals easier in future.

Brilliant drama series, largely based on a true story, with the names of the main characters changed. (Interesting fact: the true-life character Holden Ford is based on, John Douglas, was the inspiration for the character of Jack Crawford in the Hannibal books and movies.).

Well-told, showing how behavioural science evolved as a means of identifying and apprehending serial killers. Quite fascinating, especially when you consider that as recently as 1979 nothing was really known about serial killers' motives or profiles. In 1979, the expression 'serial killer' wasn't even a term! (Bill Tench's real-life character coined it).

The individual cases are quite riveting, and show the new method of profiling in action. Also shows that, like with any new, revolutionary idea, hitting upon the idea is only half the battle - convincing others, especially those you rely on to follow through on your work - in this case prosecutors, superiors, other law enforcement officers - is the other half.

Good character depth. Each of the main characters is clearly drawn and brings their personality, issues and hang-ups to the job.

On that note, the only negative aspect initially is the character of Holden Ford. I often found him irritating - cold, over-thinking, nerdy and paranoid. The episode involving the teacher was the low point of the series and a great example of the downside of Ford's personality. Maybe that's the point - what makes him brilliant also makes him a dingbat.

Season 2 isn't quite as interesting as Season 1. While S1 showed them interviewing convicted serial killers, evolving their theories and processes and building their processes, S2 largely deals with one particular case. While it is reasonably interesting, and does show some of their newly-developed techniques in action, it largely involves old-fashioned police grunt work, so is nothing new and is even dull at times. I kept feeling like the story was going in circles without developing. That's how police investigations are, I suppose, so is quite realistic. Just not that exciting.

Season 1: 9/10. Season 2: 8/10."

Vinland Saga,this show changed me,"Vinland saga is nothing like any anime, show or even story I've seen before. The animation is amazing, the story telling is incredible and the characters feel so real and life like it adds so much weight to the events unfolding.

Everything about this show is amazing, but the one thing on top is the core message of the story. ""You have no enemies."" is such a vague statement at first and you don't seem to understand what thors means. As you get through season 1 and then onto 2 you realize what he and the other adults in the story were talking about. Thorfinn is definitely on the way to being one of my favorite MCs ever.

Vinland Saga,This has to be one of the best animated series.,"The story teaches the gruesome history of humankind and where it leads eventually if it goes down the road of the most hellishest of hells.

The world we live in right now is also surrounded by misguided notions of power which nobody truly wants, all a human wants is peace and love and to experience it in abundance. But maybe without knowing hell we cannot know heaven, without experiencing torment it seems we won't value euphoria.

Thors realized this as he tried to embark those values on his son who had to go through this journey to understand the value of it. This series is a gift to the world of living.

Vinland Saga,A potential upcoming classic!,"When we talk about what constitutes a great cinematic universe, opinions always differ. Some like it realistic, whilst others don't. Some like the story fast paced, whilst others don't. Some like the characters being original and grounded in a sense of reality, whilst others prefer the generic, more idealistic, style of character that's more grounded in fantasy. I, for one, prefer a realistic setting with relatable characters that develop in an understandable way given the realistic circumstances. I also like it at a pace that keeps the story interesting, whilst also not rushing it making the story feel underdeveloped and difficult to comprehend.

This anime has got it all. Everything from the historical aspects, to how it establishes its cast, all the way to the wide array of emotions it's managed to surge within me during such a short amount of time, is just phenomenal...and we're only five episodes in. Also, don't even get me started on the animation quality and the splendid use of CGI.

This is how CGI's supposed to be used to make an animated story feel real. This, is amazing.

Making characters feel realistic and relatable, whilst also grounding them in a story that's only been on for 100 minutes, give or take, is amazing. Movies can do this, because they ""only"" need a crescendo like build up that's more often than not really fast paced, and end it all with a climax built up from the accumulated emotions of the main character. A television series needs to do all of that, and at the same time also keep the viewer interested through a much slower pace.

An amazing example of how Vinland Saga handles character grounding came from episode four of this series. Seeing Thors handling the situation at hand the way he did felt realistic, because of how the series already had developed him as a character. Some might argue his ideals were naive, and I might agree, but that doesn't make his actions feel any less real.

But, forget about Thors and his ideals for a second. Forget the fantastic animation quality of the episode and lets for the love of God forget how unrealistic it actually is to jump ten meters straight.

Let's focus on Askeladd. We'd already seen a glimpse of him during the previous episode, where he shows up and immediately establishes himself as the slippery kind of crook guy that doesn't hesitate to step on any kind of honor to get what he wants. What's truly amazing about this next episode is seeing Askeladd handling Thors and their diametrical ideals confronting one another. The respect Askeladd managed to feel for a man whose view of the world really is his polar opposite, as well as the complex array of emotions he felt during the episode just added another level of layer to his character.

That's grounding a character in a story, and that's doing it in just one episode. That, is superb.

I've seen some compare this to Attack on Titan, and I get it. A main character that's growing through a search for revenge and all that jazz. The series I'd like to compare this to would rather be early Berserk and early Game of Thrones, though. The fact that these two shows were able to build a believable universe with an intriguing plot during such a short period of time with relatable emotions built upon actual realism is what made them true masterpieces.

I'm not saying Vinland Saga will ascend. I'm not even saying it will keep on delivering.

I'm saying it's already a masterpiece."
Vinland Saga,Vinland Saga,"Story The story is about revenge and the growth of are main character as his views change from a boy to a pure blooded viking. While the show is slow paced the characters and action will hold your interest.

Art The art in the show is really well done since it's made by Wit Studio the same people who do Shingeki no Kyojin and many other damn good looking anime. Unfortunately the only part in the anime that looks bad at times is the sea and for a viking show that's kinda bad but since the rest of the show looks so good i'm willing to overlook the bad cgi water.

Music Hmm music is 50/50 for me while it sounds good like the op is one of my fav this season but the rest of the music doesn't really fit a viking show now it is good just for me doesn't really fit the setting.

Character So far I've really liked the characters they look and act like vikings and i'm enjoying are main character growth.

Enjoyment I love this show so far and i've only heard good things from the manga readers so i'm really looking to see more from the story."
Vinland Saga,Season 1 = GREAT. Season 2 = A preachy mess.,"You can safely stop watching after season 1 concludes. Though it ends on a bit of a cliff-hanger, there's enough closure for you to imagine countless ways the gaps could be filled in. It is tense, brutal, engaging, and nearly perfectly paced. Anti-violence without being overt about it. A well-balanced (fictious) look at the turn of the millennium (the first one).

But the second season? Oh God, the second season...where to begin. For brevity's sake:
The pacing stinks. It is a slog fest.


Too much introspective ""poor-me"" dialogue


I've already said too much. But, don't believe me? Watch Season 1. I bet you can't take your eyes off the screen. Then watch season 2. I bet the batteries on your remote go dead from fast forwarding so much."
Vinland Saga,Not great,"There may be an interesting story to be told considering the source material, but the anime is not really great. The characters constantly have to tell the audience what they are feeling (this is a shortcoming of many animes tbh), be it spoken word or ""inner"" monolog. There are lots of exaggerated dumb noises and dumb looks on peoples faces to telegraph that they are surprised. Thorfinn's constant whining gets annoying. Thorkell is portrayed as a complete moron. Sublety at its best. Becomes boring pretty quickly."
Vinland Saga,For real men,"As all Masterpieces you it's either love it or hate it. There is no in between.

Season 2 delivers lore like never seen before comparable only with the greatest anime titles of all time and is on par with beloved anime like AOT , Code Geass and more overall.

Bare in mind this is not a senseless fights oriented anime but deals with all kind of elements of human nature including war, valor and fame but also deals with the struggles of simple men trying to live a peaceful life amidst the waves of chaos and destruction that tend to appear and disappear as fast as a full circle of human life.

Its season is its own chapter and the hype is real for season 3, I honestly can't wait!"
Vinland Saga,Season 2 is the best thing I have watched in my life,"I've never written a review before on this website, but after just finishing season 2 I'm so blown away that I feel called to do so. Without revealing any spoilers, season 1 is action packed with fun fight scenes and interesting characters, with hints at deeper messages. The second season is far less action packed but goes all-out with deeper messages about life. The charector development is absolutely world-class especially in the second season and the author of the manga has clearly spent a lifetime researching various things to write Vinland Saga. I truly believe that this show is an absolute masterpiece."
Vinland Saga,peak,"Best 2023 anime best season Writing is peak bleach is good but this has better writing and demon slayer is good but it has no good writing in it like this peak season.

Thorfinn is so good in this season he resembles his father so much because his father said ""Thorfinn you have no enemies in this world dont hurt other pople who do no harm to you or your family""

Cyberpunk competes with this peak in 2023 to be honest these two might be tied as the best anime in 2023.

Vinland Saga,The Second best Wit Studio's Product after The first : Attack on Titan,"An EPIC Story with great characters. This masterpiece deserves anime of the year but again if Attack on Titan was not in existence. The animation and overall action scenes are visual treat not more comparable with Violet Evergarden. The problem with this is that Wit Studio missed an important thing that is an epic background score which are important for action scenes not to worry more about it because the scenes will grab you so emotionally that you will not require background music. Characters like Askeladd is not renewable in history it will force you to think about his strong intentions though he is not a antagonist or protagonist, This anime is not for War it is more than it"
Vinland Saga,A true warrior.,"For me, Vinland Saga is a masterpiece of animation.

From beginning to end it's amazing, at first you can hate certain characters, but then you can like them and feel something for them. It has a great antagonist, and the main character is not just a character.

It's definitely a true Viking story, there are some real details like the cruelty they possessed. Watching Thorfinn's development I loved, from being a boy to a warrior who has a lot to learn, it makes me love the character that much more, and knowing that he doesn't have the script on his side and that not everything revolves around him makes it more enjoyable.

I love the two openings, as well as the endings. It also has a great soundtrack for the suspense and action moments, as it has great battles that I loved watching for their animation and choreography.

I admit I cried with its ending because I didn't expect it, anime in general is unexpected because anything can happen. I can't wait to see more of this beautiful story, to see more about Thorfinn and to know if he will become a true warrior or not."
Vinland Saga,Great series that got even better with the new season,"This is just an outstanding anime series like no other. If the first season is more of a typical viking action-adventure, then the second season is a remarkable psychological drama, deconstruction of a typical viking hero and a story of rebirth. There are not enough words to convey the emotional impact of the second season. Such anime series are very rare, especially in our time of fan service, template isekai and other schlock. I'm glad that anime industry is still capable of producing something unconventional and bold, like it used to do back in the days when anime was less mainstream and valued originality over safe mediocrity."
Vinland Saga,A MUST WATCH,Comentario no disponible
Vinland Saga,Astonishing,"I found the first season shortly after it finished airing because I heard so it was also made by Wit and having such a good impression about AoT i thought I might give it a try. Let me say that I devoured those episodes, I couldn't move from the chair and I think I saw all of the season in a day and half. It was astonishing, Thors, Thorfinn, Askeladd, Floki, Canute. Such complex and interesting characters, i had to wait 3 years for season 2 but it was such a worthwhile wait.

Season 2 is about redemption, re-discovery, pain, loss, hope, despair, sadness, happiness and a whole other carousel of emotions. The journey is simply incredible, the horrors that mankind can inflict on each other and yet even after we realize them we still end up in this vicious circle. Can a man outrun his past? I don't know, but i can't wait to see Thorfinn's next adventures. The animation, voices, and music are perfect. I just wish Crunchyroll would stop censoring limbs and other gore stuff. Respect the creators work, don't censor them.

Also, both the opening themes do such a fantastic job of expressing the feelings i had for both parts of the season, incredible songs. It might not be as hyped as AOT, jjk or Demon slayer, but the story in Vinland Saga far surpasses them, it is simply a must watch."
Vinland Saga,Hold your horses,"The amount of 10 star reviews is ridiculous. Comparing it to the likes of Attack on Titan and FMA:B?!

Are you guys crazy or what? The story doesn't hold together nearly as well. The graphics are super beautiful but that means nothing if the story doesn't hold together.

First ever review. Do NOT be fooled by the rating."

Aggretsuko,We all are Aggretsuko: Entertaining depiction of real worklife issues,"For some time I avoided this. I am not a big fan of cuteness-overload and animals depicting humans. However, this show has taken my heart in one episode. It is funny and cute, yes, but what makes it so relatable, are the characters and situations that are all too real (at least, if one has experience with (japanese) worklife). This anime feels like a mirror for japanese society and quite a bit to some issues in the western countries, too. And the characters are neither black nor white - they have all their flaws and charms, yes, even this pig of a boss. I ended up watching the whole thing in one day and was sad arriving at the last episode.

It is clear: Regardless of culture, upbringing or gender - We all are a little bit Aggretsuko."
Aggretsuko,A Slice of Life That Handles Adult Themes in a Very Cute Way,Comentario no disponible
Aggretsuko,I have not seen such a mix of adorability and meaningfulness in my life before.,"I don't usually watch slice of life shows, but the premise of this show seems so quirky I wanted to watch it anyway. Slice of life shows just seem to be completely lacking of much interest to me because who wants to see more of the everyday anyway?

Well, I'm glad to say that this show changed my mind. There's something about this show that makes the everyday fresh and exciting -- everyone has completely lovable personalites and quirks, and there's something humble about this show that's rare to see. We can all relate to the idea of being the average joe who just want to let things out more wildly in life -- like a red panda playing death metal to release stress.

By the way, death metal 10/10. I didn't listen to metal before, but now I do. I'll pray everyday to Red Panda Metal Queen for her musical genius. I want to go buy a plushie of Retsuko and create a video of that plushie playing hardcore death metal. But unfortunately, I'm too lazy.

Cuteness 100/10. My kokoro got hit 1000/10. Life is meaningless without Retsuko 10000/10."
Aggretsuko,Loved every episode,"Having lived in Japan for over nine years, I thought this was such a humorous (and accurate) take on the life of a Japanese OL. It reminded me a lot of people I've met in Japan, (except for maybe Ton-buchou and Tsubone-san). The personalized theme music for some of the characters is great. Favorite characters: Super-classy Washimi, extremely well-balanced Gori-buchou and all around nice guy Haita-san. And of course the cutest lesser-panda ever, Retsuko, is just adorable. Patiently awaiting season 2."
Aggretsuko,Eagerly awaiting a second season.,"I'm a sociopath, but this show made me smile. Even if you've never worked a terrible office job, the juxtaposition of the art style versus death metal and the wonderful characters should be more than enough to enthrall you in this true-to-life animation. I cried out in anguish when I realized I finished the first season."
Aggretsuko,Funny and relatable anime,It's amazing how an anime with cute looking characters managed to be so relatable with working and personal life in today's society. Kudos to the Brazilian dubbing that did a great job with the voice actors and jokes/dialogues adaptions to Portuguese.
Aggretsuko,cute & hilarious social study,Cute and hilarious anime making fun of cliché everyday work and social situations... super witty & funny - love it! :))
Aggretsuko,"Entertaining concept, first season is best however","Entertainment value: 8 It's funny and silly, on and off it diverges from this and not all episodes are that funny or interesting. Season 2 is generally bad.

Visuals: 8 Simple but effective design.

Soundtrack: 7 Nothing special but it pairs well with the theme. Season 3 has some girl band songs with high production value.

Plot: 6 Nothing really surprising here, 1 season is good and 3 ok. Here too season 2 is quite uninspiering or interesting.

World building and depth: 7 It's the Japanese society with animals, nothing more to say really. It captures some aspects of Japanese society in an interesting way (hierarchy at work, romantic relationships, karaoke, friendship).

Characters and dialog: 8 Nothing deep per se but some truly hilarious interactions!

Total: 7"
Aggretsuko,This Show's Always on my Mind,"Every character brings something special to this series, and each and every one of them has several stand out moments. By the time you're done, you will have at least one character that you love and cherish as your own. Of course, nothing is stopping you from loving all of them."
Aggretsuko,"Decent use of two and a half hours, but not amazing","Aggretsuko is a 10-episode long Netflix original series made by Sanrio, the same company that made Hello Kitty. The characters have the same sort of general simplified design as Hello Kitty, with most of the primary female cast being chibi female characters with large heads, big eyes, and a small mouth.

However, unlike everything else Sanrio makes, this is very much a series directed at adults, as the main character of the series, Retsuko the red panda, is a miserable professional accountant, working in a large office building in Japan with a bunch of other anthropomorphic animals - yes, this is very, very furry.

Retsuko is the main character of this slice-of-life series, and it initially seems to be focused on her and her two coworkers, Fenneko the fennec fox and Haida the hyena, in their daily struggles against Ton, a literal chauvinist pig and a general jerk of a boss.

Retsuko is a little ball of misery at the start of the series - a total doormat who never says no, never stands up for herself, works too hard, stays far too late, is easy to push excess work off onto, and generally is a little ball of stress and anxiety that is constantly simmering beneath the surface, her only escape being escaping to the bathroom or a karaoke lounge at the end of the day to screech death metal to express how she really feels about her miserable life - something she is otherwise half-accepting and half in-denial about.

Frankly, it didn't exactly enthrall me at first - while the character designs were cute and the voice dubbing was excellent (I actually greatly preferred the English voices and script to the subbing), Retsuko was not really the most enthralling of characters, and her general misery sort of felt like a preaching to the choir type thing, with everyone being something of a shallow stereotype.

As the series goes on, however, two of the seemingly untouchable higher staff women in the office - Washimi the secretarybird secretary and Gori the gorilla who supervises marketing - end up taking an interest in Retsuko and take her in under their wing (so to speak). We get to see more and more of her coworkers, and come to recognize that they're not as shallow as they seem at first glance, and all have motivations for being the way they are, imperfect as those motivations might be. The result is that, over the course of the ten episodes, we get a better idea of what kind of people they are, as Retsuke gradually learns to take more control over her own life and be less of a pushover.

With ten 15 minute long episodes, the whole series clocks in at about two and a half hours in length, and the episodes all lead into each other - there's a great amount of continuity here, with the whole show being one continuous arc.

This series is very, very Japanese and is pretty anime as well - the first episode in particular parodies the common opening to many animes about young women, with the protagonist introducing themselves... at which point she twists her ankle and unleashes a loud metal scream. The overall pacing and choreography is very much what I'd expect out of a show made in Japan, with a number of scenes having that certain timing and shot aspect that I see a lot in anime. This isn't a bad thing, but it is very much a product of Japan, and a number of aspects of the show are very, very Japanese - which makes sense, as the show is set in a contemporary Japanese city and invokes the feelings of Japanese salarymen (or salarywomen, as the case may be).

This is definitely a show that feels like it is preaching to the choir a bit at first, but as it unfolds, it actually shows the consequences of actions, both positive and negative, as well as Retsuko growing as a person. Haida and Retsuko both learn to grow from their actions when they recognize that problems are of their own making and that solutions have to come from their own hands (though perhaps with the help of those around them at times). It actually helps to show why people behave in the way that they do, while simultaneously not actually excusing the behavior, as well as how to get along better with your coworkers (a vital skill). While early on, it felt sort of like a socially awkward horror movie, with ""No, quit sabotaging yourself!"" substituting for ""No, don't go in there!"", but by the end of it, it has presented a decent little arc.

I thought that this show took a remarkable maturity with its approach towards social masks, which is a major theme of the show, both implicitly and explicitly. Lots of shows go with the trite moral of ""be yourself"", but this show takes a much more complex view of things - that masks are not necessarily a bad thing and can actually make your life better, but at the same time, if you always wear a mask, you'll be miserable, as you can never truly be yourself. Knowing when to wear a mask - and what mask to wear - is important, as well as knowing when to let your mask slip a bit and show a different side of yourself to help you connect with other people.

This series was decent, and I watched it all the way through to the end, but at the same time, I never really loved it - on the whole, I was left feeling lukewarm. It is decent overall, but there's nothing that really stuck out to me. None of the characters were particularly amazing, but none of them were really deep enough for me to really care about them as people, either. I liked all the little touches, and it was fun watching the characters interact and listen to them bouncing off of each other, but in the end, I couldn't say that I had a favorite (or least favorite) character. There aren't any great moments of catharsis, and the show ends on a somewhat subdued (but hopeful) note.

Overall, I think it was worth the two and a half hours of my time I spent watching it, but I'm not sure if it really batted much above average - if you've got Netflix, it might be worth checking out, but if you don't, I don't think that this is the show that will change your mind and make you want it."
Aggretsuko,Rating this because I'm scared of Netflix cancelling all great shows,Aggretsuko 3rd season is so good. Netflix has another bojack horseman on their hands. Don't they dare ever cancel it or I'll have to go sing death metal karaoke about it.
Aggretsuko,"It started out great, but ended up becoming quite flaccid...","When I found ""Aggretsuko"" on Netflix I had never even heard about it before. I read the synopsis and decided to watch it, as I had nothing else more pressing to watch at the time.

Right, well, I will say that ""Aggretsuko"" is definitely an alternative anime in comparison to the countless other animes that come from Japan like an animated tsunami. So was that good or bad? Well, for me at least, it was good, because it stood out and was unique.

The series starts out quite nice, and I must admit that I was very entertained by it, especially when Retsuko started singing. That was just hilarious and it had me laughing every single time it happened.

However, the joy for ""Aggretsuko"" was short lived, because the air started seeping out of the show towards the last third of the first season. Whereas it was previously about all of Retsuko's aggression and her way of expressing this aggression, it turned into a sugar-coated love story. And that was just too much of a sudden change, and that had me getting off at the next stop, with little or no desire to get back on the ride and find out what happened to Retsuko.

""Aggretsuko"" started out wonderfully, but then it peaked all too soon and went fast down a steep hill, from which it seemed to do not recover."
Aggretsuko,I would give it negative stars if I could,"I liked the original shorts, so I thought I'd like this one (In fact, I thought they'd just compile the originals into 15-minute collections). Instead, I hate it because of what they did to the original. Instead of Retsuko being determined and capable like in the original, they turn her into a total wimp whose penchant for death metal is severely underplayed (of course, how would Netflix be able to instill its anti-feminist, anti-capitalist message if the female protagonist's coping strategy is actually effective in helping her deal with stress from her annoying coworkers and bosses) and who actively pursues having a boyfriend (she's voiced by Erica Mendez, the voice of Sailor Uranus, a canon lesbian character and one of the biggest badasses among the Senshi... Way to set feminism back/s) so she can become a housewife who doesn't have to work... WHAT?! Why not make it so the plot is about Retsuko rising to power in order to make the office more fair to women, or her and some of her friends (by the way, her friendship with Eaglette (I'm gonna use the names from the original shorts because this version sucks) and Ape Admin is downplayed for one with Zelda and Heinrich) start a metal band that goes on to become super-successful? Those would be MUCH more empowering! But no, Netflix has given us its horrible romantic fanfiction and expects us to like it. Avoid this version of the series at all costs, and instead look for the TRUE Retsuko."
Aggretsuko,A relatable show with a lovable cast of characters and a lot of heart,"I binged watched this series on Netflix as I was hooked on the first episode. It's both funny and sad to see the daily challenges in Retsuko's life. Retsuko is both overworked and isolated and the series shows her transform into a more confident and content person. The ensemble cast both adds to the craziness of Retsuko's life but sometimes also provides her refuge. One of the central themes in this show is how everyone is not what they first appear to be. Most of the characters get moments in Season 1 that show them as more than just caricatures in Retsuko's life and I found this to be one of the most endearing aspects of this show. Besides just being a good show, it's also a wonderful show that depicts modern life through a young woman's perspective and the specific challenges related to women in the workplace. If a funny, endearing, sincere and wonderfully feminist show is something you're interested in then I can't recommend ""Aggretsuko"" highly enough!"
Aggretsuko,Amazing show,"It's witty, hilarious and relatable. Between this and Bojack, I am clearly in love with animal shows that keep it real and funny."
Aggretsuko,Cannot Wait for Season 2,"As a metal head working in an accounting department, this show dang near mirrors my day!! Except I'm not a red panda. Or a girl. But still....this is a amazing show. I really enjoy the contrast of the artwork between the happy go lucky Retsuko, and the angry screaming/singing Retsuko."
Aggretsuko,Surprisingly great show. We all need season 2 so badly.,Comentario no disponible
Aggretsuko,"Obnoxious, but consistent","I just finished watching Aggretsuko, and I liked it overall, though it certainly has its strengths and weaknesses. All in all it's above average, but it is incredibly safe.

The whole gimmick with the show is that the cute red panda girl screams death metal as a stress relief mechanism at her medial office job, and it's actually consistently the least appealing aspect of the show in my opinion. The death metal comes out of nowhere, and the dubbing is clear as day as It's basically Nathan Explosion every time he does her screaming. It seems almost like it's going for a stylistic suck in this aspect, but it doesn't suck enough to loop back around to be hysterical like 12 Oz. Mouse as it's contradicted by it's clean, albeit simple art style. Fortunately these gags don't make up too much of any given episode. I wonder if this idea came to be with the popularity of Babymetal, a band which mixes death metal with J-Pop, often with humorous effect at the juxtaposition of abrasive instrumentals and cute vocals and pretty girl singers.

The art style is probably my favorite aspect of the show. It may be simple, but it certainly gets the job done, and the characters' simplistic designs add to their cuteness appeal. There's a large variety in the characters, and it's kind of funny to see such child-friendly designs engaging in an adult comedy.

It's nearly impossible for me to watch this show without drawing comparisons to countless others that have come before it that display its shortcomings. Aggretsuko is never as deep as Bojack Horseman, as beautiful as Zootopia, as edgy as Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, as weird as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, or as funny as The Office. What results is a show that does every aspect of an animated comedy decently, but hardly feels as original an idea as it seems to think it is, and never excels at any one thing.

The plot, if one could so much as call it that, is horrifically simple to the point of being mind-numbing. Even as far as dumb comedies go, not a whole lot of development happens in this show throughout the first season, whereas 12 Oz. Mouse, despite deliberately trying to be terrible in every aspect, managed a lot more story despite constantly wasting its own limited time on a regular basis. Unlike 12 Oz. Mouse, there's no depth or anything additional to take away from the characters besides what is shown on screen, and it's rare that I notice such a lack of nuance in shows like these nowadays.

That being said, I would certainly recommend this series to most interested in animated series. At 15 minutes per episode, it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome. I would have wanted more out of it, but it's cute and charming enough to pull above mediocrity. As a whole I'd rate it well above Panty & Stocking as it's very consistent, but that show's best episodes blow this one's out of the water."
Aggretsuko,"Funny, well written and oddly relatable!","In a anime with cutely drawn and colourful animals that live a life parallel to ours there is Tsuko. This 25 year old lady is the office doormat that's too timid to stand up for herself and ends up at the bottom of the food chain at work.

So how does she deal with all that pent up rage? DEATH METAL!!!! SCREAM YOUR RAGE AND BANG YOUR HEAD!

Anyone that's worked in corporate setting will recognized the type of people portrayed in this show. From the suck up to the boss to the bitter old woman that takes pleasure from pointing out others faults and failures.

The show is based on how real people would act not TV tropes making it a refreshingly different kind of show where the cute art style only adds to the charm as it hides what's truly on the inside.

The season's ending was disappointing but doesn't cancel what came before it so give it a watch."
Aggretsuko,"A flawed, but charming show that starts slow, ends poorly but is worth watching for the first three seasons.","Although off to a bit of a rough start with the first season, like lots of shows, Aggretsuko struggled to find their footing. But by the end of the first season, they had me hooked. Then the second and third seasons had my eyes glued to the action from start to finish.

The fourth season - honestly - was terrible. But the fifth season made up for it with better writing, although the series finale felt incredibly rushed, abrupt and unsatisfying.

The comedy and writing is what truly sells this show. How it's able to balance relatability with excessively ridiculous and unrealistic situations is nothing short of excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed how the relationships were handled in the first few seasons in particular.

Despite these shortcomings, Aggretsuko is honestly worth the watch. Especially the first three seasons, but perhaps not the following two."
Aggretsuko,It really does show you how being at work does suck at times!,Comentario no disponible
Aggretsuko,Office Dramedy with endearing characters,"This will cover all 5 seasons without spoilers. A sweet, extremely relatable dramedy about office drama and common social issues with endearing characters.

Each character reflects a common coworker personality almost everyone has and puts them into zany yet grounded life office issues. The main draw is how close to home the scenarios these characters are in, and how it looks at the situations under an optimistic and realistic lens. You will feel all the emotions the characters are feeling: stress, despair, hopeful, confident, etc.

The show does its best to keep things fresh and moving to avoid being boring and repetitive. The show is constantly introducing new characters and developing the preexisting characters by giving them new dynamics to the main character. The show balances between goofiness and drama perfectly.

That is, until the 4th season. I recommend leaving the show at the end of the 3rd season. At that point, the main arcs of the characters have mostly been completed and leaves the characters on a high note where you can gauge where their lives are heading. The last two season lost a lot of what made the show special, and I struggled to finish them. Watch them at your own risk.

I overlooked this show due to the animation and assumed it was a generic comedy. Mistake."
Aggretsuko,"AGGRETSUKO is surprisingly one of the most honest, relatable and best shows Netflix has.","First of all, let me start off with this: I need Season 2 so freaking bad. That's how good I think this show is. If you haven't watched it, seriously please go and watch it. It's really good. Or, if you want to read this review first then go ahead. (just go at your own risk; may contain spoilers)

I know: I'm late. It's June 2019, and I just started binging this show when Season 2 is already near. But hey, at least Netflix recommends me this show instead of nothing! Watched Rilakkuma and Kaoru, then it recommended me this. Boy: this is the best recommendation I've ever got!

The brutal honesty and how it relates to you is so excellent and so fine, it makes you feel like you're also part of their world or vice versa. Aggretsuko is basically a mundane worker's life, from the moments of being 'power-harassed' (in Retsuko's case) or something related to releasing all the anger contained by yourself. So accurate this is, I can't believe a freaking Sanrio property actually got made into this beauty.

But some parts of the show is also fantasy-typed, like the lovey-dovey parts and stuff. To be honest, I don't really care because workers tend to think this way when 'escaping work' comes to mind, so this is also fairly accurate. Not to say that I hate these parts!

Alright, that's it. AGGRETSUKO is by far one of the best Netflix anime shows I've watched. And when I say good: I mean really good (and I don't usually watch anime).

Go and watch it. The honesty brutally hurts, but at the same time it eases you with feel-good parts of its own. Go. Watch. Aggretsuko.

9/10"
Aggretsuko,You've got to see this!,"Excellent series! Characters dealing with adulthood, Sanrio anime style!"
Aggretsuko,"Dark, cynical, but funny as heck!","Stumbled upon this on Netflix and it's just an addictive show to watch. Quirky characters keeps the moving. If your down and out with your day, just watch an episode and you'll feel better!"

SWORDGAI The Animation,Weak plot,"The plot , characters, everything is a little boring."
SWORDGAI The Animation,stop watching it after first season. and regret I even started.,"I searched for a fun anime at netflix, and I saw this title. there are too many characters, and they are all dumb so you cant connect to them. The animation is repeated like 80's cartoon, it reminded me of He-man. each time Gay (gai) transformed his hand to sword, the same moon can be seen in the background."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Watchable,"If you want something exceptional this one is not for you. I watched it slowly and used it to fall asleep stimes. The plot is weak and blurry with too many characters. Imo the show manages to demonstrate the eternal human struggle between good and evil. And that is what i liked. The importance of our soul and the way we feel inside. Overall the idea was good, but the outcome could and should have been better."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Sloppy and stupid with a ridiculous concept to boot...,"Problem 1: anyone who touches a weapon of any kind basically turns into a demon controlled monster who wants to kill everyone. Why is that's problem? Well you can't care about characters if they cease to exist the moment they engage in the story.

Problem 2: There are so many characters that have nothing to do with the overarching plot, making the story confusing to follow.

Problem 3: the first rule of writing is: you have to play by the rules of the world you create. These writers just make up rules to fit the moment with no consistency. The world fees very undeveloped because they have no true rules to what the world is.

Problem 4: character motivations are obsurd and they make no sense.

Problem 5: No real good guys. Just people who don't turn evil as fast as others.

Problem 6: the actual plot is completely lost in a bunch of wild and non-sensical scenes that no one cares about.

Problem 7: (petty problem alert) The main character (Gai) is a tiny part of the story. Weird. Why name the show after someone who's almost never in it?

Here's the message of Swordgai - everyone is evil and weapons make them demons. The only not totally evil people are Buddhists who avoid violence. No matter how good someone may be, protecting themselves or others will turn them evil. The end."

SWORDGAI The Animation,All over the place.,"I just got so fed trying to understand the story that I felt a compulsive need to write this review. 1. Save yourself the trouble. The plot they created can itself be counted as one of the worst plot ever. It is so messed up that even writer doesn't understand what story to develop in the world he created. 2. Main characters have forced romance. Their background story is so messed up that writer abandons them mid way, It doesn't even matter if they are in the story or not. The ending doesn't match with premise they had built, main guy saves the world out of no where and no reason because suddenly writer realized near the ending that he was the main guy. 3. One of the worse story ever created (at least for what I've seen till now). It's like writer have created lots of different stories, now he had to to connect these stories with world he created, but he is really bad at playing puzzle, so he utterly fails to connect dots within the story making it easily the worst story ever created. 4. Now this point is for you if you are like me. If you think that I'm not here for the story / plot, etc. I'm only here for action scenes. Trailer shows people wielding swords, and sword fights are pretty good. Then I'll stop you here. This show by far has the worst fighting scenes ever created. though they tried adding 3d armors, but that is all it has. Very poor fight scenes. has no logic/ thrill involved.

Really dull and boring in every aspect. It is like animators and writers were challenged by someone to create worst possible show ever. If so, they passed with flying colors."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Thoroughly enjoyable,"I enjoyed watching this one quite a bit. Its not overly deep and the story is a bit fragmented but it is still a fun fantasy Anime. While it attempts to portray the inner struggle of its characters while they fight to retain their humanity and do good, it doesnt really manage to actually show true emotional struggle. The Artwork is lovely and the action scenes are quite enjoyable.

The dialogs are again not the most articulated, but they do serve their purpose. All in all it gives you the feeling that it can be much more than what it is and yet it is still great to watch.

Sometimes simple fun is great fun and this one is fun ! - it has me waiting to see the next part for sure."
SWORDGAI The Animation,Shitest show ever,The story doesn't make any sense. There is no point to watch it. Do not waste your time.
SWORDGAI The Animation,One you could live without...,"Let me preface this by saying, once I start watching something I have to see it through. This is one of the reasons I'm particular about what I watch. This anime really ought to have not been made. It's pretty dull and almost does the entire anime industry a disservice. I rated and wrote a synopsis for every episode so check that out if you want to get a feel for what happens in this series I won't spoil it in case you think I'm just hard to please. The mindlessness in the premise, the way the story unfolds and the like it's as if someone watched Deathnote in its prime plus some of Attack on Titan with a little Tokyo Ghoul and said hold my beer! Not in a good way though. The shows I've just mentioned have some major flaws (not doubting they are entertaining) so if someone found the path between them it would be a good show. This is not it. Mindless slaughter and characters as disposable as paper plates there is nothing holding this story together. The animation is clunky during fights and overall as I said the resources might've been better served elsewhere. Knowing how much time it takes to bring an anime to life gives me no joy in effectively trashing it but this does little to justify your time. Move on to better shows. The ratings I gave the episodes were based on the first episode onwards not against other anime in case you were wondering. So a 6 in an episode is a 6 compared to other episodes within the series and so on..."

SWORDGAI The Animation,Had potential,It's just a waste. This could have been way better. The plot was just all over the place. There were too many unanswered questions through the whole story. Don't watch it because it's just a waste of time. The ending succes too
SWORDGAI The Animation,The other reviews are not accurate,"I found this to be a highly enjoyable and interesting anime. The plot was clear and tangible. The special effects aren't the best, but it can be overlooked. I liked the character development the most about this anime, since the main characters including Gai and Matoba were likeable and flawed in a human way. The other reviews are rather unfair, since the story is quite good and it stimulates your imagination. I'm not sure what they expect. You should definitely give it a go and a chance and don't listen to them about the plot being hard to follow, that's ridiculous. A pity there won't be a season 3, since it would be very much appreciated- alas people didn't give it a chance and this is the result."

Charmed,Imaginative and Engaging,"This is a wonderful TV show with great episodes that, in serial fashion, depict a constant battle between good and evil. Evil, as in the Source, is very clever and wears many disguises. This is what's great about this show. Evil is never fully defeated, although the lackeys are destroyed quickly, the greater evil persists. This presents a constant challenge to the Power of Three and they must always be on their guard. Other WB shows allow the hero or heroine to win very easily and the hero or heroine is too sarcastic. Charmed, however, has the right mix of all elements and the writers appreciate that evil forces that are truly dangerous and formidable create a more rich, tense atmosphere. The fourth season was very good, and I liked Rose as Paige very much. The chemistry between the sisters also carries the show and their personalities seem real and three-dimensional, while other shows of this genre fail in that regard. This is one of the best written shows on television. It really deserves more critical recognition and respect, but if that doesn't happen, I'll still enjoy it."

Charmed,Fantastic show... until mid series,Comentario no disponible
Charmed,Huge Charmed Fan,"I don't get attached to TV shows, nor collect them on DVD..... except for Charmed. The supernatural aspects of the show are fun and do not seem to be taken too seriously.

The core group of actors have a fantastic chemistry and the relationships are so well developed. I like it just as much, if not more, to see how the sisters get through situations together, both magical and non-magical.

I would dare compare the character development and interpersonal relationships as well done as in a Jane Austin novel. You see their strengths and faults.

All the actors get a round of applause. Both Holly Marie and Alyssa get a standing ovation for becoming producers of the show. Well done ladies."
Charmed,"A harmless, fun fantasy show that gets really old really fast",Comentario no disponible
Charmed,Ahead of its time,"The TV show is beyond amazing. The storylines are great up until the final season, the character development is shown greatly, and the way they handled Shannon exit was great. The show featured empowered women way before feminism was so popular, and it showed how women could save the day as much as men!"
Charmed,"Starts good, progresses downhill","The first 4 series are good, entertaining, funny on occasion, but half way through series 5 it goes downhill...fast. The stories become ridiculous, the acting is unconvincing and wooden, and the special effects are less than special."
Charmed,Extremely Disappointing on the rewatch,"I loved this show as a kid, and rewatched it with my wife. The first season is good and has promise; however everything that follows is empty and suffers from poor. Prue, Piper, and Paige are good, but Phoebe absolutely dreadful. Plus, Leo is the hero of the show. I don't know why the writers didn't take show serious. Instead, they constantly resorted to slapstick, which didn't align with often serious circumstances."
Charmed,Glad the series is out on DVD...finally.,"Very pleased to see Season One out on DVD, we've been waiting awhile for it. The quality of the shows on the DVDs is fantastic...however there are no ""bonus materials"" whatsoever. As I don't usually buy a DVD for the extras, I'm not that concerned over it...however I am accustomed to them being there typically.

Also, be aware the packaging is on the unusual side...thinline cases, one per disk (6-disk set for Season One), rather than the usual bulky foldout packs. I actually enjoyed this factor...I'm always struggling with the foldout packs.

If you like the show, you'll be pleased with the DVD quality...but keep in mind with the box set currently released, that's all you're getting...just the show."
Charmed,Messy,"The first theee season are genuinely good television and improve every year. But unfortunately, the show was never able to get to those Same high's again. Only getting worse and worse every subsequent season."

Charmed,The Power of Three,"Okay, I just watched one episode a few week ago, and that was it for me. I AM HOOKED! I admit that this show is very addicting! Now, my Sunday's night are booked.

Performances of such talented actors truly ignites the screen. Piper, Phoebe, Paige, Leo, and Cole are such great, and very talented performers. I hope this show will run for a very, very long time. I will truly recommend this show to all my friends. Thumbs up to the creator, writers and all the crew. This show rocks!!!!"
Charmed,Best Ever.,"Charmed is an American television series that originally aired from 1998 until 2006, when its network, The WB, ceased operation.The series was created in 1998 by writer Constance M. Burge and was produced by Aaron Spelling and his Spelling Television company, with the show runner being writer-director Brad Kern. The series narrative follows the four Halliwell sisters, Prue, Piper, Phoebe and, later, Paige, the culmination of the long Warren line of powerful, good witches. The sisters, despite being perceived as normal by the non-supernatural community, are known as The Charmed Ones, whose prophesied destiny is to battle against evil beings, such as demons and warlocks, in order to protect innocent lives from being endangered. Each sister possesses unique magical powers that grow and evolve, whilst they also attempt to hold normal working lives in San Francisco. Keeping their paranormal identities separate and secret from their ordinary lives forms part of the series' tension and challenges, with the exposure of magic having far-reaching consequences on relationships and has resulted in a number of police and FBI investigations throughout the series.This is my favorite show of all time.i loved it from my heart.i can't pick my favorite episode all were good. but i actually prefer these episodes where Prue was i loved her more than Paige.But Paige so damn cool too she was so perky and funny and sexier,but Prues acting was better And Of Course i loved Cole and baltazar too.Chris was interesting person. Miss this show so much.8 years a pure classic."
Charmed,Entertaining,"Three sisters share a house in San Francisco. Being descended from witches they have special powers. They use these powers to fight crime and evil.

Entertaining. A tad formulaic but the plots are reasonably interesting. The three main characters are given depth and this contributes positively to the sub-plots and the engagement level.

Engagement does diminish from Season 4 onwards though. Rose McGowan / Paige is irritating and is not in the same league as Shannen Doherty / Prue."
Charmed,"Girl power the power of three, as beautiful sexy witches battle evil makes for an entertaining series!","I still to this day am watching ""Charmed"" episodes as they even after all these years continue to air weekday mornings on ""TNT"", proving the popularity is ever lasting as the series became a pop culture magnet. Set in the city by the bay San Francisco you have three Halliwell sisters that being Piper(Holly Marie Combs) Phoebe(the sexy Alyssa Milano) and Prue(Shannen Doherty) who live together and they are special they have powers plus they are modern day witches! They have the special abilities to stop time, move objects, and see into the future. And along the way each episode and each season they battle the forces of supernatural evil from ghosts, demons, warlocks, and monsters. Many episodes are interesting and entertaining involving stories that involve the past of old enchanted fairy tales and it's always nice to see the girls cast up powerful spells and potions from their book of shadows as black magic and wicca is well on display in this series. Also at the end of the third season after Prue is no longer Paige(Rose McGowan) a half sister is introduced. These witches were sexy and modern day as several eye candy scenes were memorable as each had some intimate between the sheets scenes with their boyfriends, and to spice the series up I remember some episodes in which the girls wore sexy colored bras(I remember Alyssa sporting one very silk sexy multi colored bra in one episode late in one season of the series!) Really not everyone's cup of tea, yet if you like beautiful sexy women and a series that involves witches and good and evil with spells and magic then cast your eyes on this."
Charmed,Those Hallywell Sisters,"The occult got very hip on television with the arrival of Charmed. The show centered on three sisters played by Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and Shannen Doherty. As the show opened these three sisters who are their own BFFs discover they're the descendants of witches. But witches like Glinda the good witch. That doesn't mean that someone usually not of flesh and blood wouldn't want to drop a house on them as all kinds of evil things are tried against one or all of them every week.

What made this show work was that these girls were quite modern. the ultimate 90s women. Young girls identified with him and men certainly would have chosen any one of them for adventure and romance.

Unfortunately Shannen Doherty as she did on 90210 was quite the behavioral problem and she left the show. Another sister played by Rose McGowan was rather clumsily introduced as we could not alter what the writers called The Power of Three from the show. When the women put their powers together, just like the Power Rangers they were unstoppable.

Reruns of Charmed are still proving popular today. My two nieces loved the show when it was in first run and still like the reruns."

Charmed,when Shannen left the show went down,"when Shannen left the show the show went down to me .in the first seasons of charmed 1,2,3 it was three witches who had to fight evil and were kinda having love in their lives. when they killed off the star they messed the show up for life.rose McGowan is okay but not right in charmed. she was kinda funny but not.when Prue died Phoebe didn't really care but piper is the real one she cared.and what the hell is with these strange characters,Billie,Chris,Wyatt,Snake,Christie,they don't belong on the show.it went from Buffy and charmed to 7th heaven,Gilmore girls,and sex and the city.they are concerned about everything but witchcraft.at the end of the last episode their mom mentions Prue and Phoebe and piper just say so.its like they didn't even care that their sis was dead.they didn't have any picks of Prue.and their acting like Prue never existed"

Can't Help Falling in Love,Ridiculous plot to begin with but settled down nicely,Not as strong as KathNiel's previous collab eventhough they still showed nice chemistry. Mae Cruz-Alviar got ridiculous plot to begin with. A fun romcom to watch about 'wakeup call' moments before marriage that IMO many people can always relate to.
Can't Help Falling in Love,"Best companion to feel good, away from stress, to daydream of finding your own Gabgab or Dos","CHFIL is one of the few Pinoy movies I watched in cinema. Why? Because they usually have heart-wrenching scenes that I am not sure to manage to inside the cinema. And then why did I watch? because I can't wait to see what Kathryn Bernardo will be in this new offer. I am definitely recommending this one for those whose looking for a feel good stories but with depth. true, circumstances in the movie are far-fetched from reality, but not an impossibility. then there are the actors while watching, you just can't help to imagine them acting the same goofiness and just be silly in real life. you can't help to wished it to be the reality. you sharing time and space with them, witnessing their moments while they are falling in love with each other. you just can't help to wish to find the same kind of love, to find your own Gabgab, to find your own Dos."
Can't Help Falling in Love,Worth it,"Rom-com at its finest. I liked everything about the movie, the story-line, the twist, the acting, the cinematography, and etc. Also I liked how the actors leveled up. So yeah, This movie is really a must watch movie

Can't Help Falling in Love,Just your typical pinoy romantic film!,"I hope they get paired to someone else. It is very tiring seeing them all the time, making the same kind of film all the time.

Overrated and very generic."

Can't Help Falling in Love,okay movie. not the best from katniel though.,"The plot itself was crazy, but it was somewhat alright as the movie progressed, and the dialogue was okay. The acting was like alright, but the writing was really weird at certain moments. There's also way too many moments where i wonder if anything makes sense in this. 5/10. Okay. I wouldn't recommend this movie, however, if you like the ""katniel"" movies, i recommend watching the 'hows of us' or 'she's dating the gangster.'"
Can't Help Falling in Love,LOVEEEDDDDD It!,This movie was beautiful. It had great messages in it... I don't want to add spoilers... however I liked how respectful Dos was. I would recommended this movie to friends male or female.
Can't Help Falling in Love,One of the best rom-com Ive seen. Highly recommended,"The movie itself is fine because of the acting skills that pulled off the characters (Who were not developed by way), the immaculate chemistry between KathNiel, the display of tourism in the Philippines - specifically Cebu, and the amusing and healthy portrayal of Filipino families. The cinematography and visuals are undoubtedly great.

Though despite those, there are some problem areas regardless of the movie. The plot was too mediocre for a romantic-comedy film, the lines of the characters are average too. Very pick-up line and cheesy. I just didn't like the idea of love at first sight between the characters. It was very unrealistic because a 6-year-relationship shouldn't be taken over with just one night of being with a stranger. We didn't even get a flashback between Gab and Jason's love story."
Can't Help Falling in Love,Fun loving romantic movie,"Yes once again Daniel and Katherine have produced another fantastic romantic movie, I really love the chemistry between these two. The script is well done for a teenagey styled movie, its sweet and easy to watch, I've seen it a couple of times. A good watch for sure"
Can't Help Falling in Love,NO ONE CAN MAKE A ROM COM LIKE THE FILIPINOS. GENUINELY ONE OFTHE BEST I HAVE EVER WATCHED.,"The story, the comedy, the magic between the two main actors. PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you like rom coms you will love this one.

I am not from the Philippines, so I have no hidden agenda in giving this movie a 10 out of 10."
Best of Stand-up 2020,This is not it,"What happens when you take some comedians you know and like and you toss in other comedians that you don't like or don't enjoy the humor?

You end up with an hour of you questioning your choices.

This is the best of 2020?

Some jokes were straight up cringe."
Best of Stand-up 2020,"If this is the best stand up of 2020, how bad was the worst?!","Like they'd taken all the worst bits from some of the least funny comedians out there. Jack Whitehall's material in particular has been done 100 times before in a much funnier way and I spent the majority of the show wondering who in the hell laughed at any of these people the first time around?

2020 summed up in one show - desperate, sad and something I hope I never have to see again."
Best of Stand-up 2020,Sums up 2020,"This has got to be the worst bits they could find, I've seen most of these specials and somehow they managed to pick all the wrong parts making it a cringefest. Stopped watching 15 mins in, maybe it got better after.."
Best of Stand-up 2020,Poorly chosen skits,"A bad selection of segments of comedy special that shows a lot of misjudgement. Awful jokes that become worse decontextualized from their original routine, badly put together, and 90% of them in very poor taste, unfunny or plainly disgusting."
Best of Stand-up 2020,Not funny at all,Its so bad I couldn't finish it. The jokes are not even funny and some have a very bad taste.
Best of Stand-up 2020,Decent special,Great way to sample comedians you may not know. I dug it.
Best of Stand-up 2020,I can't believe how bad this is,This special includes so many comedians and bits which are not even remotely funny.
Best of Stand-up 2020,Some good some horrible.,"Every black comedian except for Kevin Hart.... ""White people white people white people...""."
Best of Stand-up 2020,They could of made an effort,"Perhaps commentary from other comedians about the specials would of been brilliant.

Felt like watching the longest trailer of my life, couldn't finish it. Tapped out after 30 minutes because I swear I thought I was watching for an hour by then and it was going to end soon, to my disappointment there was over 30 more minutes to go."
Best of Stand-up 2020,Wow! We're in trouble if this is the best!,"I don't know if one single comedian skit on here was funny. I don't know how these people in the audience are laughing cuz it's not funny at all. Didn't laugh once nor did I finish it. It may have been immediately better if they left off every single female comedian. Not one of them was even almost funny. This is just terrible and if it's the best offered from 2020 comedian wise, we are in a lot of trouble!

Pass on this garbage!"

Familiar Wife,an emotional and visual thrill ride,"This drama is simply excellent. I think Familiar Wife hits that sweet spot between fantastical romance and relatable reality. Despite the large role played by elements like 'destiny', Familiar Wife never fails to feel like an everyman's story, one that everyone can see themselves be a part of. This drama had so many applicable life lessons and such larger than life characters, it was a complete joy to watch them. Familiar Wife requires a slightly mature and forgiving audience, because these characters are flawed, not unlike real humans. They make mistakes, learn, and make more mistakes - and that's how life works."
Familiar Wife,"if we could all go back in time and solve our errors in love... comedy, drama and great acting.","My second K-drama with Seong Ju after 'kill me, heal me'. I really thought he was more for comedy, fun, but in this show he shows a deeper performance. This is a more mature romance, with ups and downs and the time travel part. I love the fantasy condiment in k-dramas, so I enjoyed this very much. I enjoyed watching this in 3-4 days, and the last 5 episodes all the afternoon in a free day. All the actors are great and when you finish watching, they became your friends too. You know how they will react, because of the true performances, script and direction. I have a pleasant smile after watching the last episode. I hope you too :) (Check my list 'Favourite Korean Dramas / Comedies')"
Familiar Wife,light hearted drama !,It's an amazing drama! This drama is perfect if you're looking for not so heavy storyline but still with good plots. You will like their chemistry and they're humorous too! A good drama to binge watch :)
Familiar Wife,"Great lead actors, good plot, good investment of your time","To all divorced men: if you could go back in time before you met your ex and avoid starting that il-fated relationship, would you do it? And what if you encountered said ex later in your new reality and found her to be vibrant, beautiful, vital, and exciting - the epitome of that woman you thought you were marrying earlier in your first life - what would you do? Would you leave her alone? Would you try to strike up a new relationship and avoid the problems you perhaps caused in the old reality? What if, by some rift in the space-time continuum, your paths crossed and she came on to you? Would you spurn her? Would you feel some sense of responsibility and watch out for her? Would you tell her you two are not meant to be?

These are the questions Cha Joo-Hyuk (Ji Seong) must wrestle with when he chooses to go back in time and erase the marriage he had with Seo Woo-Jin (Han Ji Min). The moral of the story is best summed up by Seo Woo Jin when she responds to Cha Joo-Hyuk's confession: ""There are no one-sided relationships."" Couples should give each other second chances and try to make the best of things.

Some reviewers complained that the plot got boring after episode 12, which admittedly is the emotional peak of the series. I don't think they quite got the gist of the last four episodes, wherein the two go back in time once more, only this time at Seo Woo-Jin's behest. Now Cha Joo-Hyuk is really in a bind. He knows that, without him, Seo Woo-Jin has a great life, even though she feels something is missing. Should he take the safe route and keep her away or let her back in, take the chance and try to do better?

I recently saw One Spring Night with Han Ji Min and really liked her craft. I searched for other dramas with her in it and found this one which is even better (heads up Netflix). IMHO she is a top shelf Korean female actor and she acquits herself nicely in this series.

I had never seen Ji Seong before but I am very impressed with his acting. I will keep an eye out for more of his work.

If you like K-dramas, Familiar Wife will be a good investment of your time."
Familiar Wife,Very Underrated,"What an underrated show! I stumbled across it by accident, and watched the first (and only?) season over the weekend.

Certain pieces were quirky, corny, slow, and forced, but were necessary for the conclusion. The sci-fi aspect to the show really hit home when they realized they had choices.

The casting was PERFECT -- and I cannot stress that enough.

This is a message to all divorced people, or anyone with questions about their choices. You don't need to disrupt your entire timeline to make better choices concerning your attitude and relationship RIGHT NOW.

I LOVED THIS SHOW. Please don't create a sequel. It is perfect as-is."
Familiar Wife,I love Discovery of Love much more,"Good husband makes a nicer wife. This drama let husbands make reflection on their attitude of treating of their wives and family. Lacking of care and concern ruins the family. Jusung is such a husband. However he is given a second life to experience a marriage with another wife, a dream girl he is always thinking of, but then find out that the original wife is actually his best choice. The story is itself quite meaningful.

This drama makes me think of Discovery of love, which is another relationship drama to let men reflect how a man should care for his girlfriend. That is a great drama. Out of more than 50 kdrama i have watched, it is my favourite and i will give a full score of 10.

I watched Discovery of love long time ago. The two dramas have a similar theme and similar message to bring out. But to me, i find Discovery of love excel Familiar wife.

I think the problem lies in the 2nd female lead of Familiar wife. In language of my place, her character is only one dimensional, that is, she is made the villian of the drama and is bad without a reason. A spoiled wealthy girl who does not care about her motherinlaw and develops an extramarital relationship with a guy younger than her. In the love square, clearly she is made the culprit and the one to be blamed for breaking of relationship. She is kind of like the witch in Snow White, shouldering all the blame. She is a simple solution for the writer to bring out the divorce.

Besides, the writer rely on a time travel to the past to let jisung come to understand what is wrong with him. Time travel is a convenient means to bring out regret of jisung

In Discovery of love, there exists also a love square. But no single side is totally wrong. In fact, they are all decent persons. The 2nd male lead meets his child sweet heart again and therefore shaking his relationship with the lead actress. On the other hand, the male lead come to work with the female lead. He begins to treasure his past love with the female lead out of jealousy. He has a deeper understanding of her through constant contact and finally revive their love. The storyline is much more intricate and resemble the complexity of the true world. As some commentary say, it is a realistic drama, with a plot not easy to write.

In the coming epd jisung will tell the truth to female lead about their marriage in his first life. Hope that the climax is yet to come."
Familiar Wife,Stellar ensemble acting and lead actors are superb in unique and thoughtful Kdrama on marriage,Comentario no disponible
Familiar Wife,"Worth the time, but not Ji Sung's best","Though similar at first to ""Go Back Couple"", that is only superficially: this series is more mature, poignant, sad, and joyous. As usual, Ji Sung takes a narrative and gives both humor and grace that keeps the viewer focused far more intimately than most actors can achieve. His beauty and depth are mesmerizing. And when you hit ep. 8, you know this is special. However, that is the height of the series, and the rest is mostly standard: good not great, especially for Ji Sung."
Familiar Wife,Criminally Underrated,"I am an avid kdrama watcher and I will regard this drama as my favorite of all time. I am sincerely wondering why it doesn't have a higher rating. To begin with, the chemistry between all the cast is amazing, each and every side character as well. The main leads are tremendous actors and I regard Han Ji-Min as my favorite actress because of this drama as well as her others. This drama truly lets her shine and we get to see so many of her talents in acting. Secondly, the plot is superb. It is both a story easily heard of but also uniquely performed. I really appreciated how the plot was not only for Ju Hyeok to realize what was really wrong in his marriage, but for Wu-Jin as well. It is absolutely realistic and tremendously easy to fall in love with. Lastly, I read many reviews stating that the last few episodes were dull and I'll disagree by saying those were my favorites! We really got to see the sweet behavior between the main couple as what should have happened in a marriage that is healthy and communicative. Over all, it is hard not to fall in love with all the characters in this show. I must say I will honestly miss watching it. I 10/10 recommend it to everyone, even those who barely watch Korean shows."
Familiar Wife,Too Many Head Scratching Moments,Comentario no disponible
Familiar Wife,Unforgettable and relatable,"This KDrama made me happy, laugh, sad, and mostly tears of joy. If you are married with kids the this Kdrama will hit you harder, do yourself a favor and watch it, because you will learn alot how to have a perfect relationship with your partner."
Familiar Wife,Started strong then it kinda drags,"I like the premise and the stories. The characters are all good and engaging. I like the main couple. Ji hyuk is very handsome and wu jin is also amazing, playing lots of part - the crazy wife, the level headed worker, and a high schooler.

They do look too old to be a high schooler and a university student.

The blatant commercial also makes me laugh and kinda off putting.

But overall it is a good romance story. Maybe 16 episodes are too long but that's what the fast forward button is for."
Familiar Wife,Good Enough,"This drama reminds me of two others : Manhole and Go back couple. However, even though those two dramas had a solid plot and purpose of why they were made, this drama failed to deliver. I'm not concerned on it not being original. If the plot is good, why not watch it again with other characters? The main minus, however, that I've found is that the drama pretty much finished in episode 12. The rest of episodes were some unreasonable and meaningless plot twists, happy ever afters and just cute family life. It felt like the writers didn't know what to do with their story and just rushed to add something to fill the hours that were remaining. Part from that major setback, the performances by the cast were great by all the actors and actresses and they pulled it off nicely. Also, the drama up to the 12th episode, was very good and interesting."
Familiar Wife,So unexpectedly good ITS A MUCH WATCH,I didn't know what to expect from the title of the show but from the 2nd/3rd it's soooo amazing. I don't think I've ever felt the pain of the characters in a show quite like this before. It's incredibly underrated. And the actors are so good at what they did. The whole concept is so cool. And the soundtrack... oh boy even listening to it now brings tears to my eyes cause it remind me of them and their hurt and their love. MUST WATCH
Familiar Wife,So underrated,No idea why it got all the negativity but for me it was deep and sad and funny. You knew the places where the male lead is being an ass but you are still rooting for him because the actor is very convincing. The main couple's chemistry is beyond amazing. The second lead is cute too. What more do you want??!! The events that were happening kept me interested up until the end. But it would have been so much better if the male lead could go back to the previous version of his wife and make things better for themselves and clean the mess they created. Anyways I can't stress enough on the acting ability of ji sung...no other actor could have pulled this off.
Familiar Wife,Could do with a better ending,"Loved this drama, but found that the ending is quite draggy and it could do more with more twist.. Somehow feel something is missing towards the end.."

Ozark,Such a great show,"I know it hasn't been long since it ended but I already miss Ozark. This show absolutely, without a doubt, lives up to all the hype it gets. It's a gripping thriller where the tension continues to build throughout each episode and each season and then pays off in a huge way. It really is a must watch show. People like to compare it to Breaking Bad and while I don't agree with that comparison because BB is the better show, Ozark is still terrific and worth every second. The one thing I can't stand about this show is Laura Linney's character (Wendy). While I don't mind Linney as an actress, because she's a pretty good one, in this she plays an annoying know it all who doesn't appreciate anything. Again, it's not her fault, it's just the way her character was written and as annoying as she was it still doesn't take away from the fact that this is such a great show."
Ozark,Great show...disappointing ending,"The best way to describe Ozark is that it's just a flat out awesome show and a must watch! I'm so glad that I did finally start watching it because it's become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Everything about this show is excellent...the acting, writing, directing, production, cinematography, etc. Are all as good as it gets. The acting is so good that you really come to care for these characters and what happens to them even though they're not exactly the best human beings possible. I can not overstate just how good this show really is. It's one of the rare shows where every season is just as good as the others. The only negative would have to be the ending. While not the worst ending ever it's also not very good. It doesn't mean the show wasn't worth watching because you'll have fun for the majority of it but a little disappointed in the ending."
Ozark,Ozark: A Riveting Thriller That Keeps You Hooked,"In the gritty world of crime dramas, ""Ozark"" shines as a beacon of excellence, delivering a masterclass in tension, storytelling, and character development. With its dark and brooding atmosphere, impeccable performances, and intricate plot twists, this series is a rollercoaster ride that you won't want to end.

Jason Bateman's portrayal of Marty Byrde, a financial planner turned money launderer, is nothing short of extraordinary. His ability to seamlessly switch between charm and menace is a testament to his acting prowess. Paired with Laura Linney's captivating performance as Wendy Byrde, the power couple at the center of the chaos, the chemistry between the two leads elevates the show to new heights.

What sets ""Ozark"" apart is its unflinching look at the consequences of criminality and the lengths people will go to protect themselves and their families. The moral dilemmas faced by the characters are palpable, and the stakes are always high, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Julia Garner as the cunning Ruth Langmore and Tom Pelphrey as the troubled Ben Davis. Each character is fleshed out with depth and nuance, making the tangled web of alliances and betrayals all the more compelling.

With its intricate storytelling, impeccable direction, and haunting score, ""Ozark"" is a true gem in the world of television. It's a show that demands your attention and rewards it with richly layered narratives and heart-pounding suspense.

In conclusion, ""Ozark"" is a must-watch for any fan of gripping drama and intricate character studies. With a rating of 9/10, this series cements its place as one of the finest shows on television today."
Ozark,What I don't get about Ozark,Comentario no disponible
Ozark,Nerve wrecking thriller worth the watch,This series is a home run for Netflix. Its a gripping series with superb casting for every character. It is an edge of your seat thriller that grips the audience from the very start. Throughout each episode you are helplessly wondering how Jason Bateman's character will pull through. The writers of the show are spot on with every twist. I highly recommend giving this series a chance and i can't wait for season 2 to come out. From the first episode to the last it is a brilliant masterpiece that deserves better reviews than other people have given. %100 one of the best new series of the year.
Ozark,SERIES 3 IS A WINNER,Comentario no disponible
Ozark,"Season 1-3 : Absoluty amazing, Season 4 : A disaster","Ozark was such an amazing show during his 3 first seasons, a masterpiece of drama combining poignant intrigue, mastered production, meticulous writing touched by a dose of skillfully distilled black humor. It's was one of my favorites shows and one of the few that I rated 10 but now i just give it a 9 because the season finale has completely ruined my love for this show because this season 4 was so bad oh my god...

Season 4 is lack of action, tension or typical Ozark's plot twist/violence. The pace is extremely slow and storyline does not conclude properly. Everything goes so fast around the last 30 minutes, and so many questions to answer. It's predictable, and weak compared to the quality of the 3 first seasons, did they switch of writers or what ?

There was characters coming in and out and one minute they all hate each other and then don't. It was just inconsistent and felt like they weren't sure how to finish everything. A lot of plots ultimately lead to nothing more than a pointless storyline.

The ending is a joke, it doesn't feel like an ending. Just a regression of most of the characters and the final scene is nonsense in every conceivable way. Ozark ending fails while Sopranos ending doesn't. The writers did not spend any effort on the final and find how to resolve the built-up tension through four seasons! It felt like a last-minute homework of a terrible student. What a waste, this season finale just ruins the show !"

Ozark,I don't understand the high rating. Slightly overrated.,"The series is a solid 7 when it peaks and 6 most of the time. I have no clue how this series is rated this high. I just slogged through season 3 and 4 just because i already invested my time watching the first two seasons. Everyone starts acting like a moron from season 3. They create problems which could be so easily avoided. The show wants you to be an idiot so that you can ignore these stupid things and enjoy it. MEDIOCRE is the word. Not bad but not good either. Just overrated. That said, Julia Garner does an amazing job as Ruth, almost carries the show. Laura is a fantastic actress too."
Ozark,Very unique. Terrific Actors,"I never would have watched this if not for the quarantine. It wasn't promoted well. I LOVED IT! Great script, tons of action and characters that you love to hate and hate to love."

Ozark,8/10 only because of disappointing finale,Comentario no disponible
Ozark,Pretty dark,"I get how good the show is, intense and dark showing the nature of what will do to survive. I was rooting for the family in season one but after a while, seeing how disconnected and unemotional everyone was, I had no one to root for.

I guess I like to see something of myself in the main characters that I can relate to, so I lost interest. I know it's great acting and yes feels very real, I felt like I was trainwrecks waiting to happen. I think a lot of people are tuning in to see someone's whose life is worse so they can feel better, too deep?

Anyways, hats off to Jason Bateman for making a gripping show, you keep seeing the darker side of humanity and wondering ""is this really how bad it is?"""
Ozark,"Once you're there, you'll never come back","Definitely, one of best Tv shows about mafia on NETFLIX. Events unfold slowly, but with enormous progress and cruelty. Each character plays their role on final. The most important thing in Ozark its relationships between family, when children grow up and see what their parents do. As a result, the children's consciousness breaks down and they will begin to imitate their parents.

Jason Bateman, opened up in a new, non-comedy way and amazed. The character of Marty Byrde himself was pragmatic and sometimes pathetic. Unlike his wife, who became very cruel and insane."
Ozark,Intense from the very beginning with higher stakes each episode,"Ozark sets itself in a high stakes environment and carries that high intensity throughout the series . The episodes and story are easy to watch and don't drag anything too much . As someone who gets bored very quickly , it kept me on my seat from the beginning .

Jason Bateman gives an exceptional performance . Probably the most likable anti-hero ever . Same goes for all the other characters in the Byrde family .

However in spite of all of this , the ending left me utterly confused and disappointed and looking for answers . I felt that the writers had created something that they could not handle and thus fumbled the ending with so many open threads .

I highly recommend it regardless of that . You will enjoy . Go in with an open mind . Also stay off reddit and the wiki to avoid spoilers."
Ozark,Shot in the dark,"It was a very riveting series with lots of twists and turns throughout. The characters were very real people, very believable situation in these times with the cartels in this world. It is not a show in my opinion for a young audience even though it's not hard to believe this is how things are for real people in the underworld of drug cartels and weapons etc. My only complaint is that the show was very hard to view, it is very dark. A lot of the show it was like watching a black screen. It was frustrating wondering what was taking place for a lot of it. All in all great acting and a good story line."

Ozark,Season 3 Superb,Season 3 is absolutely brilliant. The acting and script are joy to behold. Keep up the great work and can't wait for season 4.
Ozark,And it ends like that?!,"I enjoyed the entire journey. I watched so many things go wrong and so many things go right. And THAT'S how you end the season finale of all seasons?! I'm so disappointed.

Still give it a good rating though cause it's about the journey not the destination. But the destination was incredibly disappointing. I will just go lie down and stare at the ceiling in a state of depression now."
Ozark,"A tense,tight and consistently entertaining thriller",Ozark is pretty much what you'd expect it to be. Its a pretty tense what-is-he-going-to-do-now type of storytelling that makes it easy to binge-watch.It also holds your attention as Jason Bateman plays a similar kind of character as the likable anti-hero keeps falling in trouble.Similar to breaking bad but also quite different.
The Lighthouse of the Orcas,,
Om Shanti Om,Entertainment at its best,"Bring out the popcorn, grab a cola and get ready for 2 and a half hours of laughs, songs, color, emotions, and spoofs. If you're a fan of the Indian film industry and have kept up with the news, Om Shanti Om is for you. If you love entertainment to the max, OSO is definitely for you! Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om spares nobody, not even its makers when it comes to poking fun. OSO is a film about films, it's a film in a film and above all, it's made to celebrate the biggest film producing industry - The Indian Film Industry.

Om Prakash is a junior artist who thrives to become a lead hero one day. He is a horrible actor and has a mother who hams more than him. Om has another dream: To win over a star, Shanti-Priya. One circumstance leads to another which leads to Om being a witness to the death of Shanti by producer Mukesh Mehra. Om also gets killed in the incident. That same night, Om is reborn as Om Kapoor. Will Om realize his past-life? Will he avenge Shanti's death? As the tagline suggests: For some dreams, one life-time is not enough.

OSO has a done-to-death story. But that's not the point. The film is a parody of films and the ones working in it. Notice the spoofs on the yesteryear stars such as Manoj Kumar. A controversial scene but one can't deny it's hilarious. Not to forget spoofs on Govinda, Keshtu Mukherjee, and Suraj Bharjateeyaa. Of course the most memorable comic scene has to be SRK pretending to be a south Indian actor. ""Mind It"" OSO's first half is gripping and keeps the viewer alert. The drama folds the right way. The second half loses steam at times. It's not bad, but unlike Farah's first film where the second half competed well with the first, it stars to slow down a bit. It picks back up, fortunately.

The spoofs aren't less hilarious in the second half. The film pokes fun of a lot of celebs and Indian film industry issues. To start, SRK being late is a spoof on himself being late to sets in real life. Not to forget the whole dard-e-disco song is a spoof on item numbers. The high point of the second half has to be the award ceremony. The spoof on Abhishek Bachchan is subtle yet funny. SRK doing the same roles and being nominated is remarkably funny. Not to forget Akshay KUmar's outburst at the awards is aplaudworthy and rib-tickling. Subash Ghai-Rishi Kapoor spoof is funny too.

Flaws? As mentioned, the second half falters in some parts. Also, SRK remembering his past so quickly seems rushed and unconvincing.

The climax, however, is a pleasant surprise.

Special Mention - The Deewangee song is a treat to the eyes. 31 stars in one song is no joke and they all look nothing short of spectacular. Special mention to the ones that caught my eye with their appearance. Dharmendra, Jatendra, Kajol, Salman, Saif, Sanju, Rekha etc all do well alongside Shah Rukh Khan.

Farah Khan and her team of writers have put some genius into parts of the movie. The writing is witty, smart, and quite innovative. Dilague is first rate.

Vishal-Shekar's music is amazing. With a variety of songs in one film, they do a wonderful job.

Farah's direction is first rate. She handles all the moments with ease. It's not a better film than Main Hoon Na, but still a good job.

In 2007, 3 months before OSO released; SRK unleashed the actor in him and kept the star away in a movie called Chak De India. In OSO, it's the opposite. OSO is a film where SRK can chill and not worry about the criticism. His performance is explosive and energetic. In this, it's SRK the superstar unleashed. And kudos to him for also poking fun at himself despite being the producer of this one.

Deepika makes a grand debut and I'm sure she couldn't have asked for anything else. She looks gorgeous and makes a good debut. Arjun Rampal is spectacular as the villain here. Brilliant.

The supporting cast does well too which includes the lovable Shreyas Talpade, the scene-stealing Kirron Kher and Javed Sheikh.

Overall, A grand film which has one objective - Entertainment!"
Om Shanti Om,So much fun,"I'm an American, and have not seen very many Bollywood films -- Three Idiots, Saariwaya, and one or two others in passing -- but I know a spoof when I see it. This movie was a romp -- overdone theatrics, over-the-top musical numbers, and lots of wink-wink-nudge-nudge allusions. Actually, I probably missed most of those -- but I got enough of them to keep smiling all the way through. Nicely plotted, plenty of really good catch-lines, and warm-hearted at the core. I especially like the end credits, where crew members and the usually faceless support people did a kind of 'red carpet' appearance, to the applause and cheers of the mob. Great bit at the very end, where the director/writer got out of the tuk-tuk for her moment, and everybody was .... well, no spoilers here. Just watch the film. Well worth your time."
Om Shanti Om,The grandest masala show. The result: LOL!,"Reincanation, Hindi cinema, love, betrayal are some of the themes Farah Khan's delightful and crazy comedy Om Shanti Om deals with. But frankly, it never really matters. This film is simply one of the most entertaining films made in recent times. A spoof of Hindi cinema of past and recent times, the film both pokes fun at it and celebrates its unique, inimitable style. As the story progresses the movie becomes even more alluring. It is at times a drama, at times a thriller, but generally it is just a musical comedy which is not to be taken seriously.

Technically the film is very impressive. Farah Khan's direction is very good. The film is extremely colourful, with great costumes and fantastic, glossy sets. The 1970s settings are particularly authentic and visibly well-invested. One more aspect which helps to recreate the magic and the atmosphere of the 1970s is the wonderful soundtrack. ""Dhoom Taana"" for instance seems to have been rightly taken from a film of those times.

The film contains numerous sequences which will have you floored. The Filmfare Award ceremony is one of the funniest sequences in the film. The red carpet scene with celebrities predicting the winners was very funny. The next scene which includes the ceremony and the Best Actor nominations clip was absolutely hilarious. I could not stop laughing as every nominee was unfolded, and Abhishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar's reactions when they lost were awesome.

The following sequence was the after-party which was another memorable scene. The famous ""Deewangee Deewangee"" song which has some of the best-known actors in India dancing to its tunes, from Dharmendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Rekha and Shabana Azmi to Salman, Saif, Juhi, Urmila, Tabu, Kajol, Rani and Preity, was very exciting and a pleasure to watch. It was truly a moment of unity and celebration for Hindi cinema.

As far as acting goes, Om Shanti Om is a winner. Every actor understands the film's mood and acts accordingly. Shahrukh Khan is great as the Oms. He's simple as the first Om, cool as the second Om, and overall is as witty and funny as always. Deepika Padukone makes a confident debut. She is very beautiful and likable. Kirron Kher shines in another comic role as the loud mom. Shreyas Talpade delivers a noteworthy performance as Om's best friend and holds his own despite a smaller role. Arjun Rampal plays the typical villain with style.

Well, to sum it up, Om Shanti Om is an extremely enjoyable flick which should provide a great watch for the entire family. Like Farah Khan's previous offering with Shahrukh Khan, Main Hoon Na, this film has a genuine sense of fun. It is the quintessence of Bollywood's uniqueness which makes us realise why and how much we love this film industry. Remember not to expect anything serious or life-turning, and you will not be disappointed."
Om Shanti Om,Just Fantastic!!!,"If you sit to watch a typical Bollywood Commercial masala movie, Leave your brains behind. Om Shanti Om is one such film that entertains you in every aspect.

Om Shanti Om is the story of the Indian Film World. It is the story of a Junior Artist (Extra) Om Prakash Makhija (Shah Rukh Khan) who dreams to become a superstar one day. He is madly in love with Shanti Priya (Deepika Podukone) who is a super star and she is in love with a film producer Mukesh Ahuja (Arjun Rampal). Mukesh after learning this fact that Shanti is pregnant with his child and his most ambitious project will come to hold if he marries her, He kills her. This whole event is witnessed by Shanti's good friend and her secret lover Om. Even Om dies in that tragic accident while trying to save Shanti. Mukesh runs to Hollywood and get's married there a multi-millionaire's daughter.

But destiny has a total different story to tell Om is reborn again after 30 years as a Super Star Om Kapoor (Shah Rukh Khan) and the destiny makes om meets Sandy (Deepika Podukone) who is a look alike of Shanti Priya. Om and Sandy make a plan to trap Mukesh who comes back to India after 30 years to make a film with Om. The evil get's punished and the truth wins forms the rest of the film.

Technically the film is just brilliant. It shows on the screen the amount of money that has been spent into the making. The sets are glossy and breath taking. The camera work is just superb. The editing is fantastic and crispy. Musically a very decent and a good effort. Especially the song where all the 31 stars perform is a treat to watch for. The story and direction by Farah Khan is very good.

Performance wise the film belongs to King Khan Shah Rukh Khan all the way. New girl Deepika Podukone is the next superstar. It did not seem at all that she is a new actress and this is her First Film. Arjun Rampal was awesome in the negative role. Kirron Kher was really good once again. Shreyas Talpade was again very good. He gets an equal footage with Shah Rukh to perform.

For those who go for Artistic Cinema, This film is strictly not for them. But those who need Full Time Pass, Om Shanti Om is the real good choice. Here the Film Maker is trying to fool you, But in return they are offering you a Glossy Dream of 2 hours. So if you are looking for a Roller Coaster ride of Entertainment, Go for Om Shanti Om!"
Om Shanti Om,Picture abhi baaki hai mere dost,"probably one of the most hilarious movies and I guess the best spoof ever made in Bollywood....Farah is not scared of showing Manoj Kumar, Dev Anand and Sooraj Bharjatya in bad light....this is what the new age bollywood movies should be...bollywood is slowly adapting Hollywood style of spoofing characters and movies (check scary movie series or epic movie)...but this movie is far better than the western counterpart....

coming to performances SRK has delivered another master performance... though not in the likes of Swades, Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa and Chak de, it still would rank amongst his better performances...Deepika is camera friendly and looks sexy...she has also acted well considering that this is her first Hindi film..she is pretty confident in front of the camera..Kiron kher is excellent as over the top filmy mother...Shreyas is a revelation and is improving a lot...Arjun too has come up with a good performance...the movie could have been better in terms of direction/editing (second half) but the performances and spoofs make up for it..."
Om Shanti Om,"A delight for those familiar with Bollywood...otherwise, probably not your best film to watch.","""Om Shanti Om"" is an excellent film. However, it's also one that your enjoyment of it may depend on how familiar you are with Bollywood movies. If you haven't seen any or perhaps only one or two, it might be far less interesting for the intermediate and advanced fans of Indian cinema. As for me, I am definitely an intermediate and would actually loved to have had a big-time Indian movie fan watch it with me, as I only recognized some of the huge Indian movie stars that appeared in the film in the star-studded middle.

The film begins in the 1970s. Om (Shah Rukh Khan) is a struggling actor--a bit player. He's smitten with a leading lady but she seems way out of his reach. Later, however, there is a fire on set and he saves her life--and definitely gets her attention. But, fires seem to come in twos in this film and a bit later, her evil secret husband murders her--and Om is killed as well!

At this point, something VERY Indian occurs. Just as Om dies in the hospital, in an adjoining room, a baby is born--and the baby turns out to be the reincarnation of Om. The baby's name...Om!! This Om grows up to become a HUGE Indian mega-star and his life is good.

Following a portion of the film at an Indian movie award ceremony (by far the best part of the film--and hilarious as well), Om starts to have memories of his previous incarnation. He slowly comes to realize what happened to Om #1 and decides to concoct a complicated plan to trap the murderer by re-staging the murder that happened 30 years ago! However, the plan ends up going askew...just how, you'll have to see for yourself.

The film is a delight but a strange one. It's like there are three different movies all spliced together. The first and third portions are very serious and the musical numbers are wonderful. As for the second, it is completely different in tone. Om #2 is a mega-star-- and a hilariously self-absorbed one. And, to make it much funnier, lots of very famous Indian mega-stars appear as themselves...sort of. You just have to see this to know what I am talking about but it is something Indian film fans will love--as if they have a back stage pass to REALLY meet the stars as they supposedly really are! Wonderful--and by far the best part of the film.

Overall, despite having a few clichés (ones you EXPECT in Bollywood films---such as an ever-present fan to make the stars' hair blow in the wind), the film is one of the most enjoyable and fun Indian pictures you can find. Well worth seeing for fans of the genre.

By the way, after the picture ends, do NOT turn off the movie. In a really neat twist, not only the stars walk past the camera but just about EVERYONE involved with the film gets their moment on the runway--even the grips and choreographers!"
Om Shanti Om,Get Some Popcorn & Prepare for Some Spicy Entertainment,"'Might wanna include some fresh drinks with that. That's what 'Om Shanti Om' provides in a huge dose. No not the fresh drinks, but the entertainment. I had seen Farah Khan's last flick 'Main Hoon Na' and didn't like it but 'Om Shanti Om' for me was very enjoyable. I liked it's colourfulness and its not taking itself seriously. In short, it's a spoof of Bollywood.

The main plot itself is cleverly inspired by 'Madhumati' and 'Karz' and further you'll see situations that mock Hindi films of the 70s and Hindi films of today. There are numerous famous actors who make fun of themselves. The Filmfare sequence with Shahrukh Khan, Akshay Kumar, The Bachchans, Shabana Azmi were all lol hilarious. There are several such moments which make you feel as if you're under the influence of Novocain (I mean that in a good way).

The songs are of the hummable and foot-tapping kind, most of them spectacularly picturized. I liked how the 'Deewangee' song was filmed as it included most of my favorite actresses like Shabana Azmi, Juhi Chawla, Urmila Matondkar, Tabu, Kajol, Shilpa Shetty, Rani Mukherji etc. Tabu certainly looked the best of the lot. She was drop-dead hot. Of course there was also the funny sequence where Shahrukh danced with Mithun Chokroborty. However, the song may have been a little too long and perhaps Farah could have cropped it out a little by not including some bad actors. Oh well, she probably didn't want to be rude.

Shahrukh Khan is very good as the Oms. One might argue that he overacted in the second half but, in my opinion, he was merely spoofing himself and other Bollywood actors. Kirron Kher too is a treat to watch and she provides some of the LOL moments e.g. when she's spoofing the 70s Bollywood mom or as the 'crazy witch' who saw a ghost. Shreyas Talpade, though cast in a supporting role, holds his own and does nothing short of a great job. Arjun Rampal impresses as the evil villain. I was wondering what happened to this actor after delivering an amazing performance in 'Moksha' and now it's good to see that he's back in form. 'Hope he doesn't get typecast as he plays the bad guy very well. Deepika Padukone is a decent débutante. I liked her as Shantipriya (she looks great in the traditional Indian outfits than the Western stuff) but as Sandy she didn't impress me much (she didn't have much to do anyway).

Farah Khan and Shahrukh Khan probably had a lot of fun in the making and they've certainly made something for all of us to enjoy. This is one of the better 'masala' films to emerge from Hindi Cinema in recent times. As long as you're not expecting any serious film that will alter your life and go see it with the intention to have fun, you won't be disappointed."
Om Shanti Om,All because of SRK,Comentario no disponible
Om Shanti Om,Love in dreams,"'Om Shanti Om' is, simply, one of the best films ever made.

'Singing in the Rain' is the closest reference cinematically and thematically, both films are about the inside of the movie business Hollywood and Bollywood respectively. Baz Lurhman was going for the same kind of thing with 'Moulin Rouge' and - despite hyper-active trickery and bombast - managed to express romance, art and music pretty well, though not as well as is done here.

'Om Shanti Om' manages to combine drama, high emotion, nostalgia, fantasy, romance and self-referential humor to perfection.

Simply told, this is a film about fans. What it is to love an idol on the big screen and the unbreakable fantasy of stepping up onto the big screen. This is also a metaphor for love and the film is also, suitably, wildly romantic.

Anyone who truly loves cinema intelligently will adore this film. Shah Rukh Khan is on his own today, with perhaps Denzel Washington, as a leading man with infinite appeal and effortless charm, intelligence, humor and presence; a movie star at home with the all-time greats.

Deepika Padukone is both a stunning beauty and a complete actress, incredibly, managing to match her brilliant co-star in comedic and dramatic range.

Farah Khan is a director of extraordinary technical and artistic skill and the vision she exerts in Om Shanti Om is breath-taking.

Leave your preconceptions about Bollywood aside and embrace a true classic."
Om Shanti Om,Could of been much better,"I think the film is OK, as said had the potential to be 10 stars.

There is good acting from most of the cast, but the story did drag on a little...the first half of the film was excellent, good performances, every second of the first half was good, no scene was wasted it was full of emotion, lots of laughter, and overall seeming to be a very enjoyable movie! I recommend people to watch this film, mainly because its a shahrukh film, the only downside is the second half, the story is not good, i feel u'll understand watching the film. The story could of had a better ending, however i feel the entertainment value is very high, drawn to the fact that there is almost every star in bollywood in the film. good film 7/10"
Om Shanti Om,save your money and watch on pirated DVD,"This film encapsulates all that is wrong with the modern India: A tendency to get satisfied with fluff and superficiality. Farah Khan started with a grand vision of recreating a spoof on Bollywood itself. While the idea is laudable, the intellectual machinery behind the film was not enough to pull it off. Even if you try to shut your brain off and enjoy the movie, the rudimentary consciousness of the brain stem screams at the banalities. Shahrukh was at his overacting best, Deepika had no clue and Arjun Rampal was deader than a dead pan. Shreyas and Kiron Kher are impressive. The only saving grace of the movie is Vishal-Shekhar's melodious score. Save your money watch the 2 bucks DVD from neighborhood Indian grocer."
Om Shanti Om,SRK is still king!,"Shah Rukh has a great track recording of releasing movies around Diwali and in the past they have all been hits, and judging by his latest home production, this one is going to do big business as well.

A couple of points to come out of this movie. First is the transformation in Shah Rukh's body. The guy seems to have worked real hard and the results are awesome. Second is the new heroine Deepika Padukone. She holds her ground well and delivers a top performance.

Arjun Rampal also puts in a good showing as a bad guy.

And the songs are awesome too. Watch for the number where everyone (except the Bachchan's) make an appearance.

You will love this one."
Om Shanti Om,A fun movie. Deepika Padukone is enthralling.,"This review is coming more than a month from the release of this movie. But, how does it matter when Deepika Padukone is still fresh in memory with her Ajab si adaayen. Honestly, I went to the movie to watch her. Long ago, I had predicted that this babe would make a big entry into films. Well, a debut with SRK! How bigger can it get?

This Deepawali had two major releases, King Khan and Farah Khan’s OSO and Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Saawariya. Most newspapers drew comparisons between these movies, some on story, on the débutante lead actresses, track record of directors, songs, so on and so forth coupled with aggressive marketing campaigns.

OSO starts with the story of a junior artiste Om Makhija in the 70s deeply in love with screen sensation Shantipriya. Both become friends after Om saves Shanti from a fire accident on the sets. Both die in exceptional circumstances and Om is reborn again, this time as superstar Om Kapoor 30 years later. Om realizes his past and sets out for villain Mukesh Mehra in his quest to uncover the secret of his past lover’s demise.

Till the interval, Farah Khan did a great job on recreating 70s cinema. Two comic sequences, one on Manoj Kumar and the other on a mock Tamil film shoot are hilarious. While being a parody on the movie industry of those days, in many ways, OSO pays tribute to many cinematic moments, such as those of rebirth with the Om sign, group dance sequences, bell bottom pants, etc. The best stuff stops here.

The second segment dwells too much on SRK’s stardom and the story somehow loses focus. Deepika’s role is too limited. But here, villain Arjun Rampal as steals the show. The best of the comic sequences is the Award ceremony with many star cameos. The clips of nominees that is shown there is worth the watch. The end too is very filmy. End credits follow Farash’s style in her first films to show her entire crew. That was sweet.

Non-SRK fans may not really like any praise that I say here. But, one must admit that this great guy has amazing star power, all acquired on his own! There is no dull moment in OSO. Ah, and what do I say of Deepika, she’s just awesome! Arjun Rampal, Shreyas Talpade and Kirron Kher have done great. The music too is captivating. If you haven’t seen this movie, I would say it is worth it for its entertainment value."

Om Shanti Om,"Pure masti, at it's maximum level! *Minor Spoilers*","When I first heard of Farah Khan and Shah Rukh teaming up to make their project called Om Shanti Om, based on reincarnation, I was surprised and raised my eyebrows at their choice of storyline. I decided not to even think about seeing the movie until I had read many reviews and heard about the fate of the film. Now, after seeing it, I cannot believe I doubted Shah Rukh Khan's talent and Farah's masala for even a second!

Om Shanti Om is pure brilliance. Just after about 10 minutes into the film and I was hooked. Everything is perfected, there isn't much to criticize at all.

The performances - Shah Rukh Khan once again delivers entertainment at it's absolute max. Looking hotter than ever, now with incredibly sexy six-pack abs, SRK shows off his skill in style. The intensity and emotion of Om is portrayed very well. Arjun Rampal is fantastic, I have never seen him do a role like this before. I had never imagined he could PULL OFF something like this. Yet, there are times when he even overshadows Shah Rukh, he was great as the villain Mukesh. Deepika Padukone shines and actually does a decent performance, and has some acting ability underneath her beautiful supermodel looks. Despite the slight criticism saying she cannot pull off the 70s outfits, I thought she looked wonderful and did her role with dignity. Shreyas Talpade does another cute but powerful performance after Iqbal, and Kirron Kher tugs at your heart with her famous motherly role. She adds a small zing to Om Shanti Om that only she could have done. Bindu and Javed Sheikh makes small appearances.

Om Shanti Om provides outrageous and hilarious comedy, complete and over-the-top melodrama, romance, action, and everything in between. It is a true masala film. Farah Khan lived up to the standard she left with Main Hoon Na.

The music is also something I judged before seeing the film. I reckoned the music was mediocre, but now I understand that the music has kept the film going! Dard-e-Disco is the chart topping item and dance number, with Deewangi Deewangi as the crowd teaser, Ajab Si and Agar Main Kahoon are the romantic songs, and Jag Soona Soona as a ghazal-ish track. I liked Dhoom Taana a lot also, but my favourite will always be Dard-e-Disco...SRK and his gorgeous abs... :)

Farah Khan has once again provided pure entertainment. One thing I really love about her movies is that they mock EVERYTHING. And she mocks it all with such style, that you cannot help loving it. She made fun of it all. And I mean it ALL. The Filmfare awards were one of the funniest things I have ever seen, and ditto for Shah Rukh's attempt to show off to Deepika in the first half (""Naughty pussy, naughty pussy""!!). I also loved the way Farah Khan thanks all the people working in her film, cast and crew. She made the credits enjoyable and thanked everyone, giving them a small contribution in the film. She did the same in Main Hoon Na.

Deewangi Deewangi with all 31 stars was amazing. It is rather amusing to see all the celebrities dance on screen, with SRK. It was well choreographed and planned, and very enjoyable. OSO really changes it's colours after the interval. It goes from a cheerful happy-go-lucky fun movie into a slightly serious act. Nevertheless, it stills maintains a lot of humour and keeps you glued to your seat.

Entertainment, entertainment, entertainment. Simply unmissable."
Om Shanti Om,Enjoyable popcorn flick!,"Growing up in the 70's and having thoroughly enjoyed Hindi (not yet Bollywood) movies from that decade, I was intrigued when I read reviews about the 70's references in this movie. I wasn't disappointed. The first half of the movie uses some interesting special effects, characterization of stars from that era, and also some very subtle references to stars and film-makers to depict that decade. The cameos of prominent stars throughout the movie adds to the fun factor of the movie.

The movie offers light-hearted entertainment, several enjoyable songs, and some good performances; especially from Shahrukh Khan and the débutante Deepika. Although the movie plot and several key segments are something you have seen before in other movies, OSO's format is irreverent, goofy and enjoyable. Watch this movie for nostalgia, and an overall good time!"
Om Shanti Om,A lot entertainer and senseless movie,"No doubt, that this movie is going to break the box office record. I has made for doing that only. Farah Khan in her second movie kept her promise of giving lot of entertainment, at the same time giving the most senseless and stupid movie. Good or bad I don't know. I will give it to individual to decide.

That is the reason why the movie is having extreme comments. On one side, its is the best for SRK fans (SRK is there in almost every frame of the movie, so much that finally someone may want to throw out). It is also the best for the mass who like to watch comedy, drama, romance, music in one shot. This movie has it all. ""Maa Ka Pyar"", ""Main Maa Bananewali Hoon"", ""Mera Beta Wapas Aayega"", ""Muze Zinda Gaad Diya"" all and many more emotions are packed in this 3 hr movie. But even after that you feel movie is still lengthy specially in second half.

As a really good entertainer the movie gives very good music, dance, dialogs. Acting wise all are good except Deepika, specially in second half. No doubt, why she has so less dialogs.

At the other side the movie is totally unrealistic. Unrealistic characters, unrealistic events, too stupid dialogs. All these points suddenly become clear when you watch 'chak de India' and this movie having less interval in between. I always believe that a movie should be entertaining first, should be able to bind the people to the chair. This movie does that. But then at the times, you also think why the hell have I wasted so much precious time of my life watching this movie.

You can easily see from what I have written that how much confused I am. I am still not able to decide whether the movie is good or bad. Hence I gave an intermediate rating. Let each individual decide it. Meanwhile I will try to forget that I wasted three hours of life, while watching Dard-e-disco on youtube again and again."
Om Shanti Om,Time pass- in the best sense of the phrase,"Saw this movie at an advance screening, and boy, was it amazing.......... it's a total time-pass movie and I mean that in the best sense of the word. Having just seen the heart rending Khuda Ke Liye, OSO was a reminder that life can be fun, filled with colour, love and laughter- and that even if you don't believe in punar janam, Bollywood movies thrive on the topic.

SRK shows why he is the Shahenshah of bollywood, and ALL his friends show up-- there were more cameos in this movie than I could have expected.

One must give credit to the stars who laughed at themselves with such good humour......even those who are supposedly currently at outs with SRK.

Live, Love, Laugh!! at this movie, and remember when not every movie had to have a message."
Om Shanti Om,Masala entertainment with a couple of inspired comic sequences.,Comentario no disponible
Om Shanti Om,An outright entertainer,"OM SHANTI OM tells the story of Om (Shah Rukh Khan) and Shanti (Deepika Padukone). Om is a junior artist in the 70s. Shanti is the reigning superstar. He is her biggest fan. He is in love with her. Om dreams of being a superstar, but an incident changes his life forever. Om dies in a mishap, but is reborn into the present day. He attempts to discover the mystery of his demise

What I liked about the film? Well, almost everything (Yes, I admit, I've sold my soul to SRK)! Which is 98.35 per cent of the film! The film is more a take off on the re-birth formula, than a tribute; but it does brilliantly. Farah Khan has made everyone act superbly (yes, including Arjun Rampal!). There are so many things to watch out for so I will just list a few highlights:

The cameos by almost the entire industry. The fantastic one-liners from '70s Bollywood; The comedy scenes throughout the movie! the digital effects ala Forrest Gump. Deepika Padukone. SRK playing a brash star brat. SRK's abs (of course!). The witty vision of the filmmaker.

And finally Farah Khan and SRK's and the entire film industry's bold move to do a take off on the take off, because, when you look at it, the film is not just a take off on '70s Bollywood but also on today's filmy frenzy! With each and every film one thing is sure Shah Rukh Khan will be outstanding and in this film to he is outstanding as well. In this film Shah Rukh Khan shows His comic abilities and he is bang on target. It just goes to show his range and versatility as an actor that on one hand he is doing Chak De! India (Offbeat) and on other hand Om Shanti Om where he is playing to the gallery which came easily only to Shah Rukh Khan.

Deepika has all it takes to be a top star  the personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too. Standing in the same frame as Shah Rukh Khan and getting it right is no small achievement. She comes as a whiff of fresh air! Arjun Rampal impresses in a negative role which suites his image. Shreyas Talpade compliments Shah Rukh Khan wonderfully. Kirron Kher in one word wonderful.

The masses will love it; the classes will love it too! The youth will like it too, even though they may not get certain references to the Bollywood of yesteryear's. A must watch."
Om Shanti Om,Plenty of fun from one of Bollywood's hippest directors.....,"Rushed out to see this when I heard it would be showing in Pittsburgh on opening day (a rarity in our city for Hindi films these days, unfortunately)....and I can't say I was disappointed.

The film draws its storyline from both ""Kaho Naa....Pyaar Hai"" and ""Madumati"" and features exquisite art direction and cinematography, with Shah Rukh Khan playing both himself and a Hrithik Roshan-style character and Deepika Padukone reviving (pardon the pun) Vyjayanthimala's role in the Roy/Ghatak classic. All of the actors do a fine job, and SRK has some very funny moments in the film (particularly in the first half). The mise-en-scene of the studio-within-the-movie scenes was reminiscent of Guru Dutt's ""Kagaaz Ke Phool,"" and the visual design by director Farah Khan and cinematographer V. Manikandan is exquisite and richly detailed. The pacing isn't quite as tight as in FK's directorial debut ""Main Hoon Na,"" but seems to fit the narrative.

OSO is also loaded with all sorts of ""inside"" references to Hindi (and American) films, past and present, which made this a most enjoyable viewing experience. The ""Filmfare award"" scene and song ""Deewangi Deewangi,"" coming right after the interval, were a blast -- I'll need to see the movie again to catch all of the Hindi stars crammed into those fifteen minutes (the scene also gains a few additional laughs by lampooning the recent stage musical ""Bombay Dreams""). As was done for the cover design of the Beatles'""Sgt. Pepper"" album, someone ought to run a contest to see who can identify everyone in these two scenes! Vishal and Shekhar's soundtrack is very fresh; they do an excellent job hinting at various Indo-pop musical styles from the 60s and 70s. I only wish that the opening title version of ""Om Shanti Om"" would have been included on the CD as well....will just have to wait for the DVD release, I guess.

Now time to head out and see SLB's ""Saawariya,"" which also seems to be playing in Pittsburgh on opening night. The world is definitely changing!"
Om Shanti Om,Why was this movie made ???,"I don't seem to understand the logic behind this movie. Ain't we better off watching spoof on MTV and Star TV that we had to spend 300 bucks for the movie and all because of doctored ratings by the eminent critics of India. Sab Chalta hai if we can package it well and get two words of appreciation from the critics. Why so much of talk about Deepika Padukone ? She is no great actress as she has been made to appear .

If anyone has common sense then we should realize that we have already declared her to be the next best thing even before seeing her on screen ? Ain't we guilty of doing that. Long before movie release,we declared her to be the SuperStar ? (i wonder what kind of superstar were we referring to even before seeing her performance...) This movie is not worth an oounce. Stay away if u have sense and go watch if u are sans sense."
Om Shanti Om,All disco and no dard,"I intended to watch Om Shanti Om as much as Saawariya but Om Shanti Om first because I'm a huge Shah Rukh Khan fan just like everyone else. I've not seen Saawariya yet but I am going to.

Om Shanti Om was soooo entertaining, fun, stylish, colourful, emotional and had a very interesting story (which I loved to bits) told in a good format. Also there is not a Bollywood film made about films.

The first half gave a very good insight of the 70s because this was a rocking decade for Bollywood and I was almost going to cry at the ending of the first half. The second half was even better and reminded me of ""Karan Arjun"". Oh yes! There is a twist in the end that will totally shock you. It was like a delicious desert after a tasty dinner.

Music is excellent composed by one of my most favourite music directors Vishal & Shekhar. The best songs are Ajab Si, Dard-e-disco, Deewangi Deewangi and Main Agar Kahoon. Dard-e-disco is the best music video I have ever seen of the decade....no wait! the best of the century.

The film was about 3 hours but all that time was worth it and there wasn't a single boring or useless scene. The best scenes are: Dard-e-disco song of course, Filmfare awards, Deewangi Deewangi song because there where 30 stars and the ending. In Sajid Khan's ""Heyy Babyy"" there where 14 actresses in cameos and he is Farah Khan's brother.

I've not seen Chak De India because I never got the chance but whether you liked Chak De India or not, you will love Om Shanti Om and if you didn't you can beat me up with a hockey stick. Overall I loved the film it was better than I expected and has a lot of fire. (If you know what I mean)"
Om Shanti Om,"excellent in all fields - comedy, thrill, romance...","I was one of the lucky ones to watch the premier show here in Bahrain today (8-Nov-07). Dipika was excellent. So was most of the bollywood that was casted in this movie! Although most came just for a few seconds but it was done in a nice way and fun! All in all it was a fun movie to watch and gave us laughs, thrilling moments and moments of emotion as well.

I really recommend seeing this movie on the silver screen vs. waiting for a DVD or an inferior print. This movie is full of vibrant colors and sounds and the cinematic experience really adds value to everything.

Do go out and see it. Its one of the films that come out once in every 3-5 years in bollywood so don't miss it!"

Pacific Rim: The Black,Expands the lore while making the previous entry actually mean something,"This show was an unexpected surprise and the trailers and promotional material do it a great disservice. I was expecting something average, maybe a 6 out of 10 but I am glad to say this show is much more nuanced than I know most will give it credit for. And certainly more thought and effort into making it good than the atrocity that was Uprising.

But what was even more unique is that there isn't as much Kaiju fighting as I would've expected which is actually not a con against it as the story it chooses to tell is very much a character one. And I am glad the writers weren't lazy and took the extra mile to actually flesh out these characters properly to the point you really care if something bad happens to them.

Another aspect I really appreciate is that it doesn't ignore the existence of the previous entry Uprising. It demonstrates that Uprising had potential great concepts but this time they'll actually use it. While it doesn't mean Uprising is any better it at the very least justifies it's existence in the lore and expands upon it in many creative ways I did not see coming.

In a way it's kind of like what the Clone Wars show was to the prequels."
Pacific Rim: The Black,"If you liked the first movie, watch this","I almost didn't watch this because I have found most Netflix Anime disappointing. However, I am really glad that I did. This is what the second movie should have been! The anime is good, and obviously anime-ish with many of the standard tropes. Also, I grew up on Robotech in the eighties, watching the anime and reading all of the books. This reminds me of what I remember Robotech being (I went back and tried to re-watch it a few years ago and it disappointed). There is a good balance of mech vs monster, character development, and plot advancement. Well done and I am looking forward to season 2."
Pacific Rim: The Black,Could have been a 9 or 10,"This show could have been a 9 or 10 but nope they had to have a stereotypical girl written into this.

Haileys character annoys me so much that often i forward some of her parts, her whining tantrum voice and her character personality is so annoying.

But onto the good things is that this anime gets to do things that the movies couldnt do in battle scenes or storylines. Wonderful Plot along with amazing visuals makes this a must see anime show.

It would be nice if their were more Jaegars in the show but sadly we dont get to see that. Theirs alot of room for improvement definitely like bringing variety of Jaegars for all to enjoy after all its a Pacific Rim show."
Pacific Rim: The Black,Better than expected! Fills in the void left by the disappointing Pacific Rim: Uprising,"As a massive fan of Guillermo Del Toro's first Pacific Rim who was then let down by the disappointing sequel Pacific Rim Uprising, I quite enjoyed The Black. It is a solid step back into the world of Pacific Rim.

The Black is refreshingly told from a civilian's perspective. So far, we have only seen stories from the military's perspective. The writers do keep the stakes high and the characters consistently disadvantaged to keep the story interesting. Civilians simply do not have the same resources as the military and that naturally freshens things up story-wise. The situation feels less Top Gun and much more Mad Max with a touch of A Quiet Place. The dramatic moments the characters spent out of the Jaegar were equally enjoyable as when they were piloting the Jaegar brawling with the Kaiju.

Taylor and Hayley, the main characters, are teenagers and are angsty. Normally that would be annoying. However, the writers rightfully take advantage of this by having them convincingly make mistakes as any teenager would in these overwhelmingly epic situations, which have real consequences. Even though it is about giant robot fighting giant monsters, the overall approach in how the story deals with its character is realistic and grounded.

What's gone from Pacific Rim: The Black is the sensation of scale. What was fascinating and mindblowing about seeing the first Pacific Rim in theaters was Guillermo Del Toro's sheer commitment to selling how hulkingly huge the Jaegars and the Kaiju were in every frame. It was nail-biting how slow the Jaegars moved and you could feel every gear inside the Jaegar straining to make it through the fight. Every punch mattered. Every punch that landed felt like a World Cup championship victory.

This sense of scale was completely missing in the disappointing sequel Pacific Rim Uprising and it comes and goes throughout The Black, where the Jaegars occasionally move with the dexterity of Olympic gymnasts, but in other moments, that sense of scale and weight is there and that sense of awe comes back, even if it's half the time. I wish this was more consistent throughout the show. There's real cinematic magic when that works and it just raises all the hairs on my arms.

My quibbles aside, the fights are still pretty darn fun. They are well choreographed and rightfully build on details from the Pacific Rim films. There are some exhilarating action moments that will make fans cheer. I particularly enjoyed how the writers further explore the Drift and like the first Pacific Rim, uses it effectively as a story device to develop the relationships between the Jaegar pilots and intensifies the battles.

The first season for The Black does end abruptly, as if a producer came in andlopped off half of the show with a machete and deemed a mid-season cliffhanger as the new shortened season finale. When it happened, it had me doing a triple take going, ""Wait, what? That was over?""

Regardless, I do intend to watch the second season to see what happens. The show was better than expected and it did win me over.

Overall, I'd recommend The Black to Pacific Rim fans. Fans who enjoyed the first film and was let down by the second and still have unfinished business in this universe are keen to enjoy this show."
Pacific Rim: The Black,I had an awesome time!,"Binged this series of one of my most favorite franchises. In my opinion, it surpasses both the movies. It is really complex yet fun to watch, and the characters are very memorable. I had a blast! Can't wait for season 2!"
Pacific Rim: The Black,Wish they had expanded the range of the story more,"If you like the genre and Pacific rim movies/ story then you'll most likely enjoy it. Its not a gem but its entertaining enough. I only wish it was a bit more to the story and perhaps a bit longer. The plot gives an impression it will be sort of like Firefly or Star Trek, what I mean is the kids have the big mech as their home/travel medium and as they travel around on their ""mission"" (parents) ,meet people,have experiences,help etc.. All the while the jaeger (big mech) would be their safe comfy home. I would much more prefer it like that, an episodic,every episode a short story while at the same time slowly pushing forward the main storyline. But as is, the plot is very shallow, the range of their experience is extremely limited with only a handful of characters and even less kaji. Too bad, because if they put a bit more effort into it and went the other route, with each ep having an individual either action/moral quandry/emotional/sad storyline while staying on the main road, this animation would've been A LOT better."
Pacific Rim: The Black,This needed more than 6 episodes,"This anime was something. It felt like it wanted too add every monster movie idea into a six episodes. Like they took ideas from multiple franchisee of monster flicks or shows and said ""we'll add this, a little bit of that, put this there"" and then shoved it out the door. I was all for the idea of kids going on an adventure to find their parents but then they add so many other ideas that just felt like this was an amateur writer's first attempt at fanfiction."
Pacific Rim: The Black,MORE!!! ^^,"Great and beautiful Anime. Cool Characters, Jäger and Kaiju's. A great Mix between Metal Gear Solid, Strike Suit Hero and possibly also the mysterious Project G.G. by Platinum Games. (^?^) Hopefully Season 2 comes out SOON, rather than a Year from now. I WANT MORE !!! ^^"
Pacific Rim: The Black,it's ok.,"I actually liked the show, for a 3d animated show, it was really done well, the action scenes felt fluid and real, overall quite good. characters wise not so much, that where I have a problem with this series, no really stood out to me, no character development at all, i might understand considering the show is 23 min long and just 7 episode but I think they could have made a character stand out tho. pacing was fast too, I do question most of the characters decision making. anyway the show is quite good to while away time"
Pacific Rim: The Black,Pacific Rim: The Black builds upon the franchise's strengths working as both a continuation and introduction to new fans.,"Sometime after what has become known as the Uprising War from the last movie, a third Precursor invasion happens in Australia decimating the continent and forcing the Pan Pacific Defense Corps (PPDC) to abandon the continent and retreat. 5 years after the invasion, as Hayley and Taylor Travis (Gideon Adlon and Calum Worthy) await rescue from the PPDC in a hidden sanctuary with diminishing hope of rescue. After Hayley unearths a disused training Jaegar named Atlas Destroyer, the activation of the mechnisms inadvertantly alerts a Kaiju to the sanctuary's location destroying all but Hayley and Taylor. With their home destroyed and no rescue in sight, Hayley and Taylor must now venture through the ruins of Australia with their Jaegar venturing into the harsh wastes know to Survivors as The Black.

Back in 2013 Guillermo del Toro graced multiplexes with Pacific Rim, a fun take on Japanese monster films and super robot anime filtered through the lens of a big budget blockbuster. While the film garnered respectable box office numbers, it's digital footprint didn't translate to the level of success the studio was hoping for and most likely would've been written off as a disappointment had it not been for the film's massive success in Asian markets, particularly China, which eventually opened the door for the sequel, 2018's Pacific Rim: Uprising, with del Toro stepping back into a producing role and handing the reins to Spartacus and Daredevil director Steven S. DeKnight. Uprising is very flawed movie, it has some good elements in it and I like how it's tone is less apocalyptic (to a point) but without the gravitas del Toro added to the first one, Uprising came off in many ways like a big budget fan fiction including creating a previously unmentioned brother for Mako Mori with Jake Pentecost and not even addressing the previous protagonist Raleigh Beckett. Pacific Rim: The Black takes place some indeterminate amount of time after Uprising and while it does build upon elements from Uprising, it's not required viewing to understand or enjoy Pacific Rim: The Black. While the format may have changed for Pacific Rim: The Black, it still manages to deliver on the series' strengths while expanding the universe in new and interesting ways.

From the outset, The Black despite being animated is clearly taking its inspirations from the first film as many times the Jaeger/Kaiju battles are shot from street level views to give a sense of scale and weight to the battles and it's opening sequence where Australia is being invaded is very well done. The show also goes back to the first movie's themes of survivors guilt and carrying shared weight as it focuses on a brother and sister who've grown up in a world without their parents. Taylor is overly serious and no nonsense being a former Jaeger cadet prior to the fall of Australia, and takes a hardline stance when it comes to his sister's well being, while Hayley is more impulsive and brazen in her actions. It's a good dynamic that makes for rich familial drama but doesn't teeter over the edge into melodrama. The sequence where the Hayley inadvertantly activates the Jaeger and alerts a nearby Kaiju to the sanctuary has some absolutely haunting moments of terror as their friends and loved ones are massacred and the survivor's guilt felt by Hayley makes for compelling viewing especially in the friction it causes in their relationship.

While the characters are certainly rich and have some great exchanges, it helps that the world The Black creates feels unique (at least in terms of the Pacific Rim universe). Being set in Australia, it should surprise absolutely no one that there's more than a few passing similarities to the world of Mad Max with roving gangs of scavengers and marauders which surprisingly mesh really well in a world of monsters, giant robots, and other sci-fi gadgets. The show does a good job of creating an ongoing mystery as Hayley and Taylor search for their missing parents and introducing elements such as a mute albino boy, what seems to be a Jaeger/Kaiju hybrid, and many other dangling plot threads that are given just enough intrigue and answer to keep you wanting more.

What issues I do have with Pacific Rim: The Black are fairly minor, but I'd be remiss if I didn't address them. The animation is really good at the Kaiju/Jaeger battles, but the show struggles with the human moments every so often. For the most part the human models are perfectly serviceable, but being a CG series with anime aesthetics sometimes facial features will seem unnaturally flat or feel somewhat doll like in how they interact. There's also some situations where they attempt to do more dynamic and complex camera movements with the humans such as an instance involving a 360 degree arc shot inside a damaged Jaeger that gave the appearance the character in the fore ground was floating. As many have pointed out the show is only 7 episodes long. To the writers' credit the story never feels rushed or anything, but some of the emotional crescendo and dramatic payoffs may have elicited greater impact had they been allowed more time to develop.

Pacific Rim : The Black is a good addition to the franchise. While the compressed storytelling and somewhat rough animation at certain points can be distracting, the show continues building upon the interesting world built in the first tow films and populating it with interesting characters and compelling narratives."
Pacific Rim: The Black,So much hype for this has payed off!,Comentario no disponible
Pacific Rim: The Black,"Came in without expectations, left wanting more.","I am a fan of the first movie and hated the second one. I love seeing kaiju fighting mechas and as in the first movie, the series has a lot of amazing fights. However it also suffers the same problem as in the first movie, i.e. a relatively weak and an oddly paced story, admittedly better than the movie though. But lets face it, nobody watches Pacific Rim for the plot only and here a serviceable plot is all i needed to enjoy the amazing animation, the very good sound track, the good voice acting and above all Jägers punching Kaijus!"
Pacific Rim: The Black,Better than the movies,"This is another decent anime series from Netflix. The graphics are well done, the voice acting is good and the story is decent. Fight sequences could have been a bit better. There is decent character development, especially for an anime series. Looking forward to another season."
Pacific Rim: The Black,Way to ruin a show!,Comentario no disponible
Pacific Rim: The Black,A Bit Cliché for Shonen but a Decent Start Nonetheless,"Going in make sure you realize this is about as rough as Castlevania season 1 one of my major gripes with this show is the fact that Pacific Rim was an awesome live action Kaiju anime that was never supposed to become an anime itself. The only reason this show exists is to retcon Uprising (2018). Another major flaw is the fact has a lot of clichés such as AOT references, NGE references and other anime tropes. Then you have western tropes like the fact this is CGI and NOT traditional animation. The main characters make so many damn mistakes it's like watching me in front of my crush (Fs in the chat). The story writing is weak despite being penned by Craig Kyle, co-writer of Thor: Ragnarok, and Greg Johnson, head writer of the 2000 series X-Men: Evolution. The characterization is weak as well Mei is basically the edgy female empowerment character but she does have a cool relationship with Taylor (The brother guy). The main villain is also cringe the Australian bad guy who is literally the only man in the show that has an Australian accent, like seriously Netflix couldn't get Australian actors to voice characters living in Australia? I'll give them a pass on that one given Pacific Rim the movies did the same thing.

Now, onto the positives; the show has a pretty good CGI team behind it (MAPPA) the same people that did Attack on Titan Season 4, of course there are noticeable sharp edges and unnatural character movement but for what is basically a 3 hour animated movie it's not half bad. I liked Haley's character a lot. Her voice actor does a good job and her milk jugs aren't half bad as well if you catch my drift. Taylor is an ok protagonist with the same voice as pretty much every Shonen male lead, he's depicted as half competent, sassy and pretty much the only intelligent man or woman in the show. The Yeager design for the protagonists is great; it reminds me of Gipsy Danger but with a weaker less impressive weapons arsenal. The ending saves the show for me. It brings about a plot twist (that I saw coming halfway through but I still thought they wouldn't do), this show has potential and if it gets a good amount of support and a sizable fanbase they can make longer more well throughout seasons but for now I'm just holding out hope.

Tldr; Worth watching if you've seen the movies or are even slightly curious (not a lot of spoilers about the movies although a couple deaths are mentioned). If you hate CGI anime and iffy cliché Shonen plot writing you should probably watch it anyways because season 2 is gonna be epic. 7/10 The ending saves the show."
Pacific Rim: The Black,bearable i guess,"Now don't get me wrong, I think the show is ok and might watch a season 2 if it ever get renewed but I don't like a lot of things in the show, the way they deal with grief and all that, I don't advice wallowing in self hate or whatever but after they saw what that monster did to their village and the way they went about it like OK it ain't out fault, moving on... when clearly it was, disturbed me. dude who I liked so far was the villain guy, the rest was just one dimensional... Lol, and the whole looking for parent thing felt stupid for it to be considered a motivation, I just needed something for me to cheer for the siblings, they make it so hard especially the girl. mei is OK tho"
Pacific Rim: The Black,It makes Uprising look like a masterpiece,"This show is unbelievably boring, it's such a disappointment for the universe. You never get to know the characters so their deaths are meaningless, the main characters have no personalities and no unique character designs. On top of that the animation is extremely choppy.

I don't believe there is even a single jaeger fight in this what feels like eternity long show.

And the plot is so unbelievably horrible, and I never grew attached to any of the characters.

Overall this show is an attempt of milking money from an already overextended series."
Pacific Rim: The Black,"Surely better than the second movie, and a solid addition to the franchise","I was deeply disappointed by the second Pacific Rim movie. It had so many issues that it's hard to describe. Not that one has huge expectations from a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters, but still. When compared to the first, it's miles behind.

The animation has some pretty low bar to cross and it does it well. It's a light tone mix with some rather very dark elements. It's not always best but it passes the smell test. The animation is okay mostly. Some character models could be better but that's nitpicking. The bigger issues is the supporting voice cast, their performances are pretty low tier sadly. With that said, direction is rock solid. Good camera choices and visual setup. For me, this was one of the worst parts of the second movie.

Still a very much enjoyable experience. I would have liked some more robot action and better voice casts but hey, it's more giant robots fighting giant monsters."
Pacific Rim: The Black,fantastic,"Ignore the bad reviews here. This is another great edition - Hope they do alot more too. Acting is good, animation is awesome, characters are great too. Im glad this was made. And I to see more."
Pacific Rim: The Black,better than other CGI Netflix animes,"Wish all animes had this level of Engl. voice acting (like Naruto anime could have used this level).. that aside, I'm giving this a 8/10, for the effort and cause it's a step up from the average Netflix CGI anime (still prefer less CGI animes, .. only few can mix CGI well, like Demon Slayer) ... it's still overall generic, but not as bad as previous Netflix CGI animes.., and enjoy the apocalyptic setting, better writing and not too exaggerated characters as other such animes (imo better than the Godzilla Anime)"
Pacific Rim: The Black,Why 10 out of 10,"I'm a normy, I love anime and after seeing the movies and watching anime all of my life, I have to say I really liked this series, I'm really dissappointed that there were no more episodes. I'm also giving it a 10 out of 10 because I want to see more! The story is not generic, it doesn't copy other tales and it keeps you at the edge of your seat. I won't to know more about Boy and the siblings. Please please get us more seasons and more episodes. 7 episodes is too little. Watch it, you will like it if you are a fan of anime."
Pacific Rim: The Black,"While the sci-fi is even more out there than the movies, the animated kaiju and jaeger look awesome, and this significantly expands the world building of the movies! :-)","Looks beautiful, and has lots of cool action and heart! :-)"
Pacific Rim: The Black,Almost perfect. Trainer's Jaeger is a smart idea.,"I have watched all Pacific Rim series and this is the latest one. As an Anime it is close to perfect. There is only one glitch: the accent. As the whole story happens in Oz, I would expect the dub in an accent of Oz/NSW. Obviously this is just partially the case. Still, it's just too minor to reduce a star from this iconic Anime. 10/10!!!

A bonus point: the use of a Training Jaeger in combat is simply brilliant. Less is more."
Pacific Rim: The Black,Not bad!,"Kinda good CGI, awesome drawings. Exciting, interesting, but sometimes predictable story. Poor soundtrack compared to the firsg movie's which is legendary. But I'm not supprised. The credits soundtrack is kinda cool but it last for 10 seconds or so. The op thought is good.
This was written after E7 - (obviously the story isn't finished)
Absolutely recommend watching it if you liked the first movie even if just a little bit."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Solid show, but...","Enjoyed it. Was better than I expected. However...

There was no finale. It just... ends. There are ten different plot threads all left wide open. I thought there were two episodes left to wrap up the season, instead it was over.

This wasn't a split season. It's not even renewed yet. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with a show ending on a cliffhanger. I expect it. But every episode ends with one, and every previous episode had a better one than the ""finale"".

A season needs to finish with a sense of completion somewhere, not just roll straight into the next one. Severance did this as well. After the last episode I thought, ""man, the season finale is going to be fierce!""

Instead, it's just... show over. Hope you still remember the characters and storylines a year and a half from now, because there won't be any resolution until then. That is, assuming the show survives the writers strike.

Overall, enjoyed the show. I'm not much of a binger, but my wife and I finished it in a couple of days. If my entire review is complaining it ended too soon, I suppose I'd recommend it."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Abusive Use of Imaginative Scenes,"I'm not into the serial killer hype. I even avoid horror and thriller genres these days. But the fun and excitement tone of the show successfully lure me to watch till the 8th episode.

My main gripe about the show is the ABUSIVE AMOUNT of MISLEADING & IMAGINATIVE SCENES (including one in the finale episode) that try to trick audiences to think or feel something about the respective Plots, before the editors abruptly switch them back to IRL scenes. The cheap tactic becomes more and more ANNOYING to me as the show progresses. Hope they won't use it again in future season, should they gain enough traction in viewership to validate continuation."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Let's Look At This Another Way,"After reading all the negative reviews here, I threw my own negative review away and started over. I'm going to call this a campy murder romp instead.

I was expecting more from Exec Prod Jason Bateman after Ozark. And while this COULD've been done more darkly like Ozark, I see now that they were playing the social media fame obsession AND murder story only for laughs and gags. Does it work? Kinda. Maybe. The jokes and dialogue could be smarter. The use of dream sequences gets a little overworked.

Cuoco and Messina play two desperate and bumbling fame-seekers who do some completely implausible things in an effort to chase notoriety but only get deeper into trouble. It's kind of a send-up of the whole social media true crime phenomenon, but it's not an obvious satire. It works if you go into it with the idea that you, the viewer, are smarter than all of the characters on the screen. They're going to prove you right in every scene.

Yes, it's obviously implausible that anyone would do any of the things that happen here. Or is it? Social media has shown that not everyone is as smart as us.

I like Cuoco and Messina but not their characters. I just want them to call the cops and end the shenanigans. And the Matt character is a bit over the top, but if you look at it like a send-up, it helps.

Don't be taken by surprise when S-1 just kind of ends without resolution. That's how it goes."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Very entertaining,"I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews on here that border on the unhinged. Based on a True Story is a lot of fun and often very funny, helped hugely by its pacing across eight 30min episodes.

To be clear, this is not some sort of rip-off or pale imitation of Only Murders in the Building, which is a totally different type of show and which sits firmly in the whodunnit genre. Based on a True Story is just a dark comedy about desperate people and the American obsession with murder that's been given a revamp thanks to the podcast and streaming industry.

Sure, Kaley Cuoco once again plays Kaley Cuoco proving she has the acting range of a goldfish - but she's watchable, as is most of the cast. And I do agree with others who have pointed out that the frequent dream sequences are both pointless and annoying.

Definitely worth a binge watch and I hope there's more to come because this series felt more like a scene setter than the beginning, middle and end."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,It's good enough!,"To be honest, I wasn't all that excited for this series, but I gave the show a chance and it was decent. Now that the second season is over, I still think this show is decent.

Positives for Based on a True Story (2023-): I think the setup of this series is pretty good and it was interesting for the most part. Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina as Ava and Nathan are pretty good in the show and they have some fun banter between themselves and other characters. There are some cool and unique kills with a decent amount of gore to them in the show. The whodunnit aspect of the series was fun and I was intrigue with where the mysteries were going. And finally, this is one of those series that I wouldn't mind seeing more seasons of it.

Negatives for Based on a True Story (2023-): There are a number of things that annoyed in the series. First off, you have Tom Bateman as Matt Pierce and while he is certainly doing a good job with his character the way he was intended to be, there are moments where he got on my nerves and I wanted to kick his ass. There are also a number of dream sequences in this series that I hated and they do it too many times. And finally, some of the answers to these mysteries didn't sit well with me.

Overall, I had a decent time with Based on a True Story (2023-) and while I didn't fully love it, I wouldn't hate seeing more seasons from this show."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Where's the 9th episode,"Actors are great in their roles. Lot of fun to watch just need to enjoy the ride. First time I've seen Kaley in something and she's great. Always love Chris. Actor playing other lead- no spoiler- is highly entertaining and I'll be looking for him in other projects Feeling pressure to submit another 300 characters

All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy All work and no play make Jack a dull boy."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Let's do a true crime podcast with the serial killer...what could go wrong?,"Jason Bateman is great and we checked out this series based on his touch and the premise. Following in the wake of Only Murders in The Building, this series is also a satire about Americans' current obsession with true crime.

A down, out...and pregnant LA couple figure out who the local serial killer (aka The Westside Ripper) is and instead of going to the police, in order to get fame and make money, decide to do a podcast with the killer instead. This leads to lots of dark comedy when they do things like attend a true crime convention!

Lots of moral questions are brought up but everything is pretty tongue in cheek. I am not a big fan of Kaley Cuoco, who plays the wife Ava Bartlett...but the best thing I can say is she didn't ruin the series for me, although her hair in her face during every scene was driving me crazy. Give that girl a barrette or ponytail holder, please. The male lead was a bit whiny as a has been tennis pro who is now a has been instructor being put out to kids classes...and then fired. The rest of the cast was pretty fantastic. I appreciated the fun that was poked at the rich ""LA"" couples who are their friends.

If you are a fan of true crime, comedy, satire...and some decent writing, I think you will enjoy this series (at least the first season)."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,It was fun! Slow in places though...,"...I have been waiting for this show for a long time! I was so excited and of course binged the whole thing. Easy to watch but it does drag just a bit in places. Not enough that I turned it off or lost interest! It has soooo many amazing people too. I've loved many of the things the leads are in. I do hope it's renewed for a second season because I want them to amp it up and tell more of the murderers story and give us more murders haha. It's such a great concept too. In this world of true crime and podcasts and making millions it just make sense that someone would eventually team up with a murderer to be able to tell the stories first. Bateman is great! They all are were great truthfully, not a bad actor in the bunch. I'll be here for the next installment for sure."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"Addictive, fun, well done, and a dab of horrifying guilty pleasure","I wanted to uprate it to a 9 or 10, but the subject was so kind of horrible, I felt like because of everything that is so excellent about it, I had to compromise. It is a classic guilty pleasure for sure! I am not one who thinks murder and especially psychopathic serial killers should be, in any way, celebrated. This show is very well done. The cast is beyond fantastic. It made me laugh more than I like to admit. It is a thrill ride from the second episode until the final episode, which was a major cliffhanger, making us want more. But in today's violent society? I have to admit, be aware that to a certain extent, Based on a True Story has a very psychopathic edge to it.

I suppose there are different ways to look at this show. It is so edgy and humorous and off the wall, it is hard to take it seriously. I am not a prude or a judgy person, but in retrospect, I am a little embarrassed to recommend this to my friends. Obviously, I have very mixed feelings about this show because of the subject matter. That being said, I watched it to the end like eating potato chips. I will leave it as a guilty pleasure and feel guilty that I really, really want to see another season. Just be aware, this show is not for the faint of heart! And I want a second season because I am hoping there will be some sort of closure of the subject matter to those who have experienced severe losses of innocents murdered, and will see real justice win! It is a great thrill ride, includes a lot of humor, but with some very nasty people and issues involved! JMHO."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Where was the resolution?,"Here's the thing... It's a fun and funny show. The leads all carry their parts well, especially Kaley Cuoco. (It's a different character than the one she did in Flight Attendant, but the energy is very much the same, which is a good thing.)

My issue with the series is that there was no resolution. They set everything up for a season 2, but all of the storylines of this first season are unresolved. There are so many shows that know how to do this much better. In this day-and-age of remarkable TV writing (and again, this show had some great writing), it's inexcusable to me to not land the ending. It doesn't need to be a 10/10, but at least give us a 7/10, a B-, a 73% tomato, or whatever you want to call it. Even ""The Boys"", this same creator's other big series, wraps up the storylines each season while also setting up new ones for the next season, so they should have some vague idea as to HOW to do this. It's just annoying to watch the entire season, get invested in the show and it's characters, and then have absolutely no significant ending to anything. Makes it feel like I wasted my time.

Not sure if I'd give a 2nd season a try, based on how cheated I feel."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Loved it,"I loved this show. The way the the film industry represents the current trends never seems to properly land, but this show naturally weaves it. It turns true crime and social media into a comedic, thrilling, entertaining show. It's witty and rightly paced while keeping you on your toes, it rare you get so many turn of emotions in one show. It portrays the average modern person in large cities we'll and doesn't skip out on the mind of one and plays around with it. Also, on something that is extremely heavy this show brings a light hearted approach to the situation. I watched this in one sitting and going to be devastated if it gets canceled. Personally, it's a really fun watch, it's nothing extreme in any subject and that's truly what I love about it. I would highly recommend."

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,So much potential,"I enjoyed the plot and the characters but felt the imaginary scenes spoiled it, as when something shocking happened it mostly turned out to be in their imagination. Then when something happened that was shocking you thought it was another imaginary scene. And really the imaginary scenes were a protracted and a waste of time.

I did like that it was a little in the vein of Santa Clareta Diet in some ways but would have enjoyed it more if there was more dark humour.

The characters have so much potential but need to be less serious and keep the killing going. It's ludicrous but insane humour. Don't know if I would recommend it to my friends as there are to many flaws but theyy could be fixed on season 2. Oh and they need to improve on the hairstyles."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Get past 1st episode,"I love a series which doesn't take itself too seriously. I wanted to throw the towel during the 1st episode as ""Based on a true story"" seemed to be predictable and uninspired. But then t got me hooked. The actors are great. Tom Bateman gives a career making performance. And Kuoco continues her winning streak, becoming America's next Goldie Hawn. This series has a lot of dark humor and keeps surprising me - which is exact what I want.

Since Öztürk I am a huge Jason Bateman fan. And knowing that he is one of ""Based on a true story""'s producers is another indication that the series is worth watching . From my point of view it's an evolution of "" Only murders in the building"" and I like it a lot more."
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,This Show!!!!,"Omg! First of all, the cast is FANTASTIC!! What a great job casting this!! Everything Jason Bateman touches is gold.

This series has some hilarious moments and still keeps the edge. It is fast paced, energetic and entertaining.

I really cannot wait to see where this goes. I can't imagine which is the hallmark of a good TV show. It's not just for true crime fans but if you are a true crime fan, you'll laugh!

Chris Messina is WONDERFUL!! My favorite character. Just hilarious! The female lead, however, is just as terrific. They have a great on screen chemistry.

The fantasy scenes ARE THE BEST!!! Oh thank you!!"
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"A Dark, Hilarious Thriller","From the brutal start that felt like it was paying homage to Drew Barrymore's iconic murder scene in 'Scream' to the shocking moments that followed, each episode held my attention. Kaley Cuoco and Chris Messina deliver magnetic performances, making their characters relatable and engaging. Tom Bateman's portrayal of the very scary Matt Pierce brings a chilling authenticity to the role of a serial killer.

The Peacock series pokes fun at society's obsession with murder, satirizing our fascination with serial killers and true crime podcasts. After the first episode, I couldn't resist binge-watching the rest. The fast-paced events and gripping plot kept me on the edge of my seat. Each episode flew by in minutes, enhanced by a fun soundtrack that heightened the chaotic atmosphere of the show.

It's a must-watch for fans of dark comedies and true crime podcasts. With its blend of lighthearted drama, and intense moments, it satisfies cravings for captivating storytelling. Cuoco, Messina, and Bateman deliver standout performances, creating characters that were, relatable, engaging and endearing.

Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,"S1 great, S2 wtf","Season 1 was great. Great concept, good acting, good viewing, great execution. 10/10. Episodes quite short so easy to binge entire season quite quickly. I'd say it's similar vibe to The Flight Attendant that Kaley Cuoco was in (again, s1 of that was miles better).

Season 2. No, no, no. Like, I still watched it, so it wasn't horrific, but it was awful compared to season 1. Why do they try to change it just because it's a new season? Why not just continue the same as season 1 which clearly worked? Also, it just ended...wouldn't even say it ended on a cliffhanger, it just ended as if it was another episode and now I assume we have to wait for s3?"
Jimmy: The True Story of a True Idiot,Not what I expected. It was way better!!,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really like Kaley Cuoco. This show has some good acting and characters. She plays a pregnant woman well. It was funny and very entertaining also. I like the actor who plays Matt and Kaleys husband. His backstory about being an old tennis pro. The whole story and sure was really good. I really like the way they integrate the flashbacks into the show. Some of them are ready to identify, but a couple of them I didn't see coming and wasn't sure if they were real. Overall I would definitley recommend it. Give it a watch! You just might enjoy it."
Knightfall,Very Interesting.,The show begun very poorly. If I remember right the first 2-3 episodes were hard to watch. Poor performances by all the actors and it seemed as a very low budget production. But since that the show has made an huge leap forward and it is Safe to say that in second season now it is one of my favorite shows at the moment. Really give it a try up to second season.
Knightfall,Factually inaccurate but entertaining,"Group of knights templar get involved in the schemes and politics of the French court, while also on the hunt for the holy grail. Kind of a mix between arthurian legend and the 3 musketeers, nothing particularly original so far, I've seen up to ep 8 season 1, but it's been entertaining and I will keep on watching, however for a show made by the history channel I wish the makers put much more effort in to make it historically accurate, as its portrayal is very factually inaccurate."
Knightfall,Enjoyable series.,"So what that the series is historically inaccurate. It's still entertaining to me. I loved Vikings and didnt know squat about their history. Point being,the writing is not the best but the acting is good. Put some quality writers with these actors,you'll have a top notch show. Knights Templar has always been a romantic story of men fighting for the good. So this woman looks at it from this angle."
Knightfall,Hit and miss but just enough to be worthwhile,At tones it can be monotonously slow but when it clicks into gear it can really work the best evidence of this was in the second half of season 2 and the season 1 finale. The rest of the time it varies between average and good but could work on it's overall pacing. There is a lot worse out there and I personally overall enjoyed it and hope to see a 3rd season as it appears to be improving and learning from past mistakes as the cast grow into their roles with experience.
Knightfall,uneven muddled writing,"In 1291 Acre, the Templar Knights lose their last foothold in the Holy Lands and the Holy Grail sinks to the bottom of the sea. Fifteen years later in Paris, Brother Landry is a close confident to King Philip and Queen Joan of France. Isabella is their desirable daughter and William De Nogaret is their villainous advisor. Landry argues for a retaking of the Holy Lands. Master Godfrey is killed leaving a clue to the Grail. Pope Boniface VIII makes Landry the new Temple Master as the quest for the Grail begins.

It's a clunky mix of history and melodrama. Tom Cullen has the beard and the quiet intensity. I'm not sold on his leading man credentials. The writing is too muddled. For much of the show, the hero is tilting at windmills. The opposition is so powerful that the premise seems hopeless. That's not a fun place to live and this is not actually a fun show. While it has its moments, this show is too uneven to maintain any momentum. Like everybody else, History Channel tried its hand at scripted drama. With all the other streaming services, I'm sure that this got lost in the shuffle."
Knightfall,Great show if you discount historical innaccuracy,"First of all, every negative review that's based on historical inaccuracy is correct. This show has absolutely nothing in common with the actual history of the Knights Templar. However, as a history buff and enthusiast I'm a bit perplexed by the outrage. The show and its commercials never tried to portray the show as historically accurate. So in my opinion, the negative reviews based on historical inaccuracy have no merit.

This show follows on the foot of vikings. Its supposed to be a show based on the Knights Templar but that's where the similarities end. What I judge a show by is cohesive plot, characters acting logically to drive the plot, entertainment value and acting. For the most part the show does a great job in all those categories. The only glaring negative point about the show is that the plot is a bit predictable sometimes. Otherwise, its great entertainment. I give the show a solid 8.5/10. The 10 rating from above is to balance out all the unjustified low ratings."

Knightfall,"cheesy, easy, not very exciting","I am mostly easy or forgiving when is comes to historic series, especially when they are done with care for scenery, dialogues and eye for detail of sets. The very first half hour of the pilot I got bored with religion, Christian or Jewish, and the simple mindedness about good and evil. throw in bad camera work and not very good (or bad) acting and what I was left with was disappointment. Not getting that feel of a good knight series which should be out there alongside the current viking and cowboy and other fantasy more-or-less-based-on-reality series."

Knightfall,Cheap effects and so-so acting makes this one a complete disappointment,"Well, just started with this series, since I like history in general and well, Vikings is one of my top shows these days so I said, ""why not?"".

First of all, actors are in meh in general; I didn't believe them when telling their stories.

Special effects are so lame that I can compare them to those seen in those low-budget movies that have similar names to blockbusters and come out a little earlier but are complete garbage (i.e., Operation Dunkirk http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6836772).

I will give it a second chance and continue watching the episodes, but I don't feel engaged enough, though."
Knightfall,I do not care,I do not care if it is historically correct. Nice show. Nice plot twists. Some nice philosophical and theological thought triggers.
Knightfall,"Drama, Action, Intrigues, Sex and a cheesy love story - What's not to like? :)","I'm currently on episode 6 of Knightfall, and i must say; I have been well entertained so far!

If you can look past the historical inaccuracies and the occasional lazy writing - Knightfall is actually a quit entertaining ride..

Defiantly not a masterpiece, but one of those shows were you can turn your brain off and just enjoy a straight forward story, the occasional surprising twist of events and sometimes have a laugh when the writing is overly simplified and the characters do some seriously questionable things.. Like for an example, the boy that just lost his wife in a brutal way, falls in love again soon after in a girl he's only known for like a min! (That's lazy writing to me)..

If you watch Knightfall, don't expect a grand historical drama, but rather a fairly enjoyable Action/drama with historical elements!

Have fun everyone :)"
Knightfall,Fun to watch if you make it past the first episode,"The first episode is not the best. Too many characters, nothing explained, King Arthur's grail? But by the end of Episode 3, I was hooked. The plot moves quickly with action, intrigue, a mystery to solve, medieval France (set a bit earlier than Braveheart), so pretty fun and entertaining. This show is not deep and the ""twists"" are easy to see coming. But the actors really sell it and the sets are great. And I like that all the main characters have lots of ""gray"", not all good, not all bad. I'm a sucker for historical shows so looking forward to finishing the season!"
Knightfall,So much more potential,Yeah I get they wanted intrigue. I think they've jumped the shark with the female Asian assassin. Because yeah that's so totally not Hollywood.
Knightfall,A crime against History,"When people say sad things like ""historical accuracy doesn't matter in entertainment"" shows like knightfall are the result. History is rich and vibrant, full of humanity's glories and misdeeds, by making knights that contradict historical knights you make characters that are less believable, a story that is less immersive and a plot that just feels poorly recycled. Even taken on its own merits the show is poor, but to do this to such a fascinating group as the templars is just wrong"
Knightfall,Underrated,"Yes, it is predictable if you overthink it while watching instead of enjoying the experience. So if you start watching it with the intention of wanting to think of it as bad like some people here seem to do you wont enjoy it.

If you however start watching it without prejudices you'll enjoy a great and well acted show with beautiful detailed costumes and settings that feel like they're straight of of the time itself."
Knightfall,really bad but compulsive viewing,"Ok there is 2 things you need to know about this show

1 it is really bad and

2 it is compulsive viewing

I have to hand it to the script writers, they are off their heads.

I nearly quit after the first episode, such was my disappointment, I wish they had not used the Knights Templar as their premise for the show as it makes a mockery of this historical order, but, once I realised that this has no actual bearing in fact, I got over it.

Maybe they should have called this, men with beards and swords.

Just think period drama with a lot of sword fighting with nonsensical plot twists poor continuity and every cliché you can think of.

It is more like a Arthurian saga, I am sure they stole some of the Knights names from the legends, it is likely that the script writer does not know the difference between the Knights of king Arthur and the Knights Templar, as from a historical POV they do not seem to have any degree of knowledge on this subject

It is a pity they did not try a little bit harder with the plot as the sets and action sequences are pretty good, never the less it is still watchable if only to see how stupid the plots are, at times it is cringeworthy but it always somehow redeems itself enough to remain watchable in an OMG that was predictable kind of way.

A crazy show where the script writers get to indulge themselves with plots that have no basis in fact or reality - it is completely audacious, off the wall stupid.

sometimes something is so bad that it is good."
Knightfall,A Two Edged Sword,"I like a mystery and the fictional Universe doesn't really matter - when i saw a trailer about a the legendary Templar i thought to myself "" This might be a show i might enjoy "" The acting was great, but the story line for a first episode was a disaster. It felt like a was watching another disastrous Hollywood remake without a story line moving the story forward and instead an action filled driven narrative.

And the worst part - they raped mythology in the very first episode. They hired C-rated writers who pitched a concept, but without a storyteller.

Scenery, effects, actors and acting - *All great

Writers - *A total disaster"
Knightfall,"Not historic, but fun to watch.","Whole the ""history"" is questionable at best , the action and story are fast paced and riveting. blood, lust , intrigue, all you need for a great adventure series. Just remember its fantasy and go with the flow."
The Skin of the Wolf,,
Alexa & Katie,Low-budget delight,"Alexa and Katie is perfectly enjoyable for all ages.

A bit too melodramatic but I don't really care.

The characters are perfect, Alexa's older brother is incredible, I love him.

Netflix gave us a great show here."
Alexa & Katie,ALEXA & KATIE: How teen shows should be.,"PROS:

-A really mature premise. The story focuses on Alexa. She has cancer, and we will be watching how this affects to this girl and her family.

-The emotional moments are golden. I found myself crying into half of the episodes of each season. It's simply amazing, and it really opens a conversation.

-It's entertaining and short. Every episode it feels like the plot is moving forward. I mean, every season take place a year on the girls lives.

CONS:

-Sitcom laughs that makes you feel like the show is forcing you to laugh to jokes that aren't that funny. It's essentially a Disney show with a mature thematic.

-May not appeal to boys.

-Some jokes aren't really funny and sometimes it's very corny."
Alexa & Katie,Great clean family show with good messages,"Fantastic family show, good mixed of silly humour with empathy for a variety of struggles younger people can face particularly around illness. Great themes explored as well as good friendships modelled. Nice and clean as well as hilarious and entertaining. Just waiting for the next season now!"
Alexa & Katie,It's a kids show and not a documentary!,"This is a fantastic show for kids- better than Disney because the kids aren't disrespectful and rude to adults. It shows great friendships and the challenges of dealing with a disease. It is not realistic - it is not a documentary... but as a mom of a child who has significant health issues, I appreciated the way the girls deal with those challenges and found myself wishing the hospitals and doctors acted a bit more like the people on the show and tried to make awful stays more fun and interactive. It is a NICE show and they're aren't many of those around anymore. TV can take you out of your sad or depressing trials and this does exactly that."
Alexa & Katie,"I love it, this is exactly what needs to be made",I'm 44 years old and I have been through so much since the age of 7 being back and fourth in the children hospital and beating cancer. Cancer is an illness that people think of as the death illness. I was glad to have someone in my life that made me laugh and have fun with despite my ordeal. I've learned to walk and made it through this. Yes I've seen the worse side of it and people unless you know as a cancer patient you don't know what someone is feeling on the inside. Sometimes the only thing a person needs is a feeling of love and laughter instead of remorse and guilt and friends and family that only see the down side of it. They want their lives to be normal despite cancer. To the creators of this show great job. Having a great friend through this is great someone whose their to make you laugh when you want to cry someone whose there when you want to give up. So once again if you don't have it you shouldn't comment negative on this. Until you live the life you don't know anything.
Alexa & Katie,Very Cute,Comentario no disponible
Alexa & Katie,Enjoyed it!,"Binged watched it via Netflix,in two days. Kept my attention,good storylines & characters. Worth checking out,if you haven't yet."
Alexa & Katie,Cute show,News flash people..this is not a reality show!! Maybe it's not entirely accurate but that would be depressing and somewhat scary not a cute sitcom for young people which it is!
Alexa & Katie,"Funny, but not an accurate portrayal of cancer","My teenage daughter had cancer, and she is almost one year post treatment. This show is funny, and has some great things about it, but it doesn't accurately show what it's like for a kid to have cancer. For instance, a cancer patient has a port, they don't get iv's Every time they receive chemo. They have to wear a mask when they go out into crowded places because their immune system is so low. They are very weak from the chemo. Too weak to run around, jump up and down, attend school with as much energy as Alexa, etc. they don't need to be told to take naps. They beg to take naps. My daughter carried a blanket around with her at all times and laid down every chance she could. Cancer patients require blood transfusions, hospital stays because of infections, constant doctors visits, and lots of sleep. This show makes it look easy. My daughter tried to watch it and she couldn't even finish the season because it bothered her so much. All of her ""friends"" left her. She couldn't go to school. And she has no energy at all. Her experience was the total opposite of this. I just wish tv shows and movies would actually get it right."
Alexa & Katie,Funny and insightful,"I love that this show takes something like cancer that is so hard on families and shows how someone can still be strong and happy despite what she is going through. The character Alexa is written wonderfully. They have a great balance between the teenage drama and the sick patient. Katie provides great comic relief. As someone who has lost a few close friends to cancer and other ailments its nice to see shows that show positive characters just doing their best to survive and make the best our of bad circumstances, even throwing in the struggle of a single mom. This show definitely takes the motto ""live, love, laugh"" to heart."
Alexa & Katie,Its nothing we havn't seen before but its not bad,"The show definitely has it moments. The jokes are predictive and sometimes a little ""childish"" but it is a kids/teenshow after all. You could easily catch something similar on Nickelodeon or Disney Channel but i did find myself enjoying the show after a few episodes. The acting isn't bad, the actors do their job very well. I would say: give this show a try on a lazy Sunday when you're caught up with all your other tv shows. You might just like it, who knows?"
Alexa & Katie,Inspiring,This show was amazing it really inspired children to really think more about cancer 10/10 great job but there is a cliffhanger at the end and I can't wait to watch it!!!
Alexa & Katie,Standard fare...,Comentario no disponible
Alexa & Katie,Insult,"I am 16, got diagnosed with brain cancer about 5 months ago, find this show to be insulting. There is nothing realistic about this show and undermines the actual trouble cancer patients go through.This show not only misrepresents cancer but suggests that cancer patients only act in lashes of anger and are in constant need of distraction. Tv producers should stick to what they know. I don't think they thought cancer patients would be well enough to actually watch this show looking for something to relate to. instead of finding something to relate to I find myself yet again misunderstood and being mocked by girls in bald caps."
Alexa & Katie,I really enjoyed it even as an adult,Comentario no disponible
Alexa & Katie,As good as I thought,"Alexa and Katie is a Netflix series but it reminded me of Disney. I had my doubts after watching the first trailer, but I gave it a chance because I've seen movies and series of Paris Berelc and Jack Griffo.

The series is about a girl recovering from cancer that lives her life at the most positive way along with her best friend and her really supportive family. It's a great comedy despite the main topic.

It didn't have anything bad for me. I loved it, I watched all the episodes at once."
Alexa & Katie,Good attempt.,"The show has its moments. The actors are great.

But as someone who knew a cancer patient, it left some realistic elements out.

Like fatigue to the point of being bed ridden. Memory loss. Meeting others that were like herself. I understand that this is suppose to be from a teens POV but even then a real opinion would have been great to have to base the show off of.

I'm hoping that the episodes get better."
Alexa & Katie,Character Changes Needed,"The reason I like this show is because of Katie. She really understands the awkwardness of high school. She's very likable and her antics are great! Also I like Alexa's mom, I think Tiffany does a great job portraying the worried mom.

The other characters COULD be likable but just need some depth. The worst of the bunch is Alexa's dad and Katie's mom. They come across as uncaring about anything but sports. Alexa's brother and Katie's brother seem to have no relationship with their sisters. AGAIN if they can work on the character developments I think it has the potential to be amazing!"
Alexa & Katie,I'm in love,This is a really good family show. The writers really did a great job on hooking me. I can't wait until season 2.
Alexa & Katie,Asian girl is awful,"There are some interesting things in the show, that I would summarize by saying that if you removed the main actress you would actually end up with a good show. This alleged cancer girl is annoying at all levels, including when she sings during the credits. She is loud and stupid and brings nothing good to the show. On the other hand, all the rest of the cast is quite good and funny to watch."
Alexa & Katie,Loved it!,"I was a little skeptical at first, but Alexa and Katie is an amazing tv show! For someone who has never had cancer, or been close to anyone who has had to deal with long term cancer, I found it really helpful in understanding that kind of life. It also helped me see that having cancer doesn't change someone, and that they are still normal people. I loved the characters, and although there were some very stereotypical, overused traits and scenes, but all in all they added to the shows quality, and made me love it even more. Amazing tv show, and I hope that there is a season 2! (Also Alexa is the one with cancer, not Katie @amanda2332332)"
Alexa & Katie,Show lacks energy...,"This show tries it's best to be funny and meaningful but as you watch you can feel the awkwardness and lack of energy from the actors and the ""audience."" The show tries to follow positive messaging which is hit or miss depending on your experience related to such messages. The two stars are alright with their acting skills but even then it's quite sub par to the older sitcoms that came before. Boy Meets World, Family Matters, Fresh Prince, Sam and Kat, Liv and Maddie you name it those shows are far and away better than this one. Supporting actors are extremely forgettable or stupid aka the males in this show so there's that issue also."
Alexa & Katie,Don't think as a documentary,"Its totally amazing. I love the story and this is a long series. It is different from other series. It is about a 1 year old girl having cancer. It has a great plot and the acting is very good especially by the actor playing Alexa.

Katie also is good .Alexa's parents have a funny role. The first season is good but the rest are amazing and worth watching but if you skip the first season the rest will make completely no sence. It has a great sence of humor. In one episode they showed the flashback of when Alexa's cancer got serious and the actor playing Alexa pictured it so perfectly it felt like she really had cancer. It is not a sad story like she has cancer everything is sad people are crying,no not at all they didn't show the time period of Alexa having cancer. The first episode started when Alexa was in the last recovery day. So no sad stuff. It is worth watching very good and its highly recommended."
Alexa & Katie,Sweet show,Feel good for young teenagers. A bit predictable. Good if you nerd cheering up.
Alexa & Katie,Left Feeling Unsatisfied,"As I watch the ""Alexa & Katie"" tv show I was highly disappointed. I having been through childhood cancer in my past. So I was more than excited to watch this and I kept watching hoping to see the episodes when they bright light to the real situations of cancer... but every episode further I just kept being let down. When do they show that Katie can't eat foods like normal because her taste will change? When does Katie have the worst symptoms from her Chemo therapy? When does Katie get chronic fatigue? When does Katie get to go to cancer for kid events? When does Katie become bed ridden? When does Katie have a friend in the Hospital possibly not make it? When does Katie have memory problems? When, when, when!?

I was so upset and left unsatisfied, I was waiting for those real moments and the heart connecting monologues. Instead we got excuses why Katie is so normal... and why she never shows being sick through her cancer and treatment. It can still be comic relief and light hearted, we just need a realistic story to relate too. I can't relate to this at all and I had Leukemia as a child in middle school and recovering in high school. I've seen a co-worker go to work with chronic Leukemia.

To me it feels who ever is writing this and directing this, has not one single clue or idea about cancer and how kids go through it and I am left so unsatisfied. I thought maybe for once someone could show others how to understand those who went threw cancer... instead they covered it up with a false understanding and that hurts the cancer community and those going threw it. Now a days too many people base understandings threw shows and movies, so stop and rewind and fix this please if you are making a season 2."

Blue Exorcist,you wont get bored,"This is my first review and this is the third anime i watched after death note and code geass. In comparison to them i know this is not up to their level but i enjoyed it a lot and i was so shocked to see that no one wrote a review on it yet. i never got bored watching this soap, every one of the 25 episodes are interesting unlike death note and code geass where due the impact of the previous episodes i got bored in middle episodes which are a little bit slow but they again caught the momentum and ended beautifully although i dint like the ending of code geass or i would say its inconclusive. But with blue exorcist its not like that it got better and better by each episode.

one of the main reason i liked it is that it made me nostalgic for harry potter. there are a lot of things in this soap which are identical to harry potter like the school rin attends which is so identical to Hogwarts and classes and teachers are also so identical to hogwarts. It teaches about friendship like potter and teaches that group effort is always superior to solo effort.

It has got all elements which one may look for in a good anime such as action, fantasy, comedy, drama and a little bit romance. usually i don't like comedy in anime as they some times over react to normal situations to induce comedy and it kills the scene some times but comedy in this soap is appropriate and perfectly placed. They tried avoiding comedy in serious scenes which is good for that reason every scene played well. I stopped watching fairy tale and full metal brotherhood due to such type of comedy. i was surprised to see that they stopped this show after only 1 season. I hope they reprise this how as soon as possible, i am waiting for the sequel so eagerly.

last word: you will never regret watching this show because i didn't"
Blue Exorcist,"A Unique Idea, betwixt some predictable tropes.","Season 1 (2011): When an action anime meets Christianity this happens. It's a really unique idea and it has some good scenes and sequences. I thought it could have done better at times and some parts were pretty predictable, but that's to be expected seeing as all the characters are high school age.

There's something for everyone to get out of it, however I wouldn't show it to someone who's never seen anime."
Blue Exorcist,"Emotions are for chumps, Demons speak with hellfire.... and hugs","The first two episodes are pretty good and quite intense. It was the kind of thing I would expect to scar people for a long time, if it happened to them. However the main character, Rin, doesn't seem to phased by it and neither should you, because it doesn't remain that intense. Allot of the time it is quite light hearted and hugs solve allot of problems.

Generally the series is very short and as such all of the character's emotional turmoil is dealt with pretty quickly. In fact the main characters main emotions are righteous anger and puppy mode, which you might not realize you will love but you probably will. This doesn't mean there aren't any emotions, just don't expect characters to be discussing their feelings that much. The main struggles characters face are to do with friendship, how they deal with their past and finally understanding others. A good portion of the show is like a high school drama, all about making friends, passing tests and keeping secrets.

The end of the show really speeds up, this is because the anime overtook the manga and rushed to the end. It is not as bad as other endings that are like that but there are some things that are skipped and don't seem to the same.For example I feel weird saying Satan is not such a bad guy.

The demons are appropriately horrifying, excluding ones you are supposed to like. They look like they are part monkey and wag their tales like puppies. If you are watching subtitles hope they aren't in yellow like mine were because allot of the floors are yellowy. The English dub is fine except for the first two episodes where the voice acting is just less intense than what's going on.

In summary I liked it, I liked the characters, they were all pretty bad arse but still lovable. The premise and events were interesting and I thought about them a bit, but I was left thinking some things should have been explored more. Some things were a little freaky but there was plenty of cuteness too."
Blue Exorcist,Thumbs up for Blue Exorcist!,"Probably one of the best shows I have ever seen. I watched it because of recommendation from a friend. Finished the whole series after I watched every single episode in a row. Every question you could ask was answered. The only one I have is ""what do I do now?"" You become instantly attached to Rin and Yukio and every main character. The final episode is very fulfilling and does not leave you angry that the creators left something out. It only leaves you yearning for more. Blue Exorcist epitomizes everyone's desire for adventure, strength, and acceptance, and that's why people of every genre could enjoy Blue Exorcist. If you haven't seen a single episode, I recommend giving the first couple episodes a try. And once you start, you won't be able to stop. Go watch it! Right now!"
Blue Exorcist,What a Delightful Series,"On paper, this show appears to be a number of clichés of the supernatural anime subgenre. Youths going to an exorcist academy to fight demons and the drama and hijinks that occur along the way. 9/10 times I find that type of anime to be very standard and underwhelming, but this series seemed to execute those cliche's in a manner that made this series surprisingly engaging.

I have a family member who went through film school who has told me that you can have the most derived and clichéd story, but it still can be superb, it's all about the execution.

Now this series was not even close to the stand out originality of series such as Cowboy Beebop, Attack on Titan, Trigun, and such but it stands on its own because of an engaging cast of characters, especially the two main characters. The twins.

This series may not go into the depth of some of the above mentioned series but it has great themes of friendship, being an outcast, family and such.

And I'm not much of a fan of the chibi thing, and it didn't at all get on my nerves or unnecessarily break from the drama as I've found in other shonen series with chibi.

Overall, not one of the top animes out there but highly recommend watching for any anime fans out there."
Blue Exorcist,"An entertaining series, despite being predictable","I have to admit that I did find this show ok. The plot was pretty much your typical shonun jump series. A boy who is a half demon wants to become an exorcist and take down satin. Together with his brother, they enroll into a excorist school and learn the ropes of being an excorist. I have seen this type of story FAR too many times. But I feel like it is done quite well. The characters are enjoyable and charming, the animation is pretty good and the story is ok. I feel like the final few episodes felt a bit too rushed, but there is a reason. It dis suprise ke when I found out why the laet few episodes were rushed, but I will explain it in my Kyoto Saga review. This was the first anime in a long, LONG time were I actually watched the dub firsr. I do have mixed feelings with it, but not what yoy are thinking. Firsr off, I cannot stand any of the male voice acting, especially the really old characters. Rim's voice actor I think was the guy who voiced Eren Yeager in Attack on Titan and thought he sounded good. The only male character who sounded really good was Yukio. That voice acting waa one of the best male voice actors I have heard in a while. But that's it, all the male's sound AWFUL. On the other hand, all the female characters sound AMAZING, which is ironic. So, all in all, a pretty sub standard show, but if you are getting into anime for the first time, give thos show a watch."
Blue Exorcist,Smasher of Expectations,"I first encountered this a few years back when I read a few volumes of the manga but eventually fell off track with the books as a whole, however I can happily say I'm glad I came back to this series. With this, the sequel film and follow up series ""The Kyoto Saga"" now available on Netflix I've decided to power through them and boy did I make the right choice! This show was truly a fantastic watch and easily up there with some of the best anime I've seen of all time. Fantastic character, deep and thoroughly established world, and an amazing spectacle/scale as the series unfolds it's a masterpiece to be honest. Apparently deviating off book much like Game of Thrones the handover is seemless and has a fitting end after setting the stakes at a ridiculous level, there's so much to say I could be here all day so I'll round it off by saying a few things, note that the final 6/7 episodes are discounted when watching the Kyoto Saga, secondly and finally definitely give this a watch"
Blue Exorcist,Could have made better,It had some potential but wasted. The MC is dumb. Big dialogs but doesn't give the vibe.
Blue Exorcist,An awesome new supernatural anime series to watch,"I'm always on the lookout for new supernatural anime to watch or manga to read. I had stumbled across images for this series and was intrigued. I had come across the original manga, and I thought it was really awesome. I had read up to volume seven. Of course, I think both manga and anime series are awesome too.

It has been a long while since I finished Season One on Netflix, but all I could remember is this: Rin and Yukio Okumura are twin boys raised in a monastery by Shiro Fujimoto, a priest exorcist. Demons attack the monastery, and Satan himself takes possession of Fujimoto. Rin discovers that he and his brother are actually Satan's half-blooded sons. Then Fujimoto killed himself. So fueled by vengeance, Rin decides to become an exorcist himself to defeat Satan, and he enrolls in a cram school along with other would-be exorcists, with Yukio as their professor.

You know, I despise Izumo Kamiki for being a complete jerk and humiliating Shiemi Moriyama (the main heroine). Additionally, I believed that Noriko Paku, Izumo's lone friend, had left the school because she wasn't content with just keeping up and was upset with Izumo for how she handled Shiemi, even if the girl only desired their friendship.

All in all, I love every bit of this awesome TV series, and I wish it was on North American DVD."
Blue Exorcist,"Dumb, yet entertaining.","This series is very entertaining. There is a lot of action and interesting concepts. There are a lot of scenes and episodes that are really dumb, but I just find it funny. I know that a lot of people would get frustrated to sit though 5 minutes of backstory for a cat in a semi-filler episode, but I just laugh through it. The animation is pretty good for the most part, and there is a lot of attention to continuity. The story has a lot of plot holes and continuity errors, but the animation is great. I can see how a lot of stuff in this series would make people annoyed, but I just find it funny. Even if you don't like every episode, this show is really entertaining. I would recommend this series."
Blue Exorcist,A Great Mix of Horror and Comedy,"I'll be honest, finding a new anime to watch has always been hard for me. Starting a new anime is like getting into a hot tub, if you jump in too quickly, chances you'll sprint out as quickly as you hopped in. But if you slowly ease yourself in, you'll adjust to it and enjoy the experience. That's how it was when I started watching Blue Exorcist. As a fan of Soul Eater, I enjoy anime that can take themselves seriously, but know when to joke around, and are not heavy on nudity and swearing. And Blue Exorcist fits the bill. I like the characters, I like the set up. I only have two questions. 1: How can some exorcists summon demons when exorcists and demons are suppose to be enemies? And 2: Why do so many anime take place at schools? There's this one, Soul Eater, Kill la Kill, Ouran Host Club, etc. Anyway, I still enjoy this anime, and I highly recommend it if you loved Soul Eater."
Blue Exorcist,"Nothing super deep, but fun to watch","Blue Exorcist isn't really that spectacular and it has several problems, but that does not mean it is a terrible watch. You'll enjoy yourself while watching it, there just isn't, much more than pure entertainment. If you're okay with that then, you'll enjoy this show then I recommend it. If you don't like that, then don't watch it. Now on to the problems: I never felt like any of our characters really grew in their abilities throughout the show. In all honesty I felt their skill level was exactly the same from when they were fighting basic demons all the way to when they're fighting Satan. It might be forgivable for the side characters to not show that much growth as the main character is much more important, but our main character, Rin Okumura, doesn't show any advancement either, and I take serious issue with that. Next problem is the pacing. I think they tried to condense too much content onto too few episodes, which makes me wish there were about 50 episodes rather than 25. Towards the end things get really rushed. It's like one second everyone is still basically trainees then they're fighting the most powerful demon out there. I would have liked it to slow down and take its time. As I said before though, it does offer up a pretty decent dose of pure entertainment, so watch it if you have nothing better to watch. 6.8/10"

Blue Exorcist,Amazing!!!,Really good. I love the plot and I wished there was another season.
Blue Exorcist,Related Anime's and more,I personally found this show very diverse covering various anime types. I have watched this and can say that they are really really good.
Blue Exorcist,Holds up over time!,"I watched this first back in high school, and re-watching however many years later, it's still a super fun series. Filler episodes don't feel like filler, and while the end of the season is kinda rushed, it's still a fun and dramatic wrap-up."
Blue Exorcist,Fun but not pretty,I can say this cause I'm a dedicated anime fan when it comes to viewing this kind of sector of entertainment i just wish it could end but not disappointing in a bad way just not cut out to be among the worthy series or there.
Blue Exorcist,Blue Exorcist Review,"Blue exorcist is an anime full of laughs and excitement. It is very well animated and wrote. The issue I have is that it is the same old plot of ""guy discovering powers to save the world."" But over all it is quite enjoyable. I recommend this for legit fans of anime and people who love comedy. I give it a 8/10."

Blue Exorcist,One of the best,"This was my second anime after Seven Deadly Sins. That was back in 2018. I had fallen in loved with it but hated the ending because it meant there was only one season. I fell in love with every character and plot. However, you need to only watch it until about the end of episode 15 or 16. There is a second series (season two on Netflix) that is true to the manga."
Blue Exorcist,Best action anime.,"Some people say its messed up because it is mixing katholism and anime but i think thats quite ridiculous because i dont remember anyone forbiding churches in anime shows... The point is that its a really nice anime , both the plot and the quality of the show is good and it can probably be considered one of the best unique ideas in anime series. Also dont forget that every character in the series has a decent development which is something really rare to see in most anime."
Blue Exorcist,"Solid feel good anime, recommend if u can't find anything else to watch","This anime will keep you entertained, it has a great storyline and makes you feel good. I highly recommend it if you are looking for magic or shounen animes...."
Happy as Lazzaro,A good one!,"Lazzaro is a symbolic character in this Film. With the eyes of an innocent, kindhearted child he connects two worlds-two parts of the story. Lives of enslaves tabaco growers are difficult, manual labor is hard, food is scarce and living arrangements are appalling. Yet, their lives are socially structured, they maintain cultural traditions, live in a beautiful natural environment, eat "" real"" bread, drink real wine, take care of each other and maintain good spirit. What happens next is heart wrenching, but reflective of today's reality. Good intention pave a road to hell they say. Chips for a meal anyone?"

Happy as Lazzaro,A Masterpiece!,"What is wrong with us? Where is innocence and compassion? Is there any good left in this world? Lazzaro represents the incarnation of kindness itself. It is hearthbreaking to see that ""Lazzaros"" have very little space in this world, and that they are mostly not welcome. This movie will touch deeply the people who are still able to cry when confronted with all the atrocities, and injustices we commit to each other day by day. Most of all, it will touch whoever feels the need to improve in terms of humanity, sensibility and compassion even knowing that greater and darker forces overwhelm mankind.

I deeply recommend everyone this experience."
Happy as Lazzaro,Rohrwacher's fantastic fable about the Wolf at the door,"Loosely inspired by a true story of Italian farmers who were forced into near sharecropper conditions by the De Luna family in an isolated village, Alice Rohrwacher's HAPPY AS LAZZARO takes a fantastical approach to the material. The early scenes of the workers toiling to get by in the hamlet is, like Rohrwacher's previous THE WONDERS (bee farmers), full of attention to detail - both visually and aurally (the sounds of the wind and the distant howls of wild animals become their own soundtrack). The screenplay (a winner at Cannes) becomes a fable as it moves along. The peasants eventually settle into the city - but, their lives at the bottom of the run continue. A hearty band, led by Antonia (a superb Alba Rohrwacher, the Director's sister) struggles to survive in the modern world. As fate would have it, they cross paths with the remnants of the De Luna clan. Throughout all this, is Lazzaro (Adriano Tardiolo). A sort of benighted Forrest Gump figure, Lazzaro drifts among the characters blissfully unaware of the darkness around him. Rohrwacher's fantasy elements (THE WONDERS also had a few), gives the film (shot on 16mm) a different perspective. The symbolism doesn't always fully connect, but, you never doubt that her vision isn't firmly conceived. One thought becomes clear and lingers in the mind: The wolf may be at the door, but, who is the wolf?"
Happy as Lazzaro,Homo Homini Lupus?,"Tender, poetic, philosophical, allegorical tale of control and exploitation and funnily enough the picture of the absurd yet the-truest-that-I've-ever-seen state of contentment. The sheer atrocities of manipulation and shameless discrimination of the fellow earthlings is heart-wrenching and tough to watch yet the poetic whiff that imbues it draws an overwhelming feeling of self-realization and utter admiration and gratitude towards the author of this Film-classic that questions the destiny of innocence in the Contemporary world."
Happy as Lazzaro,Too Obtuse,"""Happy as Lazzaro"" feels like a parable with hints of magical realism, and the whole thing was just a bit too obtuse for me to fully enjoy.

There are themes of social repression, economic exploitation, and mankind's abandonment of nature for the more soulless landscapes of urban industrialization, all of which are certainly relevant to the world in which we live. But I found myself hard pressed to feel involved in any of it as explored by this film. Lazzaro is more an idea than an actual character, and I think one of the reasons he's offered as such a blank slate is so that the audience can project on to him whatever they want. I imagine there will be all sorts of different interpretations of this film, who Lazzaro is, and what it is he's meant to signify. I can and have expended that kind of mental energy on answering questions in other movies, and usually enjoy it very much, but I have to feel like the questions are going to be worth answering before I can get my head in that zone, and I didn't with this movie.

Happy as Lazzaro,odd yet beautiful film,"The first act of the Italian film Happy As Lazzaro focuses on naïve, worker-bee Lazzaro, an all-around good-guy who's as gullible as Charlie Brown. He, along with his fellow working community, is exploited by a tobacco heiress as unwitting sharecroppers. Unfortunately, further references to Steve Martin's The Jerk stop there. Lazzaro falls into a unique, albeit one-sided, friendship with the heiress' son, Tancredi, Tancredi, of course, is a bored dreamer who has everything; Lazzaro's a dreamer of the opposite order. While lyrics from folk-rockers Moxy Fruvous' ""King of Spain"" might come to mind, a song detailing the switching of identity to alter responsibilities, writer/director Alice Rohrwacher sings a decidedly different art house tune. The film changes tactics and shows a displaced Lazzaro alone in the big city, still trying to appease friends and foes alike with disastrous effects. Good grief.

Happy As Lazzaro is gorgeously shot on super 16mm film, which feels like a special treat from 1989. Rohrwacher keeps her dialogue at a minimum trusting Adriano Tardiolo's eyes and body language as the storyteller. The trade off is the loose story wanders as easily as Lazzaro's daydreams. Lazzaro is a likeable round character, yet as the story grows in complexity, he retreats in his innocence. Rohrwacher no doubt deliberately creates this conflict as her morality play grows into a fable, but the ultimate treatment of the character is as unfulfilling as it is sermonizing.

Lazzaro is the analogous common worker, never rewarded for his efforts. He is used, removed, and replaced as often as this tale's format. To tally the scores once again, the 1% have 100, the Dreamers, 0. Maybe nothing has changed since 1989.

Lazzaro may remain happy, but viewers might rather indulge in the Italian scenery."
Happy as Lazzaro,The Tale of Inviolata,"There are some in our lives that exist beyond the scope of time or universally accepted countenance, those like Lazzaro who bear the kindness of a child and the internal strength of an ox. In Alice Rohrwacher junior film Lazzaro Felice (Happy as Lazzaro), the title character develops an unlikely friendship with the heir to a tobacco industry marquis. This same marquis has kept Lazzaro and his kin imprisoned as unpaid workers on a farm isolated from the modern world. The film mesmerizingly drifts between somber and bitter-sweet notes while the tobacco leaves and sway and the sun bakes the earth. Because the work is captured in warm 16mm, the setting feels like a piece of art from a lost age. Every character is real. A pinch is required to remind the viewer that this is not a dream or a production, Lazzaro and his partner in crime Tancredi are flesh and blood. The sound profile's depth compliments Lazzaro Felice's archaic beauty. The score uses music box chiming and staccato piano strikes, both of which echo throughout the Italian hills. Despite the Italian language barrier, one can understand the plot from vocal inflections alone. Lastly, the sound effects are rich. The pitter patter of the wolves' claws over concrete is distinct from the crunch of sand and soil underfoot. Lazzaro Felice is not to be missed. It calls to mind an air of innocence and perseverance in spite of the world. It beckons home the love of youth and family."
Happy as Lazzaro,Aint Them Italians Saints?,"I have read with interest some of the strange interpretations of this movie. The inability to understand what the story this movie conveys is largely down to the lack of awareness of the Catholic faith as its no longer in favour with some due to how the church responded to allegations of abuse. This is a movie about a saint. The main actor bears more than a passing resemblance to Michelangelos David in both facial features and hair. His behaviour is selfless and he turns the other cheek when abused. He is dutiful and never questions authority. He is in short the ideal catholic or rather the ideal that the catholic religion teaches. Religious iconography is all over this movie and there is also a discussion about saints and their demise, the so called shock ending is no shock if you have have ever attended mass. This is not exactly a surprise as this movie is based in a catholic country. The movie is the story about a person who is used as a beast of burden by a group of tobacco workers who are in turn being exploited by the rich, all very biblical. The story is split into two with the first half focusing on the tobacco farm and the second years later in a city setting. There is alot of gentle humour in the movie and it is in part poverty porn, its about the poorest of the poor being exploited by those with better finances. This is also a very catholic idea, that the poor will get to heaven while the rich will not. The story itself is quite simple but is maybe overlong at over two hours. This is a movie which would likely play well to a religious audience who understand where the narrative is coming from. However its in Italian which may limit its reach. Its certainly playing well with the so called educated classes however they appear to be uneducated in the texts of dominant christian religion and interpret this movie as ""magical"" but seem to miss the point. If you enjoyed Being There this is basically a religious version on the same themes, recommended but its not magical its religious."
Happy as Lazzaro,What a waste of time!,"The reviews looked quite promising and so I was looking forward to see the movie... But oh boy, what a waste of time! The first 20 minutes seemed to be interesting but then the nonsense starts, with boring side stories, strange character development until it was not clear anymore what this story was about? Modern day slavery? Friendship? Betrayal? A strange story about a ""saint""? Life struggles of poor people? I did not know by the end. I think the good reviews were written from people who think that a weird and boring story that makes no sense is somehow artsy. It's not. It is just plain nonsense."
Happy as Lazzaro,Happy as Lazzaro Review,"Watched the film at the Palic Film Festival few days ago and i'm still under its influence. Happy as Lazzaro is shot on Super 16mm, lending the film a grainy look that evokes warmth and nostalgia. Wonderful film that wraps its hands around you and with its unusual exotic atmosphere doesn't let go till the end. The acting is briilliant, especially from Adriano Tardiolo, extremley talented actor, hope to see him more in the future. Alice Rohrwacher made a masterpiece and without spoiling anything, I deeply recommend you to see it."
Happy as Lazzaro,Profound - Poetic - Heart-wrenching,"There are some films that change you forever, Happy As Lazzaro is one of them. It is a painfully beautiful film with the socioeconomic insight of Leviathan, the poetic heart of The Shape Of Water and the emotional punch of The Diving Bell & the Butterfly. I saw it last night and it's resonance is still reverberating through my heart and mind. It is so intelligently drawn, steeped in allegory and metaphor that are both an indictment of our worst selves and a reminder of the infinite possibility of our choice to be good, to exercise positive unconditional regard for others. Thank you to Alice Rohrwacher and Tempesta Film for creating this masterpiece. Deeply affecting & not to be missed."
Happy as Lazzaro,Unique and witty film.,Go and experience this without hesitation... You'll be surprised how well crafted it is.
Happy as Lazzaro,Stronger in the first half,"Beginning in the late 1970s, the title character (played by Adrian Tardiolo) is a young man who is good-hearted though naive. He is a among a community of over fifty people who live and work in tobacco fields in rural Italy. They are exploited by a cigarette company owner.

Firstly, a side comment: this is the second recent film from Italy in which the lead actor has a striking resemblance to Justin Trudeau. This also occurred with Timothée Chalamet in ""Call Me By Your Name"" released earlier this year. Okay, enough about superficial fluff and on to the review.

The film's first half is fascinating in its depiction of extreme class differences and how the poor can remain pure in their hearts despite their circumstances. The film-makers succeed in making their point in a way that is not syrupy or manipulative. The second half also fascinates in how it shows how the poor get by in very different circumstances in another location, Adding further intrigue are believable elements of mysticism including the use of a wolf as a spirit animal.

The conclusion does not live up to the earlier potential. It includes a scene in which ""goodness"" is stupidly applied. Further to that is the final scene that is too bizarre and out of place. This is unfortunate as most of the film was quite good. - dbamateurcritic."
Happy as Lazzaro,Beautiful Film,"Very well done, brilliantly exposing human nature, the contrast and capacities of humans to remain compassionate and kind in spite all suffering, or to be mean and greedy. Very creative, with many deep meaningful messages of kindness and compassion, and how rare and unusual those qualities are. Lazzaro's character reminds me of St. Francis of Assisi, and I got a sense that there was a parallel and subtle comparison to St. Francis. Loved this film."
Happy as Lazzaro,Happiness is a state of mind,"Lazzaro Felice (Alice Rohrwacher, 2018) is a tale that causes some strangeness in the first few minutes, but quickly the spirit opens to receive this wonderful cinematic narrative where neorealism and magical realism intersect. From the first sequence, we are taken by a growing curiosity to know what makes that rural community succumb to the marquise's whims. Within this community, the angelic figure of Lazarus emerges, whose naivety and candor quickly touch the spectator, and who are responsible for making Lazarus worthy of the miracle of resurrection. Adriano Tardiolo is the non-actor who perfectly embodies the happiness of simple things, without expecting anything in return, to which the title alludes. In a world where everyone is exploited and exploiters, only Lázaro fulfills the virtue of disinterest."

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: An odd little film that wants to say more than it actually does.

JIM'S REVIEW: Happy as Lazzaro, a parable about working class strife, takes its time telling its story about the rich noble family and their haughty dismissal of the poor servants who work on their tobacco farm. The story takes place in an imaginary town called Inviolata where illegal indentured servitude seems to be the norm. Directed and written by Alice Rohrwacher, the film shows the rural poverty and oppression very well as it weaves its tale about a hard-working peasant named Lazarro (Adriano Tardiolo) who befriends Tancredi, a pampered and spoiled Marquis.

The problem with the screenplay is that Lazarro is a dolt, a good person without much sense or emotion. As written, he is a blank slate, a straight man without a sidekick. Everyone takes advantage of our hero, as does Tancredi who concocts a fake kidnapping scheme to get back at his cruel mother, Alfonsina, the Queen of Cigarettes. He assigns Lazarro the job of being his alleged captor, and his dim-witted foil gratefully accepts this role. As this inane plot spirals out of control and affects the whole village in major ways, so does Ms. Rohrwacher's plot spin out of control and affects the entire movie in major ways too.

Midway through this neo-realistic film, the entire tone changes into an mystical allegory of good vs. evil as the story becomes otherworldly with elements of magic realism involving wolves, stark imagery, time-traveling, odd unexplained events, and a ""forever young"" Lazarro. The two narratives just do not mesh, although I did enjoy the cleverness of second act reveal more than the heavy-handedness in the earlier segments.

Happy as Lazarro is an interesting venture, with its angelic title character playing an Italian Forest Gump figure whose sheer presence acts as a catalyst for everyone else involved. But the film never builds to an emotional and satisfying conclusion. It just goes about its meandering ways and celebrates its oddness, long past its due."
Happy as Lazzaro,"If you are just looking for an entertaining film, look elsewhere.","The critics love this film. Me? I want that two hours of my life back.

An hour into the film, nothing has happened and you have paid so much with your boredom that you feel obligated to watch further. It surely must have some kind of payoff since the critics praise this film, surely it must be worthwhile, surely SOMETHING is going to happen.

It doesn't. There is no payoff. At the end you are searching for something good about this film so you can justify the time spent watching and not feel like you were just swindled. But sometimes, you are just swindled.

Boring, depressing and pointless. Seriously, don't bother with this film."

Haters Back Off,On Episode 6... Can't Finish,"Meant to wait longer before writing this review but I just had to do it right now instead. I had planned to watch the entire first season (I hear there will be a second and I can't can't can't can't can't believe it) first, but I couldn't possibly sit through one more single minute of this show.

I don't love or hate the YouTube videos but the idea of taking those short clips of a really annoying character and stretching it out to a half hour series is just brain numbingly awful. Who had that bright idea?

The sister is a decent actor and the uncle causes a couple laughs as does Angela from The Office fame (who is Miranda's mom).

The writing is painfully awful to sit through with the jokes incredibly unfunny and predictable. Anyone who does not see these jokes coming from a mile away must be blind and never experienced a single sitcom before. Boring, boring, boring.

The worst part of the show though is the lead character of Miranda. The people around her are all unbelievable (except the sister) and stupid but she is the worst one of all. The whiny voice and complete lack of singing talent are of course planned but just because you write something to be intentionally bad does not somehow make it good... it's still awful to sit through!

This is so bad I can't even tell for sure if this is supposed to be a comedy or a drama or a statement about modern YouTube ""stars""... it is very sad that this person is making a lot of money by being a terrible actress who pretends to sing badly, standing out as the worst person in a cast of unlikable, uninteresting characters.

Netflix doesn't make too many bad mistakes but this is one of them. No season two please. Make something else instead."
Haters Back Off,Nothing like I was expecting!,"Being a fan of her YouTube channel, I was looking forward to watching ""Haters Back Off."" Since the character itself is a parody, I was expecting a really cheesy comedy. The humor and family dynamic strongly reminds me of Napoleon Dynamite, giving off that same sense of awkwardness and struggle to be noticed and accepted by others. As the series progresses, it transforms into a dramatic comedy, creating much more depth with each character's personal struggles. There were many times where I found myself laughing only to be tearing up minutes later, because there is a realness to the show that has never been offered through Miranda's actual YouTube channel. I can understand that some fans may not have enjoyed the show as much as her channel, because Miranda's character is portrayed a bit differently. Even though she may come across more selfish or clueless with her actions, I think in order for this show to have worked Colleen needed to portray her in a more realistic way. Miranda has always been extremely confident of herself, and this is the first time we get to see how her behavior affects the few loved ones she has. I really enjoyed the realness that this show brought. Great job with the casting also, all of the actors did a really phenomenal job. I hope to hear about a Season 2 in the works someday, I would love to see how the story continues! Would highly recommend!!"
Haters Back Off,Awful,"Not funny for a comedy, just plain not good if it's a drama. The lead character is incredibly annoying and I get they're trying to play it off as ""no we're being annoying on purpose to be funny"" but it just doesn't work, it's just an annoying and unlikable and unfunny person. The other actors are mostly terrible as well. The writing and jokes are terrible. Nothing worth watching and I saw the entire first season. I guess apparently there's a season two? Hopefully it is better but I will not be watching. Awful!"
Haters Back Off,Haters what's the problem??,"After reading the user reviews I didn't hold much hope for this but I must say I was pleasantly surprised, some really funny stuff some not so funny stuff but all in all I enjoyed it. I feel as though it has a somewhat of a Napoleon Dynamite feel to it....though let me add I'm not saying it is on that level but I see some similarities. I'd gives a comedic look at youths today who crave social media attention and how the rest of society makes you aware very quickly how they feel about you. It tries to send a strong message with the comedy aspect, if you want something not to taxing and an easy to watch I'd give it a thumbs up just don't expect to see the greatest thing ever but it will make you giggle."

Haters Back Off,The mockumentary orgins of MirandaSings.,"A mocukentary of the orgins of Miranda sings, the alter ego of youtuber College Balanger a sureal parody of the hubris that embodies the overly serious youtube stars... Balenger created Miranda from inspiration of her narcissistic college mates, and created a caricature of them....."
Haters Back Off,Haters Justified,"This is the worst Netlfix show I have ever seen. Not only would I ask you to never waste a second of your time on it, but I also would like Netflix to remove it immediately.

It is the worst written and bland show I have ever seen. There is absolutely nothing in the show worth commenting on. This show seems to be trying to channel Napoleon Dynamite. If someone recorded random people doing Napoleon Dynamite impressions, it would actually be better than this script and the terrible actors.

The absolute worst part is the uncle. He sucks the life out of anything that might have been redeemable. Its interesting to note that the awkward uncle bit is stolen straight from Napoleon Dynamite, except that he should die in a gratuitously violent long lasting death so we could feel proper resolution after the torture of watching him.

My only wish is that you write a review and send this trash to the pits of review hell. This does not deserve anything more than a single star. This is the ""fake news"" of Netflix shows.

My only regret is that I gave it a chance and watched more than a single episode. My only wish is that I could remove it from my watch history and also my brain via lobotomy.

The fact that someone was paid to write this, and that someone still produced the show after reading the script, and that anyone involved was paid at all is so depressing that I'm probably going to call a suicide hotline once I finish this review. Please never let these people create anything ever again. It is unconscionable."
Haters Back Off,Obnoxious,"Obnoxious, could barely stand 5 minutes of it. It is one thing to have an obnoxious annoying character in an ensemble but this has multiple intentionally annoying characters. The main character, Miranda, is so whiny that I can not accurately pin point what age she is meant to be playing. The premise had potential but it missed the mark completely."
Haters Back Off,It is so hilarious that all the reviews are haters,Brilliant meta-comedy if there is such a thing. Same people who hate Andy Kaufman.
Haters Back Off,"Not my thing, but very impressive for a Youtube show","(This review is based off the first episode of Season 1. If it gets better after that, I would not know)

When I first heard that Miranda Sings was picked up by Netflix, I was very surprised, especially since most people on Youtube went and made Youtube Red shows. So I was wondering what exactly made Haters Back Off different from the other shows based on Youtubers.

Haters Back Off is created by and stars Colleen Ballinger as her famous character Miranda Sings. I'm not a fan of her, but I do know that she's essentially a parody of those overly pretentious cover singer artists that Youtube is full of. Her gimmick is that she wears really bright red lipstick, and sings badly. This show, however, gives her character a little more depth, by adding a quirky dysfunctional family. There's the uncle who is just as crazy as Miranda, her mother who knows Miranda is crazy, but enables her behaviour, and her sane younger sister, who is just trying to live a normal life.

The comedy isn't really my thing, as the humour is based around Miranda being incredibly unlikeable and narcissistic as she pursues her dream of being a star. She is awful, but nobody wants to tell her that, so they let her do whatever she wants to do, with little to no repercussion. The fact that her (in universe) career isn't picking up is ignored by her and her uncle, as a sign that 'everyone else is wrong', hence the title of the show.

One thing this show has over other shows based off Youtubers is the production value. This legit looks like a show on par with many other Netflix Originals. It's something that Youtube Red originals haven't quite replicated, as their shows almost universally have that bland Reality TV look to them. Haters Back Off at the very least has a decent budget and crew behind it. The acting is also really good. Miranda is (debatably) the worst actor, but since she's playing an exaggerated character, that she has done well over and over again, perhaps I'm just reading into it too much. The other actors, who are undoubtedly professionals, play their (much more subtle) roles very well. No complaints there.

So if you're into the character of Miranda Sings, or are interested in a comedy show with a crazy protagonist, give this a shot. For myself, there are other shows I would rather watch."
Haters Back Off,Over-hyped.,"I've never really been a huge fan of MirandaSings or Colleen. Not because she's a bad person or anything, it's just that her stuff has never really been my cup of tea. When I heard about this show coming out on Netflix, I decided to look forward to this show with an open mind.

Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. You can only watch an annoying character be obnoxious before it actually starts to annoy you for so long, let alone eight 30-min episodes. Watching the way too dysfunctional and messed up family fall apart even more just makes it awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Basically, it feels like watching an annoying kid in your school yelling at and arguing with her parents in the school parking lot for too long. The only good things I can say is that Colleen did a pretty good job playing her part as Miranda (which is pretty much expected as she plays the role all the time). The writing was also better than expected. I guess the point I'm trying to get across is that it could've been worse, and thankfully it wasn't.

Also, who is the target demographic of this show? I know most of Miranda's fans are probably 12 year old girls or something, so the rating of TV-14 just cut off a lot of potential viewers. I don't know, maybe I'm just judging the situation wrong. Besides that, most of the audience for this show are probably already fans of Miranda, so they'll just mindlessly watch and ""enjoy"" this show just because of that fact that it's a show with Miranda as the main character, without thinking about what the actual content is.

Overall, this show is basically Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous, except Zach has been replaced with a self-obsessed brat with a voice that gets old after a while with a creepy uncle. And minus the comedy. Didn't really know what I was expecting."

Haters Back Off,Colleen Ballinger has brought Miranda to TV in the most amazing way!,"Miranda Sings has always made me laugh when watching her on YouTube. I have been waiting for this show since Colleen told us all about it on her channel.

It is great to finally see Miranda's family and their life before Miranda rose to fame. The comical elements each character has is outstandingly acted and almost every line they say is hilarious.

Although it does take at least the first episode to get into the show, it is 100% worth it afterwards.

The best way to describe this show is awkwardly-hilarious. If you enjoy a good laugh, then this show is a must-watch for you. It really is fun for all the family."
Haters Back Off,I knew the reviews would be like this on here lol,"If you click on a series like this obviously you are looking for something silly and something that will make you laugh. If you didn't click on this expecting something else this is exactly the show you're looking for.

I honestly didn't think it was going to be as good as it was, it had me giggling and had some great life lessons. If you're looking for something you don't have to take serious give this a try. I had to write this with all the crazy low reviews."
Haters Back Off,"Cringey, gross, wannabe Napoleon Dynamite","Colleen Ballinger is gross and a creep and this really comes through in her acting and writing for this hot garbage of a show. I cannot believe Netflix approved this or that it is rated G by any stretch of the imagination. The incestuous and pervy uncle character is disgusting and the show is mind-numbing. There are maybe two good jokes in the whole series and the rest is just an unfunny mess. The potty and lowbrow humor that's aimed at kids has no place next to the inappropriate and adult jokes, innuendos, and scenarios. Each has a time and place but it in a show aimed at a child audience. Colleen has proven herself to be a disgusting person and Netflix needs to remove this atrocity from its platform."

Haters Back Off,Good if you don't take TV too seriously!,"By no means is this ever going to be listed up there with the best, but I think too many reviews here are from the wrong kind of people! Of course this isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but the beauty of it is - it's not trying to be. I thing Coleen Ballinger does a fantastic job of portraying a completely talentless performer, but I truly believe the stand-out performance is from Steve Little as Uncle Jim."
Haters Back Off,Its SOOO BADDD,Dont watch it if u value your time It's so boring and has no story
El Chapo,The show is too real (I guess that is good for a TV show),"Viewers need to understand that the things they are watching are mostly real. The ''Emes'' are the Zetas. The Bernal Leyda brothers are the Beltrán Leyva. The Amendaños are the Arellano Félix. And so on. Even Conrado Sol seems to be Genaro García Luna.

The murder of a cardinal in Guadalajara was real. The massacres by the Zetas on innocent people are real. The whole war under president Calderón is real. Basically, every major character and event. Bear that in mind all the time.

Paz para México."
El Chapo,Complete 3 season 35 episodes review !!!,"If one compares ""El Chapo"" head on along with big budget and runaway hits like the Narcos and Narcos: Mexico, El Chapo despite its lower budget and an all Mexican production does very well to hold on its own on several fronts and is in fact is better than Narcos and Narcos: Mexico on certain segments. The biggest strength of El Chapo lies is its solid writing, a screenplay that never deviates even one bit from its storyline whatsoever.

The first season is rock solid and remains totally focused on the raise of Joaquin Guzman. The second season focuses on his taking control of as ""The Boss"" and the turf wars plaguing within and among the other cartels. The third mainly focuses on a hide and seek game with the government forces and his ultimate arrest. All three seasons also enlightens and gives us great insights on the political system and the corruption that had engulfed Mexico over the decades. Yes, there are several cheesy scenes in second and third seasons on several occasions but the show comes back strongly soon enough and erases the silly effect in our heads with some brilliant follow up scenes every time.

Cinematography is very good right throughout the series and excels in stunt sequences, in fact stunt sequences are a mixed bag owing to a low budget but the DOP covers much of budget concerns with his excellent craft. As said earlier the strongest suit of El Chapo is its screenplay that never deviates from the original storyline, though there are several characters in the series, excellent screenplay makes it very easy to remember them. Editing is excellent as there are almost zero scenes that is not required for the storyline, unlike Narcos or Narcos: Mexico especially. Costumes are in tune with what the cartel members and bosses wear if one googles them, The military costumes were great, though all looked brand new. Production design and casting were par. Makeup is little overdone for the main characters in the 2nd and 3rd seasons. Music is 80% excellent and 20% goofy, the title song is terrific, I never skipped it once in all 35 episodes.

Acting is also a mixed bag in my opinion but very acceptable if one considers the budget and the fact that it was made for Mexican TV. About 6/10 actors were brilliant in their portrayal of their roles, with Humberto Busto delivering a top notch performance portraying Conrado Sol and Marco de la O a distant second playing the lead. On the other hand the actors who played the DEA agents were the worst.

Overall, El Chapo is a must see series for anyone who has seen Narcos and Narcos: Mexico. In fact it's a great follow up, as the series interlaces with the other two series at different time frames. Yes, sadly the making and treatment is not on the league of the other two but the screenplay and editing is definitely better in El Chapo. The series is definitely a gem on its own and will stay in our minds for a long time, if one travels the distance of 35 episodes. 8/10 for first season, 8/10 for second season and 7/10 for the third for an average of 7.3/10 overall."
El Chapo,The best show univision has produced thus far!,"8/10...seems pretty high, doesn't it? For a show that has countless similarities to Narcos, is based on an already told take, and on a platform that isn't new. Well, I'll tell you why, it is because this IS new, for all of Latin America THIS is totally new!

Prior to this Univision has been known for absolutely terrible, terrible programming and this skyrockets them into a whole new nexus of quality programming. As far as the Latin America television options, this is an absolute home run! I couldn't have been more surprised and happy with what they have put out. Several reasons.

So, the show is MUCH better if you know your history surrounding the person, the country, and the drug trade. They changed basically everyone's name except for El Chapo, I am sure to protect themselves from the very real violence they might suffer if they offended the wrong people with their depictions of certain characters.

I.E. The families of ""Benjamin and Ramon Arellano Félix"" might not like them being depicted as the murderous bastards that they were, so they make their debut as the ""Avendaño Brothers"" instead. In that respect that have done an incredible job re-naming the characters but still keeping the authenticity of who they are/were.

Also, something that really hasn't been said in anyone's review. They have done an UNBELIEVABLE job with the character design, makeup, wardrobe(especially), and period appropriate set design. The outfits you see these characters wearing are pulled from actual outfits the real people wore, it is incredibly authentic, shockingly so! GOOGLE Ramon Arellano Félix and go to images, you will see pictures of him wearing the shirt they put him in when Do Chapo first goes to their club at the beginning of the series. Just amazing that they payed that kind of attention to detail.

I don't think the people that are bashing the show quite understand the level of history and authenticity that this show has, in that respect, it is 1 and 1 with Narcos. It follows a historical timeline perfectly and for those that are complaining about the bad quality English dubbing.....ALL DUBBING IS BAD QUALITY, OF COURSE THE MOUTHS DON'T MATCH THE WORDS.....HAHAHA WHAT?!?! (Sorry, I was shocked someone actually said that.)

Anyways, watch the show in Spanish. Take the time to read the subtitles and simply enjoy an incredibly authentic depiction of the most notorious criminals on the planet."
El Chapo,"Complex, fascinating, illuminating series about the drug trade in Mexico","I really loved this series. I thought it was much better than Narcos. If you know anything about Mexico during the past 20 years, El Chapo will be even more enjoyable because it does a great job of portraying the political, social and economic complexities of the country and it will all be familiar and very true to life. But, even if you don't know anything about Mexico, you can still enjoy it for the drama and excitement of this crime genre.

The casting was brilliant. Marco de la O did a great job as El Chapo. He captured the accent,the mannerisms and even resembled El Chapo so much that you could forget he was an actor playing a part. It felt like you were really seeing El Chapo. Even the clothing he wore was the same as what you see in photos and videos of El Chapo, so the attention to detail was amazing. Humberto Busto was also outstanding as the corrupt politician Conrado Sol. The actors who played former Presidents Salinas, Fox, Calderon, Peña Nieto and other recognizable politicians in Mexico were really good at creating their characters. Chapo's family, friends, and henchmen were also convincing in their roles. Overall, it was a believable cast and very well acted.. Almost everything that happens in the show happened in real life, so it's almost like watching a documentary.

The series comes down very heavy on the Mexican government and justice system, showing how corrupt everyone is. The message is clear; the drug cartels are run on a model very similar to Mexico's political parties, manipulating everything and everyone to achieve their goals. El Chapo is violent and ruthless, but so is almost everyone else in power, so there are really no ""good guys"" in the show, just different groups of people trying to advance their interests. It explains why the drug cartels came into existence in Mexico, why they got so out of hand, and why no one could stop them. With or without El Chapo, the drug trade continues today because it's not dependent on one man. It's a well-oiled machine that keeps running, and the leadership positions get filled by whoever is the most manipulative and ruthless, just like the political system. The most evil character in the show is Conrado Sol because he has no loyalty, no morals and no scruples, and yet he hypocritically pretends to be the savior of Mexico. As long as Mexico is in the hands of people like him, there's no solution to the problem of corruption and violence.

I appreciated that the show was from a Mexican point of view, and that the DEA characters had small roles. I'm not particularly interested in DEA agents, and am more interested in seeing how the drug trade impacts Mexican society. The violence engendered by the warring cartels and the Mexican government's war on drugs is of great importance to the Mexican people and has made life very difficult for them. While El Chapo is the recognizable name and face for the problem, the show made it clear that the problem is more widespread than that, and that the economic and social problems of Mexico created conditions in which drug trafficking became a viable way of making money. The show doesn't whitewash the violence of the narcos, but it does put it in a social context.

Overall I would highly recommend the show to anyone who likes this genre. It's violent but not overly graphic. It's definitely binge worthy."
El Chapo,Excellent!,"This is sort of like the Mexican equivalent of Narcos, really enjoyed this series - - I thought the acting was great and and all in all was done very stylishly - well worth a watch.

I hope more series are to follow.. Don't be put off by the negative review/s try it and make up your own mind - so glad i watched it all!"
El Chapo,Great series that will give you insight into Joaquin Guzman,"What has struck me the most about this well-acted series is the sense of impending doom under which ""El Chapo"" lived. He worked hard and ruthlessly as a prolific murderer to become a ""Patron"" only to find his position always at the edge of a precipice. He is constantly betrayed, undermined, falsely accused (of the Cardinal's murder)and pursued by assassins. His life would make one wonder why anybody would be stupid enough to want his job. There would be a ton of cash but no peace ever in site for such a man or his family. I know of his impoverished upbringing. And that growing and trafficking drugs was the only way to make money in his isolated community. Multiple generations of his family were in the trade as Marijuana and Opium growers. His cousins were in it. He was born into it. But you would think that there would enough examples of how this would not end well for an intelligent man to make the decision to get out. Apparently in El Chapo's position it doesn't matter how smart one is. And you wonder if the lucky ones are not the ones who get killed early in their careers. Instead of living life constantly on the run from everyone and under daily mental suffering. This is a tale of some one willingly allowing himself to be sucked into an abyss. He had to know that if they didn't take his life, they would still take everything else. And they did. What you might question is the mentality of some one who continues going down that road despite knowing what lies at the end. And I also must question the mentality of a popular sub-culture in Mexico that worships and admires these ""Narcos."" They write songs about them. Do they not have eyes to see what happens to these people? El Chapo's life was not a pleasant one."
El Chapo,"Not as good as ""Narcos"", but it's not as bad as people are saying.","First of all, I have a lot of doubts when I'm starting to see a TV show and the show have a rating below 8.0 on IMDb. So, I take a chance with these one at 7.9. . . I have a lot of doubts because these show was produced by Univision in association with Netflix, and as Latin guy that love products of great quality, Univision is the last company I expect good productions or shows. They always do a bad job bringing a touch of reality and suspense in the 99% of shows they produce related with drug kingpins. . .I was expecting a lot of blood and a lot of violence in the gruesome way and I finish disappointed when I see the words ""Univision"", I knew in that moment that I have to change my view of what I will see in ""El Chapo"". So, if you read this, you need to change the mentality of expecting a lot of blood, violence, gunshots, abductions, etc; because these show is not that. It's more like a political thriller and the government corruption at all the levels. It's not as good as I expected because the story of ""El Chapo"" have a lot of moments that presented in the right way can make an understatement, but the producers decided to put these story in an ambiguous way. Still, is the best ""El Chapo"" TV show/movie to these date, but I think they could do a better job."
El Chapo,"Starts Slow, Becomes Great","I love crime dramas (Narcos, Breaking Bad, etc.), And was initially disappointed to find that El Chapo starts (very) slow. I actually turned this off the first time I tried watching it . El Chapo looked cheap and cheesy.

Then after the second or third episode, it really picked up and became as good or better than Narcos:Mexico. When this show gets good, it really gets good. This show isn't as glamorous as Narcos. It's more realistic, and just as gripping. With El Chapo you get prison scenes, gang wars, and everything in between."
El Chapo,"Watchable, but lacking something",Comentario no disponible
El Chapo,Underrated but surprisingly good!!,"I watched it after Narcos, like most people apparently did, and i was caught by surprised by how actually good this show is!! The acting is good, the pacing is good, the plot is good. It's more realistical than Narcos (comparatively speaking), way more gritty and less glamour. The first 2 seasons are especially good ( El Cano is a very good villain). Don Sol's storyline gets a little trite in season 3 but i absolutely recommend this show!"

El Chapo,Don't watch this after Narcos,I've tried giving this show a chance on three different occasions 2 years apart. If you've watched Narcos: Mexico you won't be able to go through 3 episodes no matter how hard you try.
El Chapo,Great show,"Although production is not as expensive as Narcos, the strongest point here is the connection with victims. While in Narcos Colombians are just props, in El Chapo you can have a broader view of how cartels and corruption affect Mexican lives (S2E08 is a punch in the stomach). Here there's no glamourizing like Narcos. No fancy farms or lame parties. Here cartels are depicted as true criminals with no regard to anyone but them. And to make it worse, you see a state engulfed in corruption, from mayors to the president, police to the army. In my opinion Narcos 3rd season is somehow tiresome, focused on a security manager of one of the cartels, gives me impression they are extending the story that should be coming to an end. Here you wanna know more about his scape from prison and how they finally caught him after that interview with Sean Penn."
El Chapo,Can't Get Enough of El Chapo!,Comentario no disponible
El Chapo,Oustanding show - I just prefer the style of Narcos,"This excellent and involving Netflix joint venture about El Chapo is mesmerizing. The story is just so darn good as only a true story can be. The lead actor looks like him. After finishing Season 1 I can't wait for more. I can see this is a real detailed series which will show how and why he became the person he is.

Many watching this have just seen Narcos and comparisons are inevitable. Narcos is easier to understand for English speaking viewers with the narration. The cinematography and settings and more beautiful. The cast of Narcos is more attractive than the real life characters - unrealistically so. El Chapo is harder to follow without the narrator to clarify the plot. There are a lot of characters and the cast is a bit similar - some of the girlfriends/wives look alike as do some of the supporting drug dealers. El Chapo doesn't glamorize things for sure.

I kind of wish the Narcos people had done this show in their style. But it still is very very good. Completely blows away any fictional thrillers about the drug trade."
El Chapo,Wow,"I was fascinated with this series and can't wait for the next one. There is definitely room for this story to continue. I think Narcos creates a great background. Wikipedia says the real El Chapo carries the same notoriety as Al Capone, is listed on the Fortune 500 list, and matched the wealth of Pablo Escobar. The series seems to have only started this story and I'm ready for it to continue. Disclaimer- as noted above, the series does depict him as a scary criminal. Not a hero in any way. Yet I admit to being fascinated by the story."
El Chapo,Amazing show,When I first started this I was skepticalad I don't like listening to different audio to the mouths actually moving in Mexican. But after you get used to it... wow what a show totally blown away it's like narcos on steds. Would highly recommend.
El Chapo,"Okay, he spent a lot of time in prison, but . . .",Comentario no disponible
El Chapo,Great,"Great show to watch, I enjoy it as much as the series Narcos."
El Chapo,"Reasonable, no more",Dubbing spoils it for me. Watching this after watching narcos Mexico and got to say it's no comparison.
El Chapo,Too much gayischness,"Loved it, better than Narcos, but the gay scenes were a bit too much. Yeah, it could be true but why on earth put so much time in it. Almost every episode I saw 2 guys kissing. Nothing against it but a bit too much if you ask me.

The rest was great, strong actors and a damn hot elba!!! Great job netflix!"
El Chapo,Good binge-material,"Not mutch decent dialogue, to easy, simple. Some episodes are chaotic, to many jumps in time, from one time to another time in history. Nontheless very watchable. Interesting story. The actors are good to bad the dialogues are simple but they work with what they have and non-dialogue scenes are good."
El Chapo,Could have been done in one season,"It's a very dragged out series with a lot of unnecessary padding to drag out the story. It's more of a Mexican Telenovela than a serious contender for a global audience. The actor who plays Chapo, is a good copy of him. It is as action filled as Narcos, and is not as professionally edited. The editing is pretty choppy and that makes for poor continuity. Scenes seem to be inserted randomly and at times, during the action scenes, the viewer has no idea of who the different factions are. While Mexicans may know the story, characters and events, there needs to be better character development and context provided for viewers from other countries who wish to understand the situation better. The series is watchable but be prepared to watch it over a period of time or it does get boring, particularly when events are happening and the viewer does not have the context as to the reason."

Avatar: The Last Airbender,"14 Years Later, 25 Years Old, Sitting Here In Quarantine, Drinking Wine and Crying","I don't know when, but for me, Netflix started streaming Avatar and I was like my childhood, It calls to me. As I mentioned I'm sitting here alone in my apartment in quarantine rewatching my favorite show from when I was in middle school. 14 years later and as an adult I'm sitting here crying because of all the emotion that's portrayed in every episode. It's just so real. It might be the massive amounts of alcohol that I'm consuming on my own but I swear, this show is so heartfelt and raw. Practically every episode tackles loss, friendship, bravery and humility all tied in with some friendly humor. The show holds up so well. 10/10 would recommend even without the wine."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,"Great show with fantastic messages, lessons, philosophical discussions, character development, plots, and comedy","This is show is one of the best shows ever created. There are many great lessons in this show that all people (adults and kids) should learn. The show delves into many branches of philosophy, including moral philosophy, that teaches people how to think critically and to always help and understand others. The show has a fantastic plot filled with great comedy and character development. The show has great action scenes as well! I highly recommend this show to everyone!"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Saw for the first time age 25: one of my fav shows now,"I'm not big on cartoons or the like but my husband had been asking me for years to watch the avatar. Well it came to Netflix so I said ok begrudgingly, thinking it was more so a show for him to enjoy his nostalgia and I definitely didn't think it would be enjoyable to see as an adult, assuming it was a kids show.

I was very wrong! I loved the show, it's def one of my favorites. So wish there was more! It is humorous and touching, generally it put me in a good mood afterwards. I'll def rewatch it.

The characters are all interesting and have great development. Scenes are beautiful. It's just a great show. Give it a watch!!"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,The best show Nickelodeon has aired,"OK, so I was 12 when this show came out and needless to say, I was completely enamored by it. For a TV station like Nickelodeon, best known for its wacky shows like SpongeBob, Rocko's Modern Life and their sitcoms like Drake and Josh, to suddenly come out with this anime-inspired animated series with deep philosophical themes as well as tackling genocide and war, this was a massive step forward.

Of course, this isn't the first form of media that has incorporated the power of the elements, but their method of how they do it here is remarkable. For every element to be adopted into its own nation, reflecting the psyches and philosophies attributed to the respective element is truly inspiring.

All the characters are written for and performed expertly, save for maybe some of the guest characters (*cough cough* Jet). My favourite character by far is Zuko. The progression and development of this character is incredible and captures perfectly the transition from villain to antihero to hero. Aang is a good character too, but he's a bit of a goody-two-shoes half the time. Katara and Sokka are equally appealing characters, as well as Toph.

The brilliance of this show is that it is perfectly paced. Sure, you get the occasional filler episode, but every episode (leaving out The Great Divide) has a purpose and adds more layers to this intriguing story and the world it is set in.

Again, for a children's show to incorporate seriously heavy topics and still have a silly sense of humour is just impressive. I get annoyed every time someone stereotypes this series as just a 'kids show', brushing it off. This show can be watched by someone of any age, and that is one of the reasons I admire it so much. It's not pandering at all and tackles the heavy subject matter in a mature way.

Sadly, after The Legend of Korra, Nickelodeon never seemed to follow in the footsteps of Avatar which I found upsetting. Kids need more shows like this, if I'm being honest."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,The best in animated storytelling...,"Even though Avatar is of American origin, it has a lot of Japanese anime influence, particularly visually, but keeps the best of both animation cultures with it's American sense of playfulness and more realized characterization. The creators of Avatar have really crafted an artistic piece of fun and creative storytelling that is a rare gem for American TV. Avatar has strength in all the major areas of film and story, starting at ground level with an exceptionally believable world setting where war is taking place among the different nations. The main characters who find themselves caught in this struggle are three teens named Katara, Sokka, and Aang (the Avatar) who have set forth to bring harmony to the world through their influence and through the powers of the still developing Avatar. There is lot of humor and fun in this show, and you can't help but to really love these characters and their pets. But this is just the beginning of the glue that keeps you coming back. Great plots and stunning visuals are just as much of importance to the overall success of the show. The story lines are top notch, being both episodic in nature and chronologically integral from one show to the next. Each episode usually introduces a new and genuinely interesting opposition and/or characters to be overcome by the end of the show, and visually there is plenty of awe inspiring backgrounds and quality animation. With just enough well paced action, some sincere points of moral conviction (can you believe it), and witty humor makes the show a winning combination. This is entertainment for all ages, and definitely a must see."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,A Statement On Perfection. True Unequaled Bliss.,"This review will be very long. I adore this show with every fibre of my being, and view it to be a piece of animated perfection. I implore people to avoid the disgusting live-action adaptation by director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is a disrespectful sham that mocks everything that the show stood for and mastered.So as for the show itself, where to begin? Well let's start with the story overall.

Avatar tells a complete a perfectly paced epic plot over the course of 61 22 minute episodes. The show contains several unique and beautifully detailed characters among its main cast, all of whom are given consistent and engaging development throughout. From family related guilt and angst, identity dilemmas and the characters constant, overarching and looming quest, the characters are pressed with many trials which actually truly change them over the course of their magnificent journey. Aside from the primary cast, many intriguing and varied side characters appear throughout the adventure. They offer comedic levity, new forms of drama and help to add to the deep mythological and philosophical backbone of the show. All characters are exquisitely written and voice acted, with not a badly portrayed among them.

Next I will cover the show's borderline legendary animation. It is a sight to behold indeed. I believe I am justified in believing that such stellar production values will never again be pared with this level of artistic imagination again, at least not in my lifetime. The scope, creativity and energy of the shows animation is second to no other show, and it's balance of colour is never anything less than sublime. Aside from sweeping and moving visuals, Avatar also offers fast paced and unbelievably well choreographed action scenes (once again, second to none) and well timed slapstick comedy. Not only is the animation stunning, it is also staggeringly versatile.

The show's epic mythos is also very strong, and demands to be deepened and added to (thankfully Korra is doing just that). It takes inspiration from Buddhist, Inuit, Western, Japanese and Korean cultures to deliver it's unique world, as well as many original and creative elements in conjunction with the more recognisable real world concepts. The show manages to weave philosophy and deep moral concepts within its world and characters, creating one of the most fleshed out fantasy worlds of the last several decades.

In conclusion, what can I even say? I love Avatar: TLA more every time I experience it, and it is one of very few shows (or even films) which can provoke a primal emotional response from me each time I see it, without fail. It sends shivers down my spine, and puts a tear to my eye, leaving me totally satisfied and fulfilled each time. My favourite television show, of all time."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Breathtaking,"I love it, it's amazing. It did have a few weaker episodes, but overall I can easily say this is one of the best anime I've ever seen. Most memorable too. The protagonists were very relatable and easy to root for.

Although the show tried to convince us that ""the Avatar team members"" were just kids, they all looked and acted at least a few years older, especially Aang (he really doesn't sell a 12-year-old kid, especially in season 2 and 3). But that's a good thing. I liked it better for it. Prince Zuko is another great example. He was supposed to be around 16, but seemed more like 18, if not even 19. Again, I preferred it this way.

Characters' archers were done splendidly. Especially Zuko's. His journey was by far the most transforming and I liked how he struggled to choose between good and evil.

Aang's crush on Katara was cute at first, and I thought nothing of it, but then it has developed into something more, even if it did take a long time for it. Their love was definitely something to root for.

And last but not least, Sokka and Toph. Both were absolutely amazing. One a warrior with a fun side, always saying something funny, but also really looking out for his sister and other friends, and the other a blind girl with unimaginable power. Even animal companions had their own characters. Loved it.

And the finale! It was amazing. One of the best ones in the history of TV shows. ""Avatar"" really built up to it. Just go see it. I couldn't recommend more.

PS: If you haven't watched yet ""The Legend of Korra"", which is supposed to be Avatar's sequel, please don't. It destroys everything ""The Last Airbender"" holds dear. You'll just end up depressed. instead, pretend it doesn't exist. Trust me, it's better this way."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,"not just a great animated show or 'kids' show, it's a major show of this decade","Avatar The Last Airbender shouldn't be underestimated. For a while I didn't even look twice at it due to it being on Nickelodeon and me being past the age of watching anything on Nick aside from the classic Nicktoons or Nick shows from the 1990s. But word got around that it was really fantastic, a sort of Kung fu style show where a master goes from place to place having adventures. Turns out the people I heard the word from weren't kidding: the saga of Aang, the last airbender and Avatar, who masters the four elements (air, earth, water, fire) and has to save the world by stopping the power-hungry fire lord, Ozai, is as epic as anything I've ever seen. It's an achievement of storytelling that creeps up on you, and while the first season isn't perfect the second season delivers episode after episode that enriches the characters and makes us care about them as we would in, for obvious example, Star Wars.

In fact, the only minor complaint I would have against the second season (not sure yet about the third) is that it borrows quite heavily from the Empire Stikes Back (i.e. the 'one-who-will-save-us-all' mythology from Joseph Campbell is off training with an old master, feels his friend(s) in pain and danger in the future, rushes off before finishing training, bad things ensue, etc). But really, all of the characters get developed quite well, and if anything the development of the character Prince Zuko, a scarred son of Ozai who has been banished until he can bring back the Avatar along with his banished uncle Iroh, is astonishing in its complexity. We don't care about this character at first, in the first season he comes off like a whiner with Iroh as the wonderful comic relief (think Pokemon if the brother and sister weren't so annoying). But by season two a whole other dimension comes into play: who are you, and what are you doing with yourself?

The trek with the three main characters, and the extra characters like Toph (a little blind girl who is one of those great bad-asses you have to see to believe), is one that is sophisticated enough to bring in adults, and for kids it's often just rollicking fun when it isn't deep or dark. The villains are convincing and scary, the humor hits when it needs to (and sometimes it can be just downright trippy and hilarious, like the second episode of season two, the Cave of Two Lovers), and the animation is often breathtaking. As they say on the internet now: it's made of Win!"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,It's 2018 and I still watch this show,"I grew up with this show and I can't imagine my life without it. It truly is not only the best cartoon series, but also one of the best series out there. With an incredible story, beautiful animation, amazing characters, great villains and awesome action sequences, it's simply flawless in every way possible.

Season 1 starts off slowly but only because of the terrific character introductions and world building, introducing the lovable team of protagonists, Aang, Katara and Sokka, being chased by the angsty Prince Zuko, accompanied by his adorable and wise uncle.

Season 2 is probably the best of the three, and introduces an awesome new character, Toph, and a perfect new villain, Azula. The animation also improves and is packed with action, emotion and epicness.

The Final Season is also magnificent and the characters are at their best at this point, and so is the animation quality.

Overall this show is a must! I've shown it to several kids and adults alike and they always end up getting hooked."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,I just rewatched the best TV series in the history of the world,"Hi there.

It is September 2016, more than a decade this this series was done, and I will be your reviewer this evening.

Our menu is simple -- we are only offering just one review and that review only comes with the very rare ""perfect score"" of 10. Sorry, no substitutions.

I am a prolific reviewer here (over 1350 reviews) which is a polite way of saying I watch too much TV and have too much time on my hands.

When I first watched this series I made the same ""mistake"" most reviewers do when reviewing anything for the first time. As good as it was, I ""assumed"" that over time something better would appear. But that never happened.

So after 10 years I have given up. I just rewatched the whole series top to bottom and currently have a nice endorphin buzz going because this astonishing series just gets better as you go, and the final episode just plants a big smile on your face.

Perfect writing, direction, story, dialog, animation, characters. And all with a chewy moral center.

(And some really deep metaphysical concepts -- like the island where everything is connected. That is a reference to one of the oldest religions in the world.)

I know what you are thinking. I tried to get into Korra but all I kept seeing there were the many errors the producers made in trying to improve on something which simply cannot be improved on.

It is official. I am calling it.

The best overall series in the history of TV.

And it just gets better with age.

Avatar: The Last Airbender,One of the best animated shows I seen,"This is a anime style cartoon that kids and adults will enjoy watching. It really is one of the best cartoon show I seen in a while, there is little to almost no flaw to this show. I really wished it was longer though, instead of just 3 seasons. It really is a memorable adventure, which has many elements that will keep your attention from beginning to end. Plus just about every characters in this show is memorable and not just the main characters either, and for a bunch of cartoon characters I actually cared about what happens to them. One of the best animated series I seen, and I highly recommend anyone that enjoys a good story in a cartoon to watch this amazing show.

9.3/10"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Well done,I thought that Avatar when it first came out was gonna be another Nick Show flop. When the first episode came out I watched it for about 10 mins. and I thought wow and couldn't stop watching. The show I think keeps you involved. Nick has picked some bad shows but not this one. The plot is very well designed and characters are thought out and are dynamic. I think thats what makes a show good. Also the fact that when a show ends then next time then it carrys on what happened in the next episode rather than acting like it never happened. The show captures a sense of reality and makes the audience more into it. The writers write some pretty decent material. Classic comedy and new moral comedy with good values. All in all I give the show a perfect score of 10/10 stars with both thumbs way up.
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Good for the family,"I've been watching this with my 5-year-old and find it's watchable by both adults and kids. The writing and dialog aren't wooden or simplistic. Although it's not at the depth of an Aaron Sorkin show, there is intrigue and nuance in the conflicts between Aang and his adversaries as well as among the adversaries themselves.

It's this kind of writing that can absorb and involve a first-grader yet not drive his parents up a wall that makes this more interesting to watch than say a ""Fairly Odd Parents"" or Disney's ""Aaron Stone"". These are writers/creators who trust their audience to ""get it"" and who try to keep things accessible without talking down to the audience. That takes both talent and skill."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Baffling,"It's a well-written children's show. And if I were eight, I'd probably have rated it considerably higher. Or if it were being recommended to me by 8 year olds, or FOR 8 year olds. What's baffling is the number of adults recommending this to other adults, as if it weren't a children's show.

I gave it an honest effort. I got most of the way through the first season, very nearly to the end, because multiple people had told me it gets SO GOOD. But really, it's a children's show. It may get good for a children's show, but as an adult it has virtually no appeal. The protagonists are annoying children, who do the same annoying crap every episode. The antagonist is an annoying child, who does the same annoying crap every episode. Mako is an absolute delight as the uncle, but that's like saying the ocean was wet. Mako is ALWAYS a win. He is a goddamned national treasure. Mako aside though (and I am starting to feel like a broken record), it is a children's show. There is absolutely nothing in this for adults, unless it is the nostalgia for young adults who watched this and fell in love with it WHEN THEY WERE CHILDREN.

So if you watched this as a child and loved it, apparently it really holds up and you'll probably love it again. If you're a child, for god's sake stop reading this review and go watch it. I'm sure it's fantastic. However, if you're an adult being told by other adults that this is SO GOOD, do yourself a favor and ignore them. It's a children's show, there's nothing in it you'll enjoy."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,That's Rough Buddy,"Where to begin with this series, despite being a series made for children, this is one of those rare shows that could be enjoyed by all ages. The journey that Aang and his team experience is some of the best character development I have seen with a particular praise for the redemption arc of a certain character which is the BEST redemption arc on television. The series tackles a lot of adult con-tent with humorous segments sprinkled in which helps balances the series out with a fantastic world not unlike anything else on television. There is a reason as to why this show has has persisted in the publics' memory and you have to see this to truly experience the legend of the last Airbender."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Very Great story,"The art and research put into this story matches the quality of the plot and character development. This show is what Nickelodeon needs to give it some respect. Not since Samauri Jack has an American show been able to pull off an anime style that works. It's good to know that children that watch this show may actually learn what it takes to have a good story. The research put into the story is amazing. The bending styles all coincide with different styles of fighting and can be seen in every episode. The show itself is also planned out, as minor questions formed in one episode may not be answered for another 10 some episodes later, so it's not just another Nick ""story"" show like Danny Phantom, all episodes are connected and well planned out. I wouldn't doubt that the next 3 seasons are already written. The character development and writing can match even some of the best television writers out there, it may even be able to stand toe-to-toe with the works of Joss Whedon.

I give the show an easy 10/10, especially if you watch all the shows in order."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,I could never forget.,"The series that I watched once and thought it was the greatest thing since sliced Pao (Indian bread).

Loved it and Recommended it to all my pals and not one person has failed to fall in love with this epic. I ranted and raved about it wherever I went.

Then, life took over and I didn't have the time to think about or revisit the original Avatar : The Last Airbender.

Until last week, I tuned in again. I finished the episodes by the fistful, completing 3 complete seasons in 3 days.

I never thought I would miss my friends so much because by the end of this series thats what the characters will be to you. I cannot express the sadness that creeped in over the last episode when I knew it was all going to come to an end. I would no longer get to see the wonderful lives of all characters I had grown to adore & take into confidence.

Watching & experiencing this series has been one the most affirming moments of my life.

I beg you not to go without experiencing the brilliant epic that is Avatar : The Last Airbender."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,"The greatest TV show of all time. Yep, i said it.","Utterly fantastic show. Here are the things i love the most (trust me there are even more)
Character development!!! Zuko is one of my favorite characters of all time. His redemption arc is awesome.


Character moments. For example: Iroh forgiving Zuko. Need i say more?


Visuals.










Ok i think you get the idea.... Basically everything is great."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,The Greatest American Animation of All Time,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is a very mature show that can be enjoyed at any age. This show has some of the greatest characters of all time and all of them go through realistic character arcs that natural. Gorgeous animation and amazing music give the show a cinematic feel. Despite an incredible first season, each season improves its quality greatly and doesn't cease to surprise and amaze me. Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect animated show."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,The one show/piece of art that hasn't and never will be topped by anything.,"I just re-watched this series that was my childhood and feel the need to express some feelings. This is the greatest thing ever created, period. All these other reviews can only barely say how i feel about this show. If there is one thing you must do before you die, this is it. There is literally nothing else you could watch, see, hear, do etc. that could top this experience.

Have a nice day.

i mean me to thanks"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,I will never get tired of watching this show,"It is amazing. Truly amazing.

No matter what episode you start on, you get instantly hooked and wanting more. I've probably watched this show 10 times because there is truly nothing else like it. If there is, I have yet to find it. It may sound silly but this show holds a special place in my heart because that is how much I adore it."
Avatar: The Last Airbender,Brilliant,"Recently, I replied to a thread on the Rocko's Modern Life boards, and I was absolutely shocked to learn that there were those who considered this as Nick's worst. Sorry, I disagree completely. Avatar:The Last Airbender in my opinion doesn't deserve to be included down there with ChalkZone and Rocket Power, if anything this is one of Nick's best shows along with Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy and Angry Beavers.

The concept may appear simple and basic on paper, but as the show progresses the storytelling is grander, more epic and perhaps even more powerful. The animation is excellent, the music is great, the writing is consistently strong and the stories are outstanding in my opinion. And the characters, heroes and villains, have depth to them and are very likable. Avatar:The Last Airbender also benefits from superb voice work.

In conclusion, this is a brilliant show and somewhat underestimated. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Avatar: The Last Airbender,The best out there,"I never thought I'd say this, but this is one of the best things ever on TV. It is so mature, yet so childish; the perfect balance suitable for anyone. I am 16y old, and I find this show fascinating. There is so much wisdom in it, yet collided with humor and plain stupidity that you just can't say 'No' to this show. I am just glad they ended it the way they did, without bumping out the money of him, like people did to many shows. It started so naively, and ended so gloriously. What really made this show are characters; each and every one of them - from the king of the Earth Kingdom, to the very Avatar. There's a mix of 'sweet love' of childhood, 'sweet pain' of it, yet there are losses, honesty, discovery of the depths of the souls and so much more.

I watched whole three seasons in three days, and I was swallowing all that I could get. Of course, I will watch show again, slowly, to consume all that it can offer. But from what I've seen, I know that this show is something that everyone should watch. It offers so much fun for the younger ones, so much guidance and wisdom for the teens of my age, and yet so much of everything for the elder ones. It is no wonder this show has great rating on IMDb, but I think it deserves even more, just because it IS the BEST on the world.

If you didn't watch it, go buy it, WATCH IT NOW, you won't regret ONE SECOND of the time you watched it. 100 out of 10; even more."

Avatar: The Last Airbender,Boring and overrated.,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid, and I used to midly enjoy it (meaning if it was on, I'd watch it but if it wasn't, I wouldn't be upset about it). I recently decided to re-watch it cause I thought it would be nostalgic and bring back memories for me. I was disappointed when I watched almost the first two seasons, and realised how bad the show actually was. The animation style is good, and the story is also pretty good, but for some reason, watching it felt like a chore and even though I tried to force myself to watch it, I couldn't because of how boring it was.

No hate to ATLA fans because I know how hyped up people get about the show, but it just wasn't it for me."

The Get Down,Classy,"I was not there then but I can appreciate it. At times, it feels slightly overplayed (the gang scenes in EP 1 for example), but otherwise it's well done.

Music is exactly what you'd expect and the women are gorgeous. I also like the flashback elements. They were effective and not overly long or preachy, as flashbacks can get.

Story is layered, starts off at several ends and slowly weaves together. I have really enjoyed it so far.

The series also uses documentary to weave real life elements together as a political statement of the ghetto 70's NY. It's hard to imagine just how corrupted NYC was in the 70s. Just crazy"

The Get Down,"Very vivid like a time-warp almost...and a beautiful mix of history, culture, music and politics","As someone who's not a fan of rap music, I still find the historical aspects and how the elements of hip-hop came together very intriguing! All the characters are interesting and entertaining in their own ways which make me want to know more about them--making for very vivid episodes (it seems each character has their own mood that they add). Hopefully, next season we'll get to see more of those stories... As more of a disco fan, I found those parts to not be as interesting sadly but it could be because of the transition that disco was going through at the time. The parts about the music business was really eye-opening in seeing how it operate(s)(d). Hopefully, the show keeps up the cultural and historical elements that make this show feel like a time-warp, while telling us more about the non-main characters."
The Get Down,Super Def!,"This show brought tears to my eyes, it felt like I was in a time machine. Episode 6 was off the chain, I really enjoyed the authenticity and accuracy of the harmonizing style of rhyming, the systematic word play, a true Hip Hop landmark, I feel bad for the rappers of today, (noticed I said rappers not MC's, there's a difference) majority of them don't even know the history of Hip Hop, I thank whoever had the genius to do this show, showing the Bronx how it was, the disco era, vogue dancing, the shows in the park, all that. I must have called ten friends about this show, in those days my crew was called ""Ultra Sonic Sounds"" my hip hop name was ""Cheap Charlie"", and I'm proud to say I was there at that time and it was remarkable, especially how we loved to harmonize at the parks, powering our equipment from light posts, the crowds dancing, etc. Anyway Without further ado, Netflix! thanks for the memories, it is well appreciated."
The Get Down,"beautiful, poetic, exciting","I am a big fan of Baz Luhrmann's work. I love his creative, colorful and unique styles. I didn't know The Get Down was his work until i finished the show and looked it up and it made total sense that it was his work. I loved this show, by far one of my favorite Netflix series. The young men and women they chose for the cast do an excellent job acting and seemed to come so natural to them.There is also a few actors we have seen before in some of our favorite shows, which was very cool to see. It is very poetic & emotional and connecting with the characters is really easy.The story line is fun, exciting, edgy and easy to follow with a lot of historical fiction included."
The Get Down,"A new series, with the potential of becoming a cult classic","This series has everything you have been asking for. Music, drama, love, bromance, (even some action) and music. Lots of great music. Really great music.

You might be thinking that because you were not alive at that time or you didn't leave anywhere near the Bronx, you might not understand it. But i lived all my life in Argentina, and i was born on 1999 and i have really adored it. The scriptwriters understand their job perfectly.

The speed on storytelling is plainly delightful, and the story itself makes you suffer and wonder a lot. Its awesome. And lots of fun. Lots.

Please watch it, we need more series like that on Netflix. We deserve, as a society, good entertaining quality shows like this.

I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."
The Get Down,Perfect- exceeded my expectations,"Perfect, Perfect , Perfect depiction of the start of RAP in the bronx. Having, been younger in those days and leaving in the east coast. People like granmaster Flash, Kool Herc, etc.. They were the people you'd daydream about, without really knowing anything about them (pre-internet). Now, the way, the show goes on, it shows all these persona's as seen through the eyes-of fresh young dudes. Example-the way-Shaolin fantastic is represented-how they focus on his red pumas--and how the kids talk about him ""His hands are samurai swords"". This is the way, anybody who was there(youngins)-remember that time. Now, some people say It's not gritty (If you want gritty-see Sin HOMBRE), the whole point of rap, was that in was against violence- so, it actuality, this is the memory that will have stayed with the youth, more than the violence-the media loves to OFFICIALLY potray as a BRONX staple. Now, the director is Baz Luhrman, and man, did he potray the music in the most perfect way, the way he could parallelly show some rap group trying to rap, and and the same time a disco pre-queen singining. No, other director could have really showed the music so finely as Baz. If you want nitty -gritty streets-watch the Warriors. If you're genuinely interested in RAP the beginnings, before Gangster rappers. Then run and watch this."
The Get Down,A must watch for all...,"I watch a lot of TV shows; most of them in fact. This is the one that has me swapping from VLC to Wikipedia to check facts. I have never been so intrigued to learn so much about an oppressed past that happened so recently in my own country. How do we not know about these things? Fortunately. we soon all will.

This show will bring out the Get Down in you. You probably don't even know what that means. I didn't. But you soon will. We all need it, and it is here for your learning.

Get down my friends, and understand what that means."
The Get Down,The true essence of Hip Hop...,"Wow! Just finished the first episode of 'The Get Down' and being a massive Hip Hop fan with a healthy appreciation of countless musical genres stretching from Punk to House, it's perhaps inevitable that I've fallen in love with this show. Everything about it seems well thought out, the characters, the sets, the wardrobes, the music, just everything! Yes, it's flamboyant and a bit over the top but very much in keeping with the period.

I'm not gonna go into a detailed review other than to say - get it watched. Hope the rest of the series lives up to first episode - if it does - this will be the best TV show of 2016. Word up."
The Get Down,"Beautifully poetic music history - colorful, crazy and wild","I saw part one minutes ago. As someone to whom Grandmaster Flash and the likes of him is a big part of growing up the movie strikes a cord with me by nature.

But apart from that I like the wild mixture of dance movie, musical, Hip Hop party, poetry slam, documentary, Kungfu flick, coming of age, spraying, ""mastering"" the ceremony, DJing, comedy, drama and romance. I recommend to watch the documentary Rumble Kings before watching The Get Down to fetch some historical background information.

Hip Hop with its sampling, mixing, scratching and juggling with words opened up a musical playground for audience and artists. The movie transforms this successfully into visuals."
The Get Down,Mediocre,"I assume many reviewers have already used the let-down pun, but it's truly my sentiment. This show will betray you the moment you start liking it. The beginning draws you in but I have two main issues down the line. First, the show doesn't know whether to be a musical or a more gritty and 'real' story, Second, the plot slowly spirals out of control. Story lines and character actions stop making sense about half-way through. After a magical start viewers are left disenchanted by mediocre acting and a script that could have used a few more weeks in review. Typical 5 star show, with 10 points for the extravagant visuals and 1 point for substance."
The Get Down,Genius!,"Let's start by saying I am a 54 year old white woman with a 15 year old son and we both LOVE this show - go figure! We just finished watching the final episode of this season and can not wait until the next season. The 70s, the Bronx, the clothes (Huckapoo shirts - I didn't think anyone remembered those but they were quintessential garments back then). What's not to love - the editing, the music, the story and characters are all genius. Baz Luhrman has done it again. Such nostalgia presented in a modern way. Love the news footage - I'm guessing some of it is authentic?!? I highly recommend this show. Have fun!"

The Get Down,Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this. Having been born in NYC in 1977, I've always been fascinated with movies and documentaries that portray the era.

There are some redeemable qualities of the show: the music, of course, as well as Jimmy Smits' and Shameik Moore's performances. However, Luhrmman really drops the ball when it comes to over-stylizing the show. Anyone who lived in late 70s/early 80s NYC will attest to the fact that most of the city was a crime-ridden wasteland. Luhrmann tries, unsuccessfully, to capture this but the tone is simply not gritty enough; there's no real ""edge"" to the show. The Warriors, in all it's campy glory, gives a far better snapshot of the grittiness of the time, both through tone and through cinematography. The Get Down is campy at times, but in a bad way. For example, I'm baffled by Shaolin Fantastic's bizarrely and randomly choreographed Kung Fu flourishes. Perhaps I'm missing something here - it seems much more like a nod to Wu Tang Clan - but they didn't really arrive on the scene for about another decade and a half, and in a totally different borough, Grasshopper.

Additionally, I think that Luhrmann (or perhaps the scriptwriters) insert the cultural, political, and social happenings of the time as purely incidental. Yes, there was a mention or two of Star Wars, which debuted in May of '77, and an episode was sort of framed around the Great Blackout of July 1977. However, there were a number of misleading scenes: for example, the riots and looting that took part largely in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Yes, there was looting beyond those perimeters, but Bushwick was literally burned to the ground. During another scene we see two characters playing an Atari 2600, which wasn't released until September 11, 1977. Music that was not released in 1977 is utilized during some scenes.

Part of the problem likely has to do with the fact that Luhrmann is so culturally disconnected from the subject matter. He was a 14 year old boy living in Australia at the time; he can't properly recreate the pressure-cooker atmosphere that was happening in late 70s NYC because he didn't experience it, and likely doesn't really know anyone who did either. Mad Men did an amazing job of incorporating cultural milestones to frame the narrative of the show. Similarly, The Wackness perfectly encapsulates what it felt like growing up in the city in the summer of 1994. When I watch movies like Dazed and Confused and Stand By Me or the TV shows Freaks and Geeks and The Wonder Years, I feel like I'm transported to those periods of time in small town America. Unfortunately, The Get Down isn't doing it for me, and although it's flawed, Spike Lee's Summer of Sam does a better job of portraying the Summer of 77 by acknowledging touchstone events like the Son of Sam murders, the emergence of punk rock, CBGBs, the 77 Yankees, and Studio 54. All these amazing musical genres were burgeoning at the exact same time, and it's a shame that The Getdown treats most of it like it's inconsequential.

Lastly, I really have to say that Jaden Smith is total joke in this. His ""character"" becomes slightly more tolerable in the later episodes, but he clearly lacks the acting chops to be able to keep up with the rest of the cast. I say ""character"" using quotation marks since part of me seriously suspects that his ridiculous hippy-dippy new age dialogue has been lifted right out of his Twitter feed."
The Get Down,Great series!,"This is a great series. There are little things that they got wrong that you would only know if you grew up then... some songs that were a year or two off but it does a fantastic job of capturing life in N.Y. in the 70s.. I graduated from Taft H.S. in 1973 so I know the flavor.. I recognize some of the places and I love the way they blended historic footage with film footage to create a nice image of The Bronx in the 70s. Some of the stuff .. like some of the gang stuff.. was a little over done.. When I was coming up the gangs I knew about in my area were The Black Pearls, The Young Saigons, Savage Skulls and The Black Spades .. there were many others.. but I was not a gang banger. When I moved to the Belmont Ave Ave area the Ching A Ling Nomads had a clubhouse right around the corner on Arthur Ave.. This series does a good job of capturing the fashions and dialog of the time as well.."
The Get Down,A must watch!,"This show is a breath of fresh air: beautiful and inspirational.

It's about art, friendship, love, fighting for your dreams and finding your freedom.

There are some great characters, portrayed by a talented cast. You'll end up with lots of favorites!

The show is lively, colorful, warmhearted and with non stop fun and good music.

It really has the potential to become a classic.

Please do yourself a favor and go watch The Get Down immediately.

I enjoyed every minute of the show and I can't wait for part 2."
The Get Down,I can't believe this show was canceled!,"GREAT SHOW. I feel fortunate to have gotten one season, but pissed that such a fantastic piece of work was cut short."
The Get Down,"Nostalgic, idealized musical into the 70s","An extremely well produced and high budget show about the emergence of black music like rap and hip hop in the 70s New York. It is a drama and musical with fantastic song and dance numbers that are intertwined into the general drama storyline making it all come together in an elegant way.

It is also a very historical education about musical and cultural evolution.

Season one is smashing, absolutely outstanding, and season two losing some sparks and magic.

This is basically a musical so everything feels quite a bit idealized, almost like a cartoon with real actors wrapped in cotton candy.

The cast is wonderful, storyline excellent an original style of production and storytelling and the soundtrack is fantastic. This show is a real gem to watch and will probably be regarded as a milestone in TV production.

Absolutely recommend you watch first season, it is pure enjoyment and great entertainment."
The Get Down,The best,This is my favorite tv-show in the whole wide world. I am still devastated that it wasn't renewed.
The Get Down,Fun,"It ain't accurate, but it's a lot of fun to watch."
The Get Down,A good history review; The origin of Hip Hop - If there should be one.,"Watched with my 20 yr old Son before he left for College. After getting past the poor acting and the feeling that I was watching the ""Last Dragon II"" I was able to explain the arc of music. My generation is fortunate to see the emergence of Reggie, decline of Rock & Roll, decrease of R&B bands/Groups & death of Disco. All this over a twenty year period. Which is now mark with the rise of Hip Hop & Rap which continues today. This opened a discussion over the parallel arc of drugs from LSD, Heroin, PCP & Crack. Furthermore we were able to talk about politics cause and effects, crime, gangs, inner city life etc. Bottom line I was able to show him how good he has it. He didn't have to worry about what color to wear or neighborhood to avoid. He was well feed and never had to check a Payphone for a forgotten quarter. His life is full of electronics, color TV and wireless phones. But the downward trend of the creative bands and R&B groups will leave a hole in his generation. Which is why most movies are rehashed, poorly acted repeats or saga's. And although this series is fresh and new the characters, Director and Writers are wack, look too young and give no life to what Could have been a great story."
The Get Down,Was sadly canceled.,"The Get Down story is set in 1970s New York. The once radiant metropolis is completely run down and practically broke. The atmosphere is tense and threatens to change at any moment. Last but not least, criminal gangs are forming everywhere, ensuring that there is always unrest and never safety on the streets. Times are tough -- a devastating reality that even a teenage gang in the South Bronx feels uncomfortably every day.

""The Get Down"" portrays the beginnings of hip-hop quite well and with a lot of realism.

The setting and costumes are also wonderful.

The soundtracks of the series are banging anyway.

It's a shame the series was canceled... But for anyone interested in the history of hip-hop, it's definitely worth seeing."
The Get Down,This show deserves much more attention.,Comentario no disponible
The Get Down,Revisionist drivel,"This is a great story if you never lived in the Bronx during the 1970s. Rife with revisions, omissions and straight up fabrications, it is the ""fantastic"" story of stereotypes, generalizations, archetypes and characters with no substance or historical grounding at all. This show gets everything wrong. Nice sets, cute costumes, too bad they are largely anachronisms culled from hip-hop story books and not by asking people who actually lived in those times. Far too unrealistic and revisionist for anyone who lived in this era. I wouldn't waste my time with this again, too bad, I can't get back the time wasted on the first 6. It was funny laughing at how wrong they got it, though.More like the Let Down! LOL Keep trying!"
The Get Down,Loving this show,"If I was a New Yorker, this show might raise questions. But I'm not. So I can just enjoy the music and the way that Baz Lurhman celebrates beauty and life where others see decay. Everyone thought New York was dead in the 70s, when it was just beginning. I've always rolled my eyes when people talk about youth being our future, but this is a story about that possibility. Not all young, but perhaps some, people didn't see ruin and the end in the Bronx, but all kind of possibility, beauty, power, a canvas, and scope for living life. What else would you do if you are young and never knew anything else? Making art might just be instinctive."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Long in-depth interviews without the ad break,"I always enjoyed interesting guests in the various late shows having a bit more time to tell an interesting story. However, even if they had the full 10 minutes, you felt like you were missing out as they had to be cut off after one or two anecdotes. Additionally, the ad breaks always disrupted the flow of the conversation and even if you decided to catch up the day after on YouTube, you'd have to search for all the various clips in the correct order to have seen it all.

All of that is now gone. ""My next guest needs no introduction"" allows Letterman to do what he seemingly always wanted to do - just have an in-depth conversation with an interesting guest, but without any interruptions. You can tell he's enjoying this and he seems to be willing to make the most of this new format. In the first episode, we have already seen him put a lot of research into his guest, Barack Obama. Future episodes will show us whether Letterman will continue to put as much effort into his job as interviewer, but I have very high hopes and think this show will continue to be revealing and entertaining.

Overall, I quite enjoyed the first episode and I have very high hopes for the episodes to come."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Very interesting,Heart Warming interviews. Very interesting and surprising.
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,It's not a late night talk show,"I've seen a lot of reviews stating that the show was not funny, not in the same vein as his talk show, etc.

This is not the late show with David letterman. This is not a show of him interviewing who ever the new hot star is promoting the new hot movie. This is Letterman interviewing people that he personally finds fascinating. This isn't a stand up routine or even a comedy. He's asking the deeper questions and giving them a platform to really speak without being edited by networks. He uses this show to give a look into the people themselves not just their new project. I personally have enjoyed the relaxed nature where he is able to bring out a side of the celebrities, and what they have experienced.

If your looking for the late show this is not it."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,I think people have the wrong idea...,"It seems too many are coming to this show expecting The Late Show part 2.

That is dumb. Yes, it's David Letterman. We all get that. But in no way has this show been promoted or promised anything of the sort. This is a serious, sit down interview with very important, very influential people on a variety of very important topics. Yeah, there are some funny things mixed throughout, but that's incidental.

This is not about you laughing or thinking it's the Netflix answer to late night. It isn't. This is astounding, honest interviews with people about inspirational and heartbreaking things. And it's utterly fantastic.

Quit thinking that Letterman is out for laughs here, he isn't. Watch it with no expectations, and I think you'll be in for a treat."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,The Longer Interviews You Wanted To See,"Sometimes Letterman had guests you wanted to see more of, rather than the 5 or 6 minutes they were allotted on his previous shows with CBS and NBC. Consider it done now with Dave's new Netflix show, ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction"".

Gone are (most) wise cracks and self deprecating humor Letterman was famous for on his late-night shows. There's no band, no lengthy witty monologue about current events, and really no set either. Filmed in a college auditorium in New York, the ""set"" is two leather chairs and a table sitting in the middle of a large stage. Lights, cameras and other technical equipment are sometimes seen in various shots throughout the program but that's the whole feel of the show; it's not an error and it fits nicely with the format.

We see a different Letterman here than the one we're used to. A white-bearded, easygoing fellow who appears to be a lot more chill and in his element. There's no pressure to keep people laughing and tuning in, and it shows on screen (that's not a bad thing). There's no hard-nosed journalism, thankfully. Consider it like this: two friends chatting about life, and you the viewer, are invited to listen in. Very personal questions, and very personal answers that are from the heart.

Letterman talks with the kind of guests you wish you saw more of when they were on his late-night shows. ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction"" (and yet he does introduce them) is nearly an hour long, broken up with brief produced segments to keep the flow going. You probably won't catch every episode; rather you'll want to see the ones with people you admire or those whom always have something interesting to say. And that's OK; that's just the kind of show it is. Personally, I tuned in to the first episode with Barack Obama (his first talk show appearance since leaving office), and I'll probably watch the next episode with George Clooney, where Letterman makes a surprise visit to the Clooney home. Unlike many Netflix shows the entire season has not been released all at once."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,I like what I've seen so far,"One of the most recognizable faces on TV for three decades, David Letterman has been continuing his career on Netflix with ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman"". Unlike his previous shows, this one is not a slapstick comedy opening with commentary about the day's events, transitioning into short interviews with the guests. We have here hour-long interviews. Most importantly, while the interviews take place in one location, the guests show Letterman things and people of significance to them. Barack Obama took him to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, while George Clooney took him to meet an Iraqi refugee. I'll be eager to see what Malala Yousafzai has to show him.

Don't get me wrong. Letterman still has a joke or two up his sleeve. It's just that here we get to see his human side as opposed to Dave the goof-off. With a thick beard, he seems worlds away from the man recognizable from late night TV. I hope to see the remainder of the show. It looks to be fun."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Brilliant,Maybe the best show Letterman have ever done. A rock solid start with Mr Obama. Well done Letterman and keep up the good work in the following episodes.
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Lengthy discussions with interesting people in the public eye,I love the idea of a talk show revolving around natural conversation. The dialogue is interesting so I don't need the fireworks and insane showmanship to remain engaged which seems to be a big part of a lot of other shows. It has more of a talk radio feel and that leads to more in depth conversations which is missed now in the age of technology and short attention spans. Great variety of guests so far! :)
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,You May Like.,"I watched the obama episode, I expected it to be more fun, but it wasn't. It had a documentary-style content about the person's life, he was good at it."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Fantastic and educational,"I was looking for the next David Letterman show but what I got was so much more. Most of the guest are very informative and have taught me a lot, causing my to buy their books or whatever to learn more about them. The show is surprisingly emotional and might make you cry. People share their lives and the obstacles they've overcome with a positive message of how to help others. I didn't expect this and was pleasantly surprised.

Letterman is such a good interviewer, he lets the guest talk and doesn't interrupt them to share his own story or thoughts like Conan.

I really liked the people I didn't know anything about because I learned so much. The only bad one is Kayne. I like or liked him, I'm still not sure. But during the interview he is... well Kayne. He doesn't talk to David but instead the audience. And he doesn't really engage with a conversation. He has really lost his grip on reality and is lost in his celebrity world. He thinks his art can change the world and has lost sight of reality.

The Obama episode was great. Kinda bad to watch now in 2020 because it reminds me of how presidents should be. And how good we used to have it. I took this great man for granted at the time. I knew he was special but I didn't appreciate him how I should have. They're all really good and fascinating people. Tiffany Haddish was amazing and I had no idea who she was.

Thanks Dave for another great show."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,A FAR MORE RELAXED BUT ENGAGING FORMAT,"It should come as no surprise that this is Dave Letterman's element. A more or less free-form talk show. Unlike his more structured network shows, his personality comes through in more serious dialog and not just his signature humor. With a single guest, Dave has adopted a more conversational interview style. And the result is a more relaxed and engaging interview. Each interview is accompanied by related but much more personal clips than one expects from a typical talk show."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,It's all about David,David is so self indulgent in this show it's embarrassing. I have just watched four interviews and all he does is tell stories about himself and his son. He doesn't let the interviewee finish sentences. Doesn't ask any follow up or in depth questions and relies heavily on the fame of the guest to make a somewhat interesting show. It seems David has become a mediocre interviewer and should just leave the honor to himself and retire so we can remember him for the great man he is (was).
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Letterman the interviewer,"People have forgotten that David Letterman, behind the facade of the funny guy, always was a serious interviewer -perhaps not as punchy as Jon Stewart, but still pretty good. Always well prepared, knowing his facts, and having pointed questions. This new show is all about about having an in-depth conversation with the guest. Letterman did a pretty good job in the first episode. He was helped by the chart-topping quality of his first guest: Barack Obama. But if you listen carefully, the conversation was not random or free-flowing. It was carefully scripted, with civil rights and the Selma march -and the role of Congressman John Lewis- a central topic of discussion. Like a shadow commentary on current affairs -and the 45th President- without naming names or current events, only references to historical events that matter. This central piece was showcased within the context of pleasant and relaxed small talk and personal anecdotes, Letterman and Obama displayed a warm rapport, and the conversation was pleasant and interesting. This made the first episode very good viewing. I am concerned that guests in future episodes may not have equally compelling stories to tell. Hence the rating, as the interest of the show is dependent on the performance and personality of the guest, not Letterman. I anticipate I may watch some future episodes, but maybe not all."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,How Fantastic is Dave Really?,"Depending on your age, you may not know Dave's history as a comedian. Since he's been gone from late night TV, we get a sharper look at his genius and compelling talent through this series of Netflix shows. Every episode brings someone bigger than life and nearly an hour of their life story and/or accomplishments with Dave's one of a kind crafty wit drawing out the scenery in a way that makes one realize how spectacularly talented Letterman truly is, and how much he's missed. I found every guest at least a 10 for intriguing, with one exception, and Dave always a 10. This is a rare taste of post Late Night talent you really shouldn't miss. It's unlike what you might expect and more heartfelt than I can describe. I've watched the Obama episode 3 times and others twice. The Jay-Z episode didn't seem to connect like the others but I'd rate the other episodes high enough that the average would still be a 10. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this gem. See how you'd rate it. No doubt you'll enjoy though. This is the end of Season 1 with 7 episodes and I really hope there's another season planned!"
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,rich and rewarding,"David Letterman was and is a generational talent. As the era of the single late night host came to an end with Carson's retirement and Dave's subsequent departure from his network, he ushered in a change to the industry he was a leading voice of. Now, in the twilight of his career, Dave reveals what a singular talent he is by bringing something to entertainment that is simultaneously new and fresh and reminiscent of the past.

There have been, of course, numerous long-form deep dive interview shows throughout the years. And it's not uncommon for entertainers and newscasters who find themselves retired from their primary careers but with a lifetime of contacts and experience and the energy to use it, to start a slower-paced but more informative interview show. What's different here is that Dave conducts his interviews as almost a documentary that has been chopped down to something more condensed, something that is a representation of his mind and experiences from meeting people.

It isn't just about the subject of the interview or the interview itself. The show brings together cuts of Dave meeting people in their homes, in their parents homes, at their workplaces, etc., and splices it together with Dave exploring the environment around his guests, Dave warming his audience with teasers about the guest, and the interview itself. It's all mixed together with an internal logic that comes from his mind; a reflection of his personality, his sharp comedic wit, and how he sees his guest in a larger context.

Interview questions might seem bizarre and nonsensical, such as asking what his guest had for breakfast, only to lead to a deeper discussion about the medications that person takes and the conditions surrounding it. Or he might ask a young woman about school and going to classes and school games that sounds like a conversation you might have with your grandfather, only to have that merge with a discussion of a traumatic event on a school bus earlier in her life. And you begin to see this logic emerging about how Dave himself sees this person: as a young woman full of potential and intellect and passion who survived this horrific ordeal that he would almost rather not think about, but does because he's amazed at her perseverance and her resemblance to other young woman her age.

Interview questions can jump topics abruptly or include a short monologue about himself or seamlessly drift in and out of previous footage so that you have to pay attention to the broader logical thread, because you are inside his mind now. The logic is his logic and you are only along for the ride. It is an old master's prerogative: he isn't selling you anything, he is letting you tag along and he hopes you will enjoy the experience but he will not coddle you.

And the guests all seem to get this, even the truly powerful and successful ones. They let him steer the ship because they sense that being there is as much their privilege as having them is his. Dave sporting an insane Methuselah beard, wearing comfortable clothes, and asking inane and sometimes even lightly mocking questions is still Dave. Poor health and a different technological and entertainment landscape robbed the previous generation of Carson's graceful bow, but we are fortunate enough to get Letterman.

So yah, it's a rich and rewarding show and well worth watching. It won't spoon feed the interview the way late night television interviews have to, but you'll get an experience with one of televisions most complex, fascinating, and flawed personalities and a once in a generation talent."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Pleasantly suprised.,"These interviews really show the human side of these celebrities. Only someone with David Letterman's reputation and the respect people feel for him, could bring out the warmth. I was a huge fan of James Lipton and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy these interviews."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,"Very easy going and chill format, enjoyed it a lot","This is not a late night show like he used to do, the format is more relaxed and open. David has still got it, and its not just about comedy its beyond that.

Loved the episodes with Obama, Clooney and Shah Rukh Khan."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,It's an opened door chit chat...,"This show is beautiful, that's a simple, but on point word for this show.

It's not your typical late show in cable, i don't even think it's a late show. There's not a real format, but it's more like David invites friend, who is also a celebrity of course, and has with them a normal conversation: work, like, passions, future, past. And we can watch that chatting between the two and although not really part of it physically, you get involved since it's such an intimate spot.

If you like David Letterman this is just more of his brilliant, fluent, smart mind. Actually, it's just that, a dark spot enlightened by him and his guests."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,"FU to THE "" critics""",This is not the late show...part 2 The show is like a formal podcast with an audience where Dave has an honest human to human conversation with moments of humor in it ( you know like normal conversation have) Giving you greater insight to the individual he's interviewing. ITS a brilliant show and I can't wait for season 3 especially Dave Chappelles episode
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,So many good guests but stop interrupting,Letterman has so many good guests on his show but I wish he would stop interrupting them with his stories. I'd not want to hear home talk I want to hear the guests.
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,This is not any-other show !,Cheerful ! Heart touching ! Very pleasant ! Very uplifting and inspiring .
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Dave was and still is the best. Great series.,"Such a great interview/talk show. It's so good to see Dave back doing what he does best. His ability to use humor and honesty to put people at ease is delightful and engaging. He can take the most uptight, self-obsessed celebrity and almost immediately bring them down to earth with the rest of us. Dave has aged beautifully. Highly-recommended show. 👍🏼💯"
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,If you gave it a 7 or lower your a trump supporter,"It is obvious the haters that rate this are Republicans, Gang members of a Gang that is a dying party! The Republican ship is sinking so are the Democrats! Financial Oligarchy is the reason of thier destruction and David Letterman just proves it with his interviews indirectly! People speaking honestly proves what America really wants not what the Politcal Parties want you to want. This show is so amazing I found myself laughing so hard, David Letterman should run as a Independant President of the United States! That or Elyn Degenrous. I am invested emotionally on this show and I hope they have 10 more seasons of this show because there are so many influential people that needs to be interviewed openly. It proves we dont need music or branding of a product or a bunch of fake laughs to get people to watch! Netflix is not about that they are about documentaries and having there own unique programs and selling thier monthly subscriptions! I love Netflix! If PBS ever collapsed due to finance I hope Netflix will buy it out and keep it going forever. Thank you David Letterman for coming out of retirement and have my mind working again! My brain is on fire! I cant believe how you influenced me so much now I need to put those thoughts into action."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,Real Uplifting Conversations,"This is one of my favorite pieces of art I've watched. It's so real. It's David letterman having a real conversation about someone's life with the people that interest him, and me/others, the most. There are scenes filmed with their families/coworkers that are inserted into the interview that teach you more about the person. No episode feels like an interview. All of them are a peer having a conversation about their life and how they have changed the world. I would say there is no ego, but they are all famous and have their own platforms, but it doesn't feel pretentious. Everyone seems grateful for their current position and it's always guests that are doing great things for the greater world. I usually watch one at a time maybe after the news or late at night but it always feels uplifting and there are a lot of laughs throughout the reality. Simply amazing. I'm very glad this series is out in the world. Thank you to David Letterman and all his guests for the positive energy this series exudes."
My Next Guest with David Letterman and Shah Rukh Khan,"Intimate, insightful, and very entertaining.","While it doesn't contain a lot of the trademark craziness of Letterman's older talk shows, My Next Guest functions well as an insightful and interesting series. His interviews with Obama, George Clooney, and Howard Stern in particular are among my favorites. Combine that with a great score by Paul Shaffer, My Next Guest is definitely a Netflix original worth checking out."

Part-Time Idol,Polish What Others Cast Away °5.7 °good° 💯%🔍,"Why part-time? Performers don't work full-time. Yet these kids work hard to get to their first release, and that is just the beginning.

Jung Tae Kyung is a wildly successful and famous music producer (think Dr. Dre or Phil Spector) that retires after questioning what it all means. He was lost, he explains later. As the show starts, he knows where to go again. He's back in the studio parking lot looking like a wandering peasant that got lost from the set of a historical drama - turban and all. He's been cloistered at a Hindu temple for 8 years, so he's almost like a newborn. Lowkey? He pees sitting down, now! {He grandstands to his partner: ""How many changes can the world have within the span of 8 years? Has NK developed nuclear missiles? Has AI taken over Go? Why make a big fuss as if the nation has been turned upside down?"" The answer: 'NK does have nukes, AI has overtaken Go, and our country did turn upside-down due to impeachment.' Dude was spared all that anxiety by living in a Hindu Temple. There's something to be said for that}

Like a person that has sincerely turned h/h life around by way of faith, he immediately gravitates to the lost causes at the agency: A pathetic attention seeker, a girl with stage fright (she's an excellent singer - alone - in the bathroom), another girl who suddenly can't hit the high notes anymore (she will draw first blood), and a very talented missy with a personality too hissy - anger management issues to boot. This motley crew is gathered into a room where they surmise that the agency has decided to fire them. Next, HE enters. ""I'm going to make you idols,"" he announces. ""Who are you?,"" they ask.

PTI is a 2017 release that is rated 7.4 on MAL. It is 1 season consisting of 5 35-minute episodes, so it's about the length of a long movie. This appears to be a show that's geared towards the young-at-heart. It has simple plot lines, writing, characters, and very simple solutions. Problems are wrapped up in an afternoon, the bad guys give up easily (not wanting to be /that/ evil) and the group becomes like family. It's shallow, but it's all in good clean fun, and it's a nice escape for young teens and tweens. Adults take a condescending attitude towards things that are simple, but complicated ain't better. For kids everything is simple. Don't lie. Don't steal. Be kind. Forgive. As adults we know the world is more complicated than that... Why? Did lying, stealing, and meanness suddenly become okay, or are we making all sorts of compromises to manage the world and justify doing what we want to do? Things are usually simple, and kids often have it right. It's adults that cast shadows on things. In PTI we'll meet a guy who chose the wrong path. He decided to betray his friend and the whole company in order for profit and power, but he relented when it got to a certain point. Instead of staying on the course he had chosen, he backed up and did not go-for-the-win-to-the-bitter-end. Is it more childish to stick with our bad decisions and try to win at all costs, or is it more childish to simply stop and reconsider?

The art direction lightens the mood. In ep1 when they show up at their new digs, their wardrobe and suitcases create a cacophony of color that assaults the eyes, yet somehow lightens the mood. Some of the music is pretty good. One would think that's automatic, but we've all seen features about the music industry in which the music isn't good, so good for them. PTI only manages mild humor; The bathroom humor misses the target in ep2. The cast are all young and beautiful, and not merely cookie-cutter pretty. Lee Su Hyun is not waif thin and her head is 50% larger than the ones of rest of the cast, yet she is beautiful. Her smile is radiant starlight, and her jet-black straight hair is the type that I've always found most alluring. She evokes a gentleness and genuine spirit that comes from within.

In summary, PTI is quite a bit like pop music: It's sweet, simple, and it sticks to the surface. Sometimes that's exactly what we need.

Age 10+ with this caution: The topic of suicide is introduced. This creates a good opportunity to discuss it with your kids, as the painful aftermath never fully resolves. SK, a country of around 50M people, is overachieving on the world stage. One reason for that is because their society is so heavily pressured. Common themes in SK entertainment are: Study, exams, domineering parents, expectations, a rigid caste system where many are shut out, vicious gossip, and suicide. All of this exists everywhere, but SK is a hothouse where it really thrives resulting in the 4th highest suicide rate in the 🌏, w/ students & elderly @ 🔝risk. The rest of the developed 🌎 isn't close. This is, quite simply, a pride problem. ""Asian mother"" has become a cliche for a toxic parent because of the way kids are pressured to elevate the family and make everyone look good. There's kids that are self-motivated, and kids that need a little help. Our son needed to be pushed every step of the way. The key is that it's always supposed to be about the child, what is good for the child, what will assist that human in developing into the best version of h/hself. The goal is supposed to be helping that person realize h/h potential in order to live the fullest life. It's never supposed to be about making the parents or the family look good. That's a poison that not only rots the family, but also the community, leaving destruction in its wake. Thus the suicide. In 🇺🇸 we have the opposite problem, having become a country of mindless, rutting underachievers. Too many parents are too absorbed with their own lives, leaving the kids floundering and aimless. Thus, the problems we have. Feeling nothing but a bleak emptiness has kids in the USA sacrificing their lives to reckless pursuits in an effort to escape meaninglessness. Balance is hard, because humans have a tendency to take things too far. Not being balanced naturally, we must make a constant effort to walk the sunlit path. The first stepping stone on the path has this inscription: ""It's not about you and what you can get from this. It's about love."" The more love you invest, the more love is returned. While always kind, love isn't always soft, though. Love does the necessary things. It's about shaping this person into a hard working, caring, beneficial member of society. Then love multiplies.

The Swimmers,"The world needs movies like this, with messages like this","This movie touched me deeply. The Swimmers is a story about humanity, perseverance, love and hope. About family. In the realest way. The fact that all of this happened is unbelievable, and the fact it happened and keeps happening so much (meaning war and refugees) is heartbreaking to me. In our western world we tend to forget. So I'm grateful for this movie to bring forward this message. Even more grateful to have done this in such a beautiful and respectful way. The script is amazing, the cinematography is amazing and so are the actors. This is my first IMBd review and I just had to write it."
The Swimmers,Swim for those who died at sea...,"... trying to find a new life. Most of us reading this thankfully live in stable democracies in which the biggest concerns of our lives are inflation, rising interest rates and ever bigger mortgages. We do not really stop to consider others whose lives are upended or stymied by war, genocide and ruthless dictators. Some of us even cast a wary glance at refugees, asylum seekers and even ordinary migrants because they had the apparent audacity to seek a better life in our countries and take our jobs (even if these are jobs no one wanted in the first place, as the COVID-19 pandemic proved).

Although it is not a cinematic masterpiece, The Swimmers tell an ample tale about the dreams and aspirations of every human being regardless of which country or family they are born into; they desire safety, shelter, community and, above all, an environment that supports their growth and allows them to find purpose and meaning in this universe. We all have but a short span of time on this planet and we should thank our lucky stars if we do not have to negotiate psychopathic and narcissistic leaders like Bashar al-Assad who put their own selfish interests before their nation's."
The Swimmers,"The Tides of Tyranny, Turmoil & Torment...","It's a wonderful story sees two girls become women, when they're forced to up sticks from the place they've been living, as conflict and turmoil takes grip in their land, and democracy, freedom and liberties canned, fighting tides and head winds as they travel with others, who have similar tales of opportunities smothered, with hope and belief that the city of Berlin, will be their spring board, and allow them to swim.

The brave and courageous story of the tenacious Mardini sisters and their cousin Nizar, as they make the perilous journey from Syria to Germany in search of a new life and for one, the hope to swim at the Rio Olympics. Beautifully performances and genuinely inspiring."
The Swimmers,I hated this film...,"..for how much it made me cry. A beautiful film. Well told. I'm sure there was a lot more heartache and joy in their journey, but this was phenomenal to be able to fit into the length of a feature.. and no buts, purely a fantastic film. Kudos to the director, editors, and everyone involved. I wish to know everyone's story from their particular journey. I know many have had to do this trip and many didn't make it. Inspiring. IMDB is making me write more, but I don't mind just repeating how great this film is. I look forward to seeing more films directed by Sally El Hosaini and writing by her as well."
The Swimmers,Awe-inspiring if slightly overlong film based on true story,"As ""The Swimmers"" (2022 release from Turkey; 135 min) opens, we are in ""2011, a suburb of Damascus, Syria"", and we get to know sisters Yursa and Sara, whose father is also their swim coach. We then go to ""2015, Four Years Later"", and the civil war in Syria is destroying everything. Yursa and Sara, now 17 yo, decide to flee Syria, accompanied by their cousin. At this point we are less than 15 minutes in the movie.

Couple of comments: this is the latest from Welsh-Egyptian director Sally El Hoisani (""My Brother The Devil). Here she brings the true story of the Mardini family, in particular Yursa and Sara, who are competitive swimmers. The film is really several movies into one: the dramatic journey these sisters, and many more like them, were taking that particular year (2015) to escape the living hell that was (is) Syria. There are no words, frankly. (You may recall that when Germany was confronted with wave after wave of refugees, then=Chancellor Angela Merkel famously declared ""wir schaffen das"", ""we can handle this"". One of the most courageous political decisions by a Western leader EVER.) The film also brings the account of Yusra as the underdog swimmer trying to reach the 2016 Olympics, at reminding of being ""Rocky"" for swimming. Last but not least, the film also reminds us that these refugees are first and foremost people like you and me, going up against impossible situations and circumstances of life. The film is a little long for its own good, but it's a minor complaint. Yusra and Sara are played by real life sisters Nathalie and Manai Issa.

""The Swimmers"" had a limited US theatrical run earlier this month, and it started streaming on Netflix just a few days ago. The movie is currently rated 82% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. If you have any interests in understanding why it is that millions upon millions of people have fled Syria over the last decade and what they go through to try and reach safety in Europe, or if you are looking for a good underdog story set in the world of competitive swimming, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
The Swimmers,What is wrong with us humans?,"I needed to give this movie 9 stars out of 10, because it has such an important message. What are we doing with our world? Why do we let greed divide us? Why is it so important to wage war around every corner?

This is an eye opening experience. To hear about refugees crossing the oceans in little boats and visually seeing what can happen is very different. Obviously it is very hard to get every suffering soul into Europe or the US, there are just too many, but this is why it is even more important to bring education and wealth into every corner of the world.

It is important to have movies about fantasies, about princesses, about interesting stories, but it is maybe even more important to shine the light on unspeakable circumstances. So thanks a lot for this movie, thank you for a beautiful performance from the Issa sisters and thank you for human beings like the Mardini sisters."
The Swimmers,Struggles to relay actual drama,"The story has everything you'd ever need to inspire young and old.

There's just something missing.

That something is that the screenplay, direction and chosen edit feel like a glossy magazine - not a gutsy drama.

The treatment of the subject matter is misguided at best.

Then when the director realises that there are massive lulls in the story it's jazzed up with some Hollywood-like plasticity just to keep a pulse going.

The story itself is moving, definitely. The casting and acting near perfect.

It's just difficult to understand how with all the industry experience for bringing incredible tales like this to the screen that the audience is subjected to the incredible stretches of outright boredom when there's all this material to choose from.

It's a real shame because the tale itself is mind blowing."
The Swimmers,It opened my eyes,"Started to watch this film without knowing anything about it, only that it was trending at number 3 on Netflix. I usually switch films off with subtitles but something about this one lured me in. The balance of spoken English and subtitles actually worked for me as the film is about people attempting to cross International borders not all of them speaking the same language.

I was, from the title expecting to see a story about 2 sisters training to be Olympic swimmers. And yes it is, but it's not a feel good story, it is the remarkable true story of a refugee achieving an Olympic dream. Living in my cosy U. K. bubble I had no concept of living in a war torn country and how that drives young people to risk their lives in order that their families can seek refuge in other countries and it has really opened my eyes.

Lesbos was one of my favourite holiday destinations but in the last decade I have begrudgingly avoided it because of refugees landing on it's beaches . I now feel humbled after watching the harrowing depiction of the 'boat' journey. Part way through I almost stopped watching as their journey made me feel more and more uncomfortable as this wasn't going to be a story with a completely happy ending.

There is also an insight into the conditions that refugees live in once they have arrived in Germany. Although not ideal thank goodness there are compassionate countries.

The film felt authentic as there were no big stars in the cast and it seemed credible that they were refugees (the only actor I recognised was the one who played a good looking Doctor in The Good Karma Hospital).

I think there should be more films made from the point of view of refugees as their story needs to be told."
The Swimmers,I was lucky,"I did not know this story. It is very powerful and deserves to be told. I really enjoyed the performance of the Mardinis and I was glad to learn that they are sisters also in real life. Before watching it, you should consider that It is not an easy movie: a couple of times it is like a punch in the stomach. However I strongly recommend the vision. It is not easy to find a film on this subject that does not fall into stereotypes. The movie achieve its goal well and it helps you to exercise the empathy muscle. Several times I thought that I was very lucky to be born in a certain part of the world."
The Swimmers,"truly a great story, must watch","It's movie on a story about refugees something that the world has been ignoring from a long time. It's a tough subject to create such a movie and do justice to the autobiography of the swimmers. The movie has many emotional points, I found it inspiring and moving too as opposed to few reviews that said it's not inspiring. I didn't find it long as well. Just keep going on if you feel it's streching then skips 10 seconds but I am sure that won't be needed. Enjoy this movie and pray for peace and stability across the world. I wish more such movies are made so the world can watch and support the refugees."
The Swimmers,super manipulation,"The movie that I'm taking a break at the 60th minute right now.

I was honestly expecting a biased movie before I started, but until now it's nothing but a disgrace.

Our Turks left the refugees to die. When the boat broke down, they called the Turkish police, but the Turks said they could not come. There was no Greek coast guard along the way. Whereas, the Greek owner security strips the refugees naked, takes their money from their pockets, blows their boots and leaves them to die. Lucky ones can come back.

When people arrived in greece, they welcomed them, gave them food, new clothes, shoes. They're walking around waving their arms right now. They come to the beach and enjoy the sea and the sun with their swimsuits. The only word I want to say as of the 60th minute is a super manipulation.

If so, why do we have millions of refugees? Look, not a hundred, not a thousand, not ten thousand, not a hundred thousand, not millions, not millions.

If so, how many million refugees are there in Greece? How many hundred thousand? How many thousand? How many hundred?

Let's share our bread with millions of refugees again, no worse than us. European paradise. They seriously said welcome. They gave food, clean clothes, clean shoes. Then they sent a special bus and went to Germany with that special bus. It was also a real life story. Let them love your lie."
The Swimmers,Find your lane. Swim your race,"With bombs and soldiers swarming around their home in Damascus, sisters Yusra and Sara decide to flee to Europe in pursuit of a better life. As highly competitive swimmers the girls were training to compete in the Olympics. Now instead of swimming in a pool, Yusra and Sara are trying out the Mediterranean. Other obstacles threatening to pull them under include a broken-down raft overloaded with passengers, barbed wire fences, dogs, police, and criminals eager to profit from desperate refugees. Still, the greatest currents that they are swimming against are in themselves.

This miraculous true story sheds light on a pressing global issue. Over 6 million refugees fled from Syria since 2011. Following the story of Yusra and Sara helps us to understand the issues that refugees face. The actors are sisters in real life, so their chemistry is authentic and comes from spending a lifetime together. It is heartwarming to witness Yusra and Sara holding onto life and their love for each other. The filmmakers are no slouches themselves, and there are some amazing scenes including a dance sequence in an empty warehouse."
The Swimmers,The Mardini sisters deserved better.,"A story like this has the ability to pull at your heartstrings and make your soul weep, to wonder how the world turned so cruel and be grateful for everything you have, The Swimmers missed on that opportunity. They made the protagonist a little too entitled and arrogant and while I understand she was young, I highly doubt she wasn't aware of the situation in her country and the sacrifices everybody around her made.

Overall though, the movie had some good shots, one that particularly stood out to me was the bombing while they danced in a high-rise, unaware the revolution had begun, which I imagine might have been the situation for many, the suddenness of live changing overnight. It's a good movie, it just had the promise of being much better.

Anyway, if you have read any of my other reviews, you'd know I'm a crier, but while this movie made me think, it didn't make my breaths shallow and let my mind travel in grief, it kept me there, watching some sports shots that didn't add to the movie."
The Swimmers,"Shows the process of refugees, but Hollywoodized.","Interesting movie, beginning was very dragged out. They did show that the refugees go through a lot. But barely showed the bad side of the smugglers. Of course it's not the case every-time but these people are ripping people off, raping, sex trafficking, drug smuggling etc. They need to show to people that smuggling and becoming a criminal by going illegally into other countries is a criminal offense. At the end made the sister a hero... The girls are very arrogant and entitled. Should have shown them, incorporating into Germany and learning German. This is a sad reality, going on. Everywhere."
The Swimmers,Much needed & fantastic movie on a very important subject,"I have never written a review here before, but this movie compelled me to do so for the first time. It brilliantly covers a very tough subject... that of refugees fleeing war torn countries under very risky & dangerous methods just hoping for a better & safer life. How folks could deny any refugee something so basic as water after coming to shore is beyond comprehension. It really drives home the need to have compassion for these refugees, as we are so lucky to live in the safe countries that we do. The acting is superb as well as the manner it was directed giving us glimpses into the emotions & thoughts in the refugees' minds through flashbacks of their journey to safety & the personal experiences of destruction & loss through war in their home countries. This movie is not easy to watch emotionally much of the time, but that difficultly is nothing compared to what these refugees have experienced. My only hope is that this movie will open up many hearts & minds to the plight of refugees for those that are against giving them safe refuge. We are all people and the lucky ones of us should recognize our good fortune and translate it to much care and assistance to those that aren't so fortunate."
The Swimmers,Should have been inspiring but no.,"There is much to like about this film - the acting is natural, the script disciplined. But dull. Very dull. The camera work by Christopher Ross is awful; it's shaky and unsure how to keep its subjects in frame. While the story is incredible, it is not realized here. The characters don't involve us the way they should do. Same for the editing, which is jumpy and unnatural, even jarring at times. There's simply too much hanging around and talking, missing the opportunity to weave a tale to involve us.

Instead, we feel outside the narrative, not fully understanding the complexity of emotions and motivations of the characters, other than the obvious will to survive. Mardini's story - and that of refugees - deserves better."
The Swimmers,Great Movie,"I've watched it twice already and what a great job they did making this! Finally a perspective of the realities of Western negligence when it comes to asylum seekers. This movie is motivational, stressful, heart wrenching/ heart warming and the fact the real life women are now facing prosecution from Greece for aiding asylum seekers and are facing up to 20 years in prison is something that should be talked about and condemned widely. For more information on that situation you can check out free humanitarians on Instagram. The actors also deserve all the praise because they did an amazing job. Refugees/ Asylum seekers have been through some of the worst conditions and many don't make out alive. People fleeing unsafe conditions from non European countries are constantly neglected and it's time we have more movies like this amplifying the stories of these people. Great job to everyone involved in the making of this movie. 10/10 would definitely recommend!"
The Swimmers,Poignant and exciting!,"""The Swimmers"" is an impressive film that tells the long and arduous journey of the two Syrian sisters Yusra and Sara in opulent images.

From war-torn Damascus to promised Germany, the two young women have to put up with a lot of effort and as a viewer you get a realistic impression of what refugees in this world have to do so that they can see a better future in another country.

The camera is outstanding and the acting is great.

If you want to criticize the film for something, it's that the cause of the war in Syria isn't even addressed. The formerly modern and Western country was catapulted back to the Middle Ages by the influence of Islam, like Iran before it."
The Swimmers,"powerful, gripping, beautifully done, compelling and important story","Beautiful, deeply moving, and thought-provoking film. The dialogue and performances felt completely authentic. The story was compelling from start to finish. The subject matter is obviously rather awful and it was sometimes painful to watch the suffering of these characters who seemed so real (and in fact were real), yet there was also so much humor and grit and so many moments of unexpected joy that the film never felt bleak. As a lap swimmer (though not a good one), I felt that the director and cinematographer really captured how compelling swimming -- a sport that might seem dull from the outside -- can be. It would be easy for a film like this to be mawkish, or bleak, or overwhelming, or preachy, but it was none of these things. Wonderful film. I hope it wins heaps of oscars."
The Swimmers,An Inspiring Chronicle,"There's something truly inspiring about beating seemingly impossible odds, accomplishments that stir our emotions and may even produce a significant adrenalin rush. Such are the feelings evoked in writer-director Sally El Hosaini's new fact-based chronicle about a pair of sisters (Nathalie Issa, Manal Issa) who fled war-torn Syria as refugees to find their way to sanctuary in Germany. But, if that weren't enough in itself, the younger sibling - a lifetime competitive swimmer - managed to land a spot on the Refugee Olympic Team to compete in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro games. While this BAFTA Award nominee for Best British Film runs a little long (especially in the depiction of the sisters' flight to freedom), the picture nevertheless shines a bright light on the global refugee crisis (and not just among those fleeing Syria) and what's attainable when we set our minds to it. This Netflix offering certainly delivers an uplifting message, as well as a candid look at sibling relationships and how they evolve over time. Admittedly, the picture tends to be somewhat formulaic at times, but its compelling story and creative cinematography do much to sell the film as a genuine crowd-pleaser, one that's particularly empowering to girls, young women and those who dare to dream big in the face of potentially insurmountable challenges."
The Swimmers,Larger than life true stories always win!,"Had the privilege to attend the European premier of the movie which will come to Netflix on 23rd of November. The movie is a very nicely paced dramatization of an amazing human achievement and story, it's amazing because of the nature how far they came along and its amazingly human because they've did it sheerly as human beings nothing more. You could even profanely say as ""superheroes"" to quote the movie directly. Nothing super fancy directing and editing here, just purely nice narration and sequencing of events dramatization and this is being done nicely by the director Sally El Hosaini. But the real magic and chemistry lies between the two lead actresses Manal and Nathalie Issa who are siblings in real life as well not just on the screen; this chemistry between them gives you the passionate punch which delivers effectively indeed. This movie is definitely an underdog testament, a very good one."
The Swimmers,The Swimmers,"Two young sisters - Sara (Manal Issa) and Yusra (Nathalie Issa) are obsessed with representing their Syrian nation at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016. Their father is their coach and their mentor, and he drives them hard - but that might all prove to be for nought when a bomb comes crashing through the roof of their swimming pool and only narrowly avoids killing someone! Scared but determined, the family decide to enlist the help of their charismatic cousin Nizar (Ahmed Malek) and armed with some borrowed cash try to get from their home to Germany where they hope to find safety and continue their training. Thing is, they have no papers so after a brief flight to Istanbul, find themselves in the hands of the people smugglers who care little for their safety. Much of this interesting film is quite tough to watch, as it depicts the efforts of the three to beat the elements and the authorities to reach their goal - at times at quite considerable risk to themselves. It's all based on a true story so there is no actual jeopardy to their journey, but it is illustrative of just how perilous the whole process is; of how venal and exploitative some people can be of those in life-threatening predicaments and also of just how persevering the human spirit can be when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. It features a fine supporting effort from ""Sven"" (Matthias Schweighöfer) and offers us quite a well produced and paced observation on just how these two girls got through their ordeal. The photography is frequently intimate and that sometimes exposes us to the character traits of the girls that are less attractive to the viewer - but somehow that added to the authenticity of this compelling dramatisation that defiantly opens the eyes!"
The Swimmers,Need to be told and watched.,"I started watching this after zapping through like 10+ slick Hollywood movies on Netflx's trending suggestions. I've seen all the usual comic-book inspired movies, and other mainstream movies. But am getting a bit saturated with them. Looking at other offerings - more drama like - they started of good, but I couldn't get through them after about a quarter way through. Some were too art-house - blaberring 1st-world problems - yacking away at frivirolous things that were supposed to be funny. Some tried to be dramatic and overly dark - oh yes, those dark treatment of classic stories especcially fairy tales. C'mon can we leave our childhood alone already.

Then I came across this title. The autoplay of Netflix looks interesting, and I started watching. It definitely gripped me as I watched it, eventhough it was at times dragging. There were many arcs, storylines that, in a Hollywood movie would likely have been edited out to keep the pace of the movie going. There were some parts which were cliched, and you knew it was to contrast with the sadness that's about to come.

However, I still was enticed enough to keep getting through it. After the movie ended, it was clear that some scenes had to be shown, if at the risk of dragging, and prologing the movie to show descriptively the refugess situation with realism, and also of how a country (Syria in this case) descends into chaos.

The movie is authentic. The actors are dual lingual. They speak Arabic and English in mixed form. Being the middle class Syrians that they are, they are not depicted in the usual hijab covered demure helpless, if suppressed damsels. They are what many city muslims in Arab, and sadly what used to be more progressive and old midlle-eastern countries are like.

The usual religious stereotypes are refreshingly not in the movie, perhaps its because the director herself is from there. The movie concentrates on the plight of refugees experienced - even through a middle class, if not, elite Syrians such as the girls and their father who was himself a national athlete had to go through.

Watch it - I have new appreciation for refugees now."
The Swimmers,Good,"The summary on Netflix just mentioned that it's an award winning movie so I didn't know that it was based or inspired by a true story. And when I found out, I was in both in awe of these 2 sisters and the other refugees for having gone through this, and angry that there were so many people who would take advantage of them and make a profit off of them. The way that the smugglers took their money and left them to fend for themselves or stranded really upset me but it's reality for these refugees who are trying to flee their country for a better and safer life.

I liked the pacing of the movie and I was so glad when they finally reached Berlin together. And when the swimming coach gave Yusra a chance, that was when the tone of the movie became lighter and there was a lot more hope in the characters. Overall, a good movie and an eye opener to what refugees go through."
The Swimmers,It should've been released in theatres but it's Netflix,"DRAMA/ ADVENTURE

Co-written and directed by Sally El Hosaini with the movie based on fact of ""The Swimmers"" as the movie is called, is reference to two close-knit Syrian sisters of Yusra Mardini (Nathalie Issa) and her older sibling, Sara Mardini(Manal Issa) aspirations to become professional swimmers in the Olympics. Except that from the start of 2015 is when war began to hit their peaceful region putting their lives and everyone around them in jeopardy. Giving their dad, they both call Baba (Ali Suliman) to allow them to go on this journey with it's goal was to reach Germany. They do this with the help of their DJ cousin, Nizar (Ahmid Malik) before trekking with a group of other refugees that have similar situations from other countries and regions."

Robocar Poli,"Idiot plots and whining, but kids love it because talking vehicles","This show is made to sell toys. The plots rely on the characters being idiots for them to work. A lot of the characters spend a lot of time whining or acting really immature.

Basic plots are like this: someone whines about having to do something, and then everyone helps fix the problem. Someone intentionally ignores their friends, gets stuck in a jam, and everyone helps fix the problem. Someone feels sad, runs away, and everyone cheers them up.

It seems like they're attempting to teach the importance of friendship and emotional health, but it's just too shallow and caricatured too work."
Robocar Poli,Terrible,I hate it because it ripped off cars and transformers
Robocar Poli,the WORST modern kid show!,"I watched this a lot in 2018, and kind of forgot about it as time passed. But then I revisited it in late 2020, and omg, it's as bas as I remembered (even worse). Where to start?! The animation is very generic looking and the humans have weird shiny, plasticky flash, and the vehicles (while cool looking) ripoff Transformers entirely! The stories are very repetitive and predictable. Then there's the characters themselves. I thought Norman from Fireman Sam and Homer Simpson were stupid, but if you put them in this show, they'd seem very smart in comparison. The amount of stupid accidents is astounding and makes you wonder how this town actually works! It's HYSTERICAL how little everyone knows about common sense! Though the main character is a bit wiser than everyone else, he magically appears whenever someone is in trouble. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Now, I love kid shows and totally fine that not all of them can be Sesame Street. However, I want a show to have at least one thing that makes it special. The only positive thing about Robo Car Poli is how cringe it is. Overall, not as terrible as Rick and Morty or South Park (which have review of their own), but still not good. However, I like it because it's so bad. And one more thing; it tries os hard to be Paw Patrol. Not much more left to say, honestly."
Robocar Poli,The Best Kids Show You Will Ever See,"One of the best CGI cartoons I've ever watched, and I am in looooooove with this show. This show is meant for children and yet here I am, watching and waiting for the new seasons. I'd definitely love to watch season 5 eagerly waiting.

I grew up with amazing cartoons. A time when there was a good story, great animation, amazing theme songs. This certainly fulfilled these parts and exceeded my expectations. The 3D animation is done surprisingly well, and it's perfectly suited to the children who need to learn various values like, friendship and forgiveness which are very helpful for their emotional growth.

I really love this show, it's sooooo ""cute"" and all quite entertaining."
Robocar Poli,God Awful,"If you love your kids, don't let them watch this. It's pure rubbish. There is nothing educational about this cartoon. Maybe if I had left my brain at the living room door, it would make more sense. However, unfortunately I can't remove my brain. If I could, I might have enjoyed it. Unfortunately my son loves it, so I'm constantly subjected to it. I suppose the one positive is that it's innocent enough. I'm guessing it doesn't translate very well from the original Korean language. I'd rather watch six hours of Peppa Pig waxing lyrical about George's new dinosaur toy. And that says a lot, because I'm not too keen on her either.... P. S - I've deleted from my child's search profile so he can no longer access it!!."
Robocar Poli,Ignore the trolls in the other reviews,This show is really great for toddler-age children. My son loves to watch all the time. The characters are extremely likeable and convey excellent educational content. The animation is very toy-like which is actually a great quality for children to watch. The safety lessons are relatable for kids to learn at a young age. This show also contains funny and suspenseful qualities that make parents actually enjoy watching with their child. My kid plays with his toys pretending they are the Rescue Team and has a blast because this is his favorite show.
Robocar Poli,It's a very educational animation!,"It is a good program for young children to learn society easily through a day of robots and cars. Through this cartoon, our children can learn how to understand others, help others in need, and friendship. It also includes a variety of fun elements, such as a car transforming into a robot, so children can watch cartoons without getting bored. My child wants to be a strong and wonderful person like ROY. We hope to see more and better videos."
Robocar Poli,good,Very Great and fun. Makes me happy. Good to watch when bored.
Robocar Poli,Good education for toddlers,My son loves this show and as a parent I love the lessons it teaches him. The characters are great and very likeable. Some reviews claim it's a transformers rip off but this show is so much more. I'd recommend for all parents to introduce it to their little ones.
Robocar Poli,Educational and Fun!,"I don't understand all the angry and hateful reviews. It's a little kid's cartoon. Relax. The animation is colorful, smooth, and fun. It certainly grabs my son's attention, and there's always very good safety lessons within each episode of the show. What's not to like!? I enjoyed this cartoon so much as a middle-aged adult, that I bought a set of Transformer-like toys off Amazon so my son and I can play and discuss safety, manners, and citizenship. I've watched several episodes with my son, and while I can't say that I've seen every single one yet, I've never seen anything that was offensive, inappropriate, or inappropriate. Honestly, with how awful and cringy some kids shows are (I'm looking at you, Caillou), this is a welcome change. I find myself actually sitting down and enjoying watching the episodes with my son, because when the characters transform from vehicles into people and save the day, it's pretty freaking cool. Hahaha!"
Robocar Poli,Watched to kill time. Ending up enjoying a LOT.,"Don't read this if you don't want to. It's my opinion.

I'm literally 15 and watching this show mainly because I love the style and I love the problems the children manage to get into. It's just really funny on how they seem to be so dumb but that's what leads the episodes forward so it's fine. I'm busy laughing at titles like ""Don't play around in a parking lot."".

The negative reviews can be trashed because it's actually a pretty enjoyable show. It is just one of those kids shows that aren't unappealing to look at, the characters and scenarios they get into aren't terrible, and it's also something I can just sit down and watch. The reason I'm rating it an 8/10 is because the kids seem almost too dumb for their own good, but it doesn't get in the way of my enjoyment too much.

Just a note: for those saying this is a rip-off of Transformers, this show was obviously made with young kids in mind.. They took the trope of transforming vehicles but didn't directly rip-off Transformers. Not to mention that the transformations in this show are much simpler. Transformers change into cars to blend in while the cars in Robocar Poli transform to help people. SImple."

Human Resources,Well... at least they tried to do something different,"I get why some people might not like it... and I also get why other people might do it.

Recursos Humanos is an interesting project where you can notice that Jesús Magaña Vázquez had a lot of ideas... some of them worked, some others didn't.

The screenplay is both the strongest and the weakest element, the moments where this satirical movie works it works well, making you think about how close to real interactions this movie could be... until it overflows with exaggerations, that, in some cases are funny, but in others, the story rushes from one hysterical situation to other that it's hard to get the point of everything.

Despite of that, Pedro de Tavira does a very good job trying to portray all the shades of his character, and even when unfocused, it's great to see movie directors betting to take risks."

Mismatched,Something new,"I think this was cute binge, short and sweet. It surprisingly included a variety of characters and explored them well. Some parts were cringey and it isn't an award winning show for sure, but not as bad as people make it out to be."
Mismatched,Balanced but needs some fine tuning,I dont know why a lot of users are overly critical and rating it as 1 or 2 stars. I liked the story and how it progresses. There are certainly few letdowns but the narration keeps you engaged till the end. It very much is modern and to the point on college life. The actors have done their part and fit very well into their characters arcs however there is a learning curve. Overall its a good watch as opposed how some people say terrible.
Mismatched,Worst climax,"The way GOT disappointed its fans with a horrible ending, the same case is here. Though the series has some entertaining and enjoyable sequences, the climax ruins everything. The maker tried to add a hook for the next season maybe, but the ending ruined everything. No web series would have ended as terribly as this one did."
Mismatched,has to be the worst thing on netflix,Bunch of muppets running around on screen aimlessly. wasted 2 full episodes worth of time from my life. I felt drained after watching this cringy series. These guys are shown as 18 years old? woooottt? such bad script and superbly bad direction. extremely extremely bad direction. the guy with the american accent is like the last straw..
Mismatched,Light but not fresh,The series is not so fresh but light and digestible throughout but i wish they had clarity with their script. Climax is something incomplete and it makes you eager to wait for another season but if there won't be another season then it is something that will piss you off. There are a lot of things unexplained and so I'm waiting for second season to vlear all my doubts
Mismatched,Waste of time.,"That's not how you create a mobile app..😂😂 The teacher was teaching HTML essentials to create an app. I mean come on..🤣 The director must have been like I don't have money to do even an hour of research. I just want to add something cool like coding..

Such a bad ending oh my god.. Was the script writer a 6th grade boy having some weird fantasies..."
Mismatched,Very young and energetic,"Yet another good series on this weekend

The series is very young fresh and energetic it has nicely portrait the app making course.. the series is of the teenagers for the teenagers and the people who are ready to accept this generation and the way they are

Prajakta has played a fantastic role of a gamer well supported by Rohit and others

The ending was very thrilling and hence makes you eager for the next season"
Mismatched,Don't waste time on this,"Good start but after that makers had no clue what they are doing... Didn't like the way they portrait coders. Try watching Silicon Valley.

Climax is THE WORST ever - It will leave you so unsatisfied and in hate for the series"
Mismatched,Good start,Liked the series till the last episode. Ending was awful
Mismatched,Ok For the Timepass,"Plot is not so bad...but for some characters acting is quite poor.

They tried to make something different but at the end of the day same common college drama...!!"
Mismatched,3 hours that I am never getting back,"Personally I have always like Prajakta and her work very much. But this series was an absolute disgrace to her acting skills. Sorry Prajakta, I wish you found a better break! The story is non-sense and reflects poorly on the youth of today. It was good to see a girl fighting to enhance her life skills, and parents supporting all the way. The LGBTQ topic touches were decent. But so distasteful to see them all just sleeping around, and to conclude, the lead character breaks up a minute ago, and hooks up with another one. What a waste of time. Terrible. I feel terrible after watching this."
Mismatched,great show to kill quarantine time,Great show love to watch these type of shows just watch don't focus on these reviews u will not regret it after watching this show fast pace i think ending is not that good may be there is a second season.
Mismatched,"Cute and sweet, although not a different!","Mismatched is based on a book by Sandhya Menon ""when dimple meets Rishi"". The story isn't great but it has been well executed by the actors. Being typical college life Live stories, it might not create distinguished imprints in the minds of audience but it surely does some good watch work!"
Mismatched,time waste,"Dont waste your time even if its worthless to you, unless of course if you are an immortal even then please dont"
Mismatched,YouTubers should just stick to YouTube!,Hopeless and disappointing. Neither writing nor direction was anything worth a mention and worse of all the dumb YouTubers trying to be actors. Don't waste your time on this one.
Mismatched,Expecting more for new seasons,"Mismatched - Bollywood Drama Series Cast - Prajakta Koli, Rohit Suresh Saraf Season - 1

This is a teen drama series where some teenagers come to a institution to complete their software course. I enjoyed this one very much as I found so much similarities in this series. Various people have various stories, how they converge and rotates around a single circle is the key story focus of this series. The screenplay and ideas are so modern and relatable. Many funny, interesting, emotional touches were present in this series.

However, the series could be more interesting if they could draw attention to details more. I guess this is not very big planned series after all. Only one season broadcasted and hopefully more 1-2 seasons are comming. But this series could be lot bigger because of its plot. Due to keeping it small many interesting scenes were cut short and more interesting shots were easy to implement. Though it is a good series and I am waiting to see the next seasons.

Rating - 6.5/10 (Could be more)"
Mismatched,A directionless nonsense story with weak direction,Comentario no disponible
Mismatched,Flawed but sweet,"The tv show is a good watch unless you are watching with high expectations. Pros:
Different characters have different stories and their own shortcomings and strengths . Some of the characters got a chance to surface up.
The feeling or chemistry is not fully explained which creates a slight mystery as to where the relationship will go and the scenes are kept as such to give few hints and then deviate to other story
youth level show which showcase their sudden kindness and harsh behavior at times


Cons:"
Mismatched,Not even for timepass,"DON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT FOR TIMEPASS.

There is no plot... No research... Just made the show for employment. Worst acting by the cast... sets Unreal expectations. I mean wants to get married at the age of 21. Students at this age prepare for NEET JEE or NDA. And here the cast wants to get married because his grandparents got married at this age... SICK. And the same facial expression throughout the series by Prajakta Koli aka Mostly Sane.

Poor judgement by Netflix in content selection."
Mismatched,Its pretty good to make a grown up cry,"Idk why it has so low rating but guys, 2nd season is just lit. It makes you feel butterflies and makes you cry. I am literally not into hindi shows much but this is too cute! Prajakta's acting is too good. Those panic attacks made me cry so much. This season I'm surely crushing on Harsh (Vihaan), and Rohit he is way too cute. I loved the unspoken romance between karim and Rannvijay. The music, each and every song is to die for. Aise kyu by Rekha Bhardwaj is so freaking addictive. So so beautiful. It has so much to offer. I loved it. Give it a chance. Don't be so harsh on a show without watching. Y'all can suck at your job too. I hope your boss criticizes you someday so that you would know."
Mismatched,Spoiled by last scene,Overall storyline is good along with cast and screenplay. Characters are well defined except couple who violate their defined personality which disturbs the storyline. Specifically last scene of series is just disgusting taking away all good shown till that point. Main lead is shown so dull compared to others confusing audience who is real lead. Just need to change few scenes to make it a perfect series.
Mismatched,Every trending video is not gold,Worst. Why Netflix approved it to be in there platform clearly shows there weak judgements in content picking.
Mismatched,Took my heart away,I really liked the show. It was my first Indian Netflix Original show and I was completed swayed by it. Hope there's a 2nd season. I wanna know what happens between the leads and the supporting characters. It left us with a lot of cliffhangers.
Mismatched,Will the mismatched ever match?,"This cute, nerdy adolescent love story passes through myriad lanes of tests and trials. As the name of the webseries suggests, the protagonists are completely opposite to each other- with one using her head and the other his heart. At a young age, while a Jaipur guy dreams of finding his life partner following the path of his grandmother and her successful marriage, the Ambala girl is too ambitious and is focused on achieving a name for herself. The idea given behind starting early into relationships is to get to know each other for 2-3 years before marriage. Yet, the girl gradually starts liking the guy's company which she terms as *non-date* :p The series breaks a lot of stereotypes starting from a girl being so enthusiastic about developing an app like a geek to another girl delivering food to a girl whose romantic inclination is towards females to a divorced woman cherishing her dreams and finding romance at 41. It also brings into light how we try to hide behind our flaws in the fear of getting judged by others. At the same time, there are some safe corners where we become completely vulnerable without any filters. Yet, the trust often breaks due to communication barriers and the relationship goes on for a toss. The 6 episodes will leave you hanging for another Season. At least, they left me in a space of curiosity as to what will happen next!"

Black Spot,"Solid Show, but with some really poorly trained Detectives.","I'm not sure they understand how to protect anyone, especially themselves. However, they are great at following the clues, most of the time. It does have a great supernatural back drop that succeeds in not swallowing up the actual crimes and character development. But again, wow, do they make some dumb fn decisions. lol "" Hey lets go over into this massive creepy fn forest, where people are dropping like flies and poke around with no back up....Should I bring my gun, I don't know...maybe, maybe not."" -not actual quote."
Black Spot,"Think crime drama with more than a little Blair Witch, Pan's Labyrinth and Twin Peaks thrown in.","Villefranche is a small town without phone reception on the edge of a mysterious forest. The number of inhabitants is dwindling but there's a sharp rise in crime. Police inspector Laurène, once the victim of a crime herself, keeps on discovering fresh corpses.

Think crime drama with more than a little Blair Witch, Pan's Labyrinth and Twin Peaks thrown in.

This series came as a nice surprise. It has that catchy mix of dark, mystery ,fantasy, horror and drama set in a back woods French town. The old lore that keeps you tangled in Villefranche's stories. One not to be missed by fans of the genre!"
Black Spot,Good Dark Thriller,"Quite enjoying this. Good acting and holds your attention.

To the person complaining about the title translation, ""white zone"" refers to an area with no mobile reception. In English, this area is called a ""black spot"". Titles aren't always literal translations."
Black Spot,"Intriguing, exciting, dark","Danish television compiled this into 4 episodes. 4 long, but somehow just not long enough when yearning for more after each episode. Intriguing, dark, mysterious, obvious - yet not at all - leaving you with more questions than answers after each episode. I certainly recommend binging the series. Adding to all this, its filmed in a clever and mind blowing way, with gorgeous scenery. This is some of the best I've watched in a really long time. Mostly watching American or British in general (content, somewhat), this was a mind blowing- and extremely positive - surprise. It's weird, but certainly in a good way. This is actually my first review in here, created the profile as I simply had to tell everyone about how good I thought this actually is."
Black Spot,Black Spot,"This French series is set in Villefranche, a remote village where the crime rate in noticeably higher than the national average. As the story begins prosecutor Franck Siriani arrives in town to investigate what is going on; he finds himself working with Major Laurène Weiss of the local Gendarmerie and her small team. They are very different characters; Siriani is allergic to just about everything and Weiss is a tough woman who, when eighteen, cut off two fingers to escape after being chained up, in the vast forest that surrounds the town, by an unknown kidnapper. Each episode tends to include a 'case of the week' as well as ongoing investigations into the disappearance of the mayor's daughter, who went missing six months before the series started, and Weiss's attempts to discover what really happened to her in the forest all those years ago.

I really enjoyed this series; early on I got a real 'Twin Peaks' vibe but thankfully this didn't turn out to be a Gallic rip-off of that great show. Yes we have a town in a heavily forested part of the country where weird, possibly supernatural, things are happening but they are dealt with in a very different way. There is a great sense of mystery in the longer term story lines as well as the episodic stories. The location provides a great atmosphere; especially the forest scenes. The characters are interesting and nicely varied and the cast does a fine job bringing these characters to life. Season two closes with questions unanswered so hopefully we will get a third season some time. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of intriguing and slightly strange mysteries.

These comments are based on watching the series in French with English subtitles."
Black Spot,Pretty good except for one thing,"I just started up episode four. So far, I am enjoying it. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. The one thing that bugs me though is in the first episode they mention that the town they are in doesn't get phone reception yet the police chief is constantly on her cell phone. Weird."
Black Spot,Beautiful dark locations and mind-blowing plot. Great cliffhanger. Can't wait for next season! :-D,"This imaginative TV series proves that France could be the new Eurowood (not only because of the main ""character"": the forest)! ;-)

Maybe this vote should have been 10 instead of 9? It's hard to imagine, that the next season could be even better than this. But anyway: This is a great ""appetizer""! Great actors, great accelerating plot, great location, superb photography! ""Expect the unexpected!"" Vive La France!!!

Could be some kind of French ""Twin Peaks"" - on speed! ;-)"
Black Spot,Promising Start Devolves into Incoherence,"The first 3-4 episodes of this show are good, but before we get halfway into the season the plot gets bogged down in needless complexity. Storylines that seemed important now dwindle into nothing, to be replaced by new storylines that don't seem to be going anywhere. Characters suddenly appear for no reason at all. And the biggest weakness is the sheer implausibility of the situations and character motivations. The result is a hot mess, a series that can't seem to figure out what it wants to be - a dark crime drama? A horror/monster series? It's hard to tell. Kudos for the high production values and creepy atmosphere, but spooky synth music and chittering monster noises can't make up for the absence of a coherent and logical storyline."

Black Spot,Good show but some serious questions; I miss the IMDB chat board,Comentario no disponible
Black Spot,Great show!,This is a great show. has the same vibe as DARK. The dubbing is fantastic and the acting is really good.
Black Spot,"Beautiful Scenery, Dumb as Rocks Detectives","To me, this could have been so much better if the detectives had acted like they had any training whatsoever. The scenery is beautiful and the mood is creepy. It's an interesting show but the detectives are soooo very stupid it breaks immersion."
Black Spot,Meh...,"If anyone wants to see how detectives, police officers, criminals, prosecutors, waiters and random civilians would NEVER EVER act in real life then that is the show for you. Conversations are too staged, actors would be ok(ish) if the storybook would be a little bit better at least. Stopped watching after a few episodes..."
Black Spot,"French crime shows are great and this, one of the best","Firstly, how they translated ""Black Spot"" from ""White Zone"" in French is beyond me.

It's a crime show like none other you have seen. A police station in a remote French town in a dense forrest in the middle of nowhere France. Apparently, lots of crime there due to the remoteness, so they say in the show.

French film noire. Scenary is gorgeous, unspoiled etc., and, magical. Each show is completely different other than a murder (of the Mayors daughter) that is trying to be solved throughout the episodes.

No point in trying to describe this show other than it is weird but in a great way. The cast is just lovely in this, they really match well with the location. You best just watch it and after an episode or two, you will be completely hooked as I was.

Some of the other reviews do a decent job trying to explain this show but fall short, as this review does. JUST WATCH IT and you will thank me."
Black Spot,Out-Lynched Lynch + S2 EDIT,"While I'm new to French crime tv, I'm quickly becoming schooled. I'm just afraid that if this is standard stuff, I can't imagine much else being this good, let alone better. Nevertheless, I'm afraid that the inexplicable translation from Zone Blanche to ""Black Spot"" (in the US) could result in missed viewers who came up with wrong programs in their searches. This was my favorite discovery of 2017.

The assortment of characters are blended into a very believable ensemble as not one single one of them plays a disposable role. Some, who seem passive throughout, turn out to be critical antagonists eventually--it's a neat trick. The combination of the fantastic fog and woods environment coupled with an overt, but not overplayed, paranormal presence gives the viewer no shortage of suspense and chills. Watch it in a dark room without distractions.

This is what early Twin Peaks was. Undoubtedly, Lynch takes no credit as inspiration for and presumably has no connection with this production but, being a number one Lynch fan for 35 years now, I think this show's creators have outdone themselves and out-Lynched David, himself. This time. 9 stars.

EDIT: Having added S2 I note the following changes. Interpersonal relationships between main characters intensify playing out mostly good. The oddball Siriani tends to gradually grow into his inevitable acceptance of life in Villefranche while Sheriff Weiss and Nonours experience turmoil and threats to their curious buddy-cop relationship. More notable is the much heavier handed treatment of the supernatural component in this season compared to S1. In S1 the ghosts were delicately treated here and there in the landscape, never overdone, but, in S2, producers have ramped the monster arc and Weiss' accompanying obsession onto center stage, which has taken time away from the single episode plots involving the very strange and entertaining curious Villefranche local folk. There is also a short mythical historic arc about first century Roman occupation of the locale intended to tie the paranormal business into current day Villefranche. This doesn't provide much. In all, I feel producers aimed to compose all the various threads to support the main arc of Weiss chasing her monster. This changed the show from an anthology with underlying connecting threads to a single long movie split into episodes. I liked season 1 better. Still, I love the characters, and hope for more from these writers."
Black Spot,Good dark series with potential!,"Another of the French series in the mould of Revenant,Midnight sun,etc but possibly darker. Although the darker concept does not feel as natural as a nordic noir. Something feels made -up about it but it's still a pretty decent series. It is episodic with a longer story running in the background which might suit some viewers. The set up is strangely similar to Wayward Pines but it's far superior and believable than that. An attempt is made to explain most strange things which is always welcomed unlike some where they are weird for weird's sake!! Keep up the good work!"
Black Spot,Breathtaking,"A powerhouse cast, subtle and intricate writing, and some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in anything. This show it tense and beautiful and perfect."
Black Spot,It's more or less a parody,"Basically it makes fun of the American dark crime genre. Soundtrack, atmosphere, style, even clothing and cars. Other than the Cernunnos story, everything is almost a dark Tween Peaks + True Detective parody, with some bonhomme French humor. I enjoyed it."
Black Spot,Great show,Another great show out of france.. great story greats actors and actresses. suspense. Beautiful scenery..if Netflix looks at these ratings they should pay attention this is what separates them from the rest and Is the only reason why I pay for Netflix is for the international shows.
Black Spot,Liked it,Moody and a bit dark with just a touch of supernatural story. I do like European shows and enjoyed this one.
Black Spot,"Great thriller, drama with several unexpected twists.","I thought this started off a bit slow and wasn't sure about acting, but the 2nd episode was better than first and by 3rd totally hooked. Great storyline. love the forest...."
Black Spot,"Great atmosphere, incoherent plot(s).","It is easy on the eyes and displays great production value (ambiance, set designs, camera work, gorgeous images), but as endearing as the main characters are, they all act too dumb for the viewer to get involved into this shaggy tale. This is the classic bad writing issue of shows that grip you at first but peters out fast: no coherence in behavior or storyline. I am watching the series in French with english subtitles (yes, I can read and and hear at the same time) so I know this is not a translation issue. It is just bad story writing. I saw the 2 existing seasons, and I doubt a 3rd season can bring that mess to a reasonable conclusion. Oh, and I downgrade the show by 1 star for this: the guinea pig in the story is mistreated. No one should grab a guinea pig the way Nounours does (by its dorsal hair?! Are you insane or just too dumb, man???). And no guinea pig should be left in a tiny cage without a guinea pig mate to commiserate with."
Black Spot,"Sloppy script, dull, slow","Rural town crime blended with a surreal story Although I made the effort to watch the two seasons, I could not find any entertainment here, the script has many separated lines of continuity that makes it difficult for the viewer to connect, the pace is slow and dull. At the end of the first season, there is a shocking twist (wow,.. I have not expect that..) , but, again they lose the opportunity and plunge into the second season following the same lame boring format. Looks like there was some Stephen King books portrayal influence when they created some characters. Nice landscape imagery steals the show."
Black Spot,"Tense, binge-worthy crime/drama, with supernatural elements","I have never reviewed anything before, but had to talk about this fantastic French series, available on Netflix. No fancy jargon here, just my 2 cents as a lover of good series. This show is hard to properly describe, but I'll try...and being American, I watched the French-language version, relying on subtitles. A Major in the Gendarmerie, Laurene, lives in a small village/town called Villefranche. We see that 20 years ago, she was kidnapped and chained in a place in the forest (which in itself could be a character its own). Her memories aren't quite clear, and this is the major plot of the story. I really don't want to say much more. Each case leads her closer to the truth. This series is clever, beautifully filmed, and keeps you wanting more."

A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Only a true immigrant from Taiwan can share the deep meaning by the story,"Just finished watching it on Netflix last weekend. Most immigrants from Taiwan to the United States should be able to understand the meaning of loss by immigration and share the feeling of the cultural revival. Because of the backgrounds are set in Taipei and San Francisco, I am completely attracted to the content. Unlike other idol dramas or the *tow* dramas, the director is very careful to use the different time and space in the two cities. The interactions stirs up the long-lost memories in my heart."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Awesome show of two cultures,"This show was very good, westerners may need a bit of an open mind to watch a series full of subs but it is well worth it and not all has subs.

I am English my partner Malaysian Chinese and this was a very good show we could easily relate too.

Hoping for a season 2"
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Drive me crazy when seeing that Nian-nian,"Story itself is okay but the Taiwan actress Nian-Nian really give false impression for those not know real Taiwanese. Taiwanese women weren't like that at all. She is stupid, don't know what's her life is pursuing, day dreaming and spoiled. Not referring to the character she acted, the acting by the actress make her look like a moron. During the whole show, I can't count how many times I would like to hit someone when see that Nian-Nian. That's the main reason I rated for 3. The drama is advertising Taiwan totally fine by me, indeed it score 3 cuz of the nice scene took. But just don't distort the imagine of Taiwanese women please."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,A show with deep historical and cultural manifestation.,"If you don't understand Taiwanese American culture, you would have a difficult time understanding the nuances in their acting and different plots. I agree that the acting is a bit unnatural, but the screenplay is really well written. The scenes, the dialogues, and the contextual setting truly reflect the sophistication among educated Taiwanese, who usually migrate to the US. This show really resonates with the Taiwanese American community and it's good for any audience who are interested in Taiwanese/Taiwanese American culture."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Low budget production and bad acting,"This show is horribly directed and produced, and the acting is so awkward and fake."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,An emotional roller coaster,"Ignore all the negative reviews this was a delightful drama, which showed us life in two completely different cities. Be warned there are some real tearjerker scenes, so keep the tissues handy. The cast are great, especial the actor who played one of the two female leads father. The two leading ladies are a delight to watch and the way they portray a more traditional Taiwanese woman and a Taiwanese American is excellent All in all worth worth a watch."
A Taiwanese Tale of Two Cities,Too much overacting in sad scenes (which there are a lot),"This show has its moments and starts off strong, but the amount of times you have to put with a character overacting and crying constantly just put me off the show."

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"caricatured, yet surprisingly honest.","Kimmy is cute, strong, and compassionate, a great blend. She is gullible, but she is also wise and vigilant. Tina Fey's touch of intelligent and strikingly blunt comedy shines through."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,A Brief Review: Don't judge the show based on the first episode... Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt gets better... a lot better.,"While not as funny, binge worthy, or all together accessible as her first sitcom, 30 Rock, Tina Fey's second outing as head writer proves to have its own charms. The series may be slow at first, but give it three to four episodes and you'll be hooked. With a cast that gets better with age, writing that goes from zany and out of this world to surprisingly profound and sweet, and a stellar sense of humor, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is the kind of series that improves over time, much like Ms. Fey's first sitcom. The cast includes a zesty Carol Kane, the funny as always Jane Krakowski, 30 Rock Guest alum Tituss Burgess, and our lead Ellie Kemper; these four hilariously colorful players take the normal NBC formula for comedy and make it into something far smarter and much sharper. The writing also manages to succeed beyond my expectations. As a HUGE fan of 30 Rock, I know Ms. Fey can write up a storm. However, I thought it was the comedian perception of Television that made it so fresh. No it's her perception of diversity and identity and all their wonderfulness that makes this show work so well. As I mentioned earlier, the show is funny yes, but also much deeper than the common person will perceive. I'm glad to know that Netflix went for the full two seasons, for this show demands at least that many to get into its full rhythm. Remember, 30 Rock wasn't a masterpiece till season 3 I can't wait to see where the shows is when it hits its third season and trust me there will be a 3rd season."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"A lighthearted and funny show, but season 3 disappoints","I'm a little late to the party as I've only watched Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt this year, but I figured it was time to watch it since I'm a fan of Tina Fey and 30 Rock. I like all of the characters, with my favorite being Titus since he has some of the most memorable and hilarious lines of the show. I quickly binge watched seasons 1 and 2 in the matter of days, but it took me a few weeks to get through season 3. I wanted to like it and I was very excited to watch it, but it was honestly a big let down compared to the previous two seasons. The jokes felt forced and I was very unhappy with some of the plot decisions. It felt like major story lines were built up only to be torn apart and it was disappointing to see that happen after spending so much time invested in them. The season 3 finale was a little better and I was relatively happy with how they set up the plot for season 4, but I'm worried they'll just repeat the same mistakes as this time around. Overall, this show is an amusing, feel good comedy and it does bring a smile to my face, I just hope that the writers will have some more focus and direction in the coming seasons."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Wow.,"What a brilliant, brilliant show. I'm surprised that I'm the first reviewer on here! Seriously though, I began streaming this show just about an hour ago, with netflix's system of 'single-day-season-releases' I've just kept streaming. I'm now up to the third episode and I'm blown away with how funny this show is. Tina fey has always been hilarious to me, and same with Ellie Kemper, so i've been intrigued by this show since it's announcement. This show is, at it's roots, a very funny show, chances are you will laugh a lot during this show. But it's not all about that, this show has several layers, it's got lots of heart and fantastic characters. As I mentioned before, I'm only up to the 3rd episode but this show is showing fantastic promise, I haven't been this invested in a show's pilot in a while. Hilarious story, fantastic acting, great writing, great direction. This looks like a good one, stream it when you get the chance! 9/10 (so far)"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Delightfully weird and consistently hilarious,"I've never been a big binge watcher, but I was so grabbed by this show right from the first episode that I just couldn't stop.

This show is full of beautifully gleeful charm, with a central character who can't stop smiling and no mean-spirited jokes anywhere in sight. The whole thing is just consistently happy and can really cheer you up within seconds.

I admit that the story does get a little tiresome at some points, where there isn't as much joking, but the series manages to keep reinventing itself in new and fun ways that brings back your interest immediately.

It's also a very subtly clever satire. Whilst the majority of it may seem like silly fun, the back story of the doomsday cult, the theme song and a whole host of other stuff is actually very intelligent, and of course, a lot of fun too.

You've got to watch this series, whether you want to binge it or not, because it's such a refreshingly happy show that stands out amongst the crowd of idiotic sitcoms and burning dramas.

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,A Must-See for Anyone with a Quirky Sense of Humor,"It started slow. I honestly only watched it because it was advertised on Netflix and I thought it was an interesting plot. The pilot had me cracking a smile but it wasn't great. But because I was lazy, I let the next episodes play. I have to say I was glad that I did!

I laughed out loud on multiple occasions. Though the characters were hard to relate to at first, by the third episode I was laughing like crazy! This show is full of one-liners that will be both hilarious and catchy. And the minute you think something is too serious, something unexpected makes you crack a smile.In short, it's silly and sweet and has just the right amount of drama.

Give this show a chance. As I always say: Never trust a pilot episode."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Slow start, but gets a lot better","After watching the first episode, I was disappointed but wanted to give it a couple more episodes. The show felt empty and oh so clichéd. If you watched the first episode and didn't laugh a single time, don't give up. After the very mediocre first episode, the quality increased exponentially throughout the season. The second through forth episodes are decent, but everything after #4 is pure gold. If I was rating solely based on the first episode, I would give this show a 5/10. If I was rating solely based on the first four episodes, I would give this show a 7/10, but the rest of the season is strong enough to give it an 8. The show is approachable enough for basically anyone, but quirky enough to keep you interested. This is a good example of how to make a family-friendly comedy show with some bite, it would be a perfect PG-13 if it was a movie."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Delightful and heartwarming light dramedy,"Newest show from Netflix is a hit. A very enjoyable light series that keeps the comedy rolling while exploring a much deeper drama. This is your new ""go to"" show when you just need a reason to smile. As for smiles, Ellie Kemper's is as genuine and heartwarming as they come.

One should not expect to either be rolling on the ground or crying in their pillow while watching. There are some side-splitting lines though, and there are some dramatic portions that will allow you to connect with the characters on a deeper level. This is a light comedy / drama and makes for excellent light TV watching.

This show fills a void that has been much missed from recent TV. Today's comedies are often slapstick with canned laugh tracks, or deep drama that evoke hardly a giggle throughout. This show marries the best of both world together and provides a genuinely enjoyable experience. This show will not change the world, feed the hungry, or raise social awareness about anything except the plight of ""Mole Women"" everywhere. It will leave you smiling, and in today's times, that is enough for me."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Unsustainable Kimmy Schmidt,"2019 sees the end of the Netflix series that began with such fanfare and acclaim but ends with a whimper rather than a bang.

Ellie Kemper plays Kimmy Schmidt, held hostage in an underground bunker for much of her twenties, by a doomsday cult. She's given a new lease of life following her rescue, so moves to New York. She moves in with Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess) a struggling actor who dreams of Broadway and gets a job as a nanny for Jaqueline White (Jane Krakowski) an uptown divorcee whose husband has left her with a young son and teenage daughter to look after.

For the first couple of seasons, I felt like ""Kimmy Schmidt"" was essential viewing. Shorn of the restrictions of Network TV, Tina Fey created a warm but hilarious series with characters specifically written for most of the lead actors but also able to use her star power to pull in some dynamite guest stars. It's a touch sad then that I feel the show has dropped off a bit with each of his subsequent seasons. I'm not sure, because although her specific writing credits remain a couple per season, whether Fey's general involvement has waned as the show has run on, or if some other creative force moved on but although the style of humour stayed the same, it just didn't seem to land as well.

I think, on the whole, if asked whether or not to recommend the show to someone, I'd still say that I would. There are only 51 episodes and of those the vast majority are very good - it's just a little unfortunate that it couldn't maintain the high standards that the early seasons set."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,A show that is worth the watch,"Firstly a heads up: I like Tina Fey. I like her way of seeing the world and her ability to make fun of very subtle things in a very blunt way. And I love 30 Rock. If you do too you'll appreciate Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. If you don't you'll fall in love with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and watch all 7 seasons of 30 Rock in one sitting.

You'll know the story of Kimmy Schmidt by now, so I'll not get into that. What I'll rather talk about is the magnificent performance of Ellie Kemper as Kimmy. I've first seen and enjoyed her in The Office but that's the first time I've seen her as a lead actress. And I must say, she does a really good job as the girl who shields the cruelty of life with a big smile and an almost childish appreciation of the world.

As in 30 Rock there is no room for subtlety in the way the characters are portrayed. Apart form Kimmy, Jane Krakowski as Jacqueline plays the rich, pretentious snob (very similar to her role as Jenna Maroney in 30 Rock), Kimmy's room mate Titus is a giant singing gay man with an unfulfilled dream. It's not that the characters don't have depth, they do, but it's the almost comical exaggeration of character traits I've enjoyed so much in 30 Rock that carries this show as well.

But again, even if you weren't a great fan of 30 Rock, give this show a try. It's full of wit with a lot of social criticism between the lines. But what makes this show really fun is Kimmy's 90s humor and her naivety with which she approaches the world.

I've never felt so optimistic about a new sitcom since New Girl and it sure is one of the best new comedy shows in both 2014 and 2015 and after a whole lot of amazing drama series the first netflix comedy that is worth the watch."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Funny but also unique,"If you like a 30 Rock style of humor, you'll enjoy this show. There's a lot of fourth wall breaking and just bizarre humor involved. If that's not your style, then obviously don't watch. But if it is, or if you're just looking for a comedy that's different from things you've seen before, then you'll enjoy this one."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Best Netflix comedy yet,"This show is so fun! You can tell it's written by Tina Fey because it's got a (perkier) 30 Rock vibe. UKS utilizes many aspects of New York (Today show, times square, pick pockets).

I think it's funny when Kimmy's lack of education comes into play (e.g. proclaiming ""Urethra!"" instead of ""Eureka!"") She also uses lingo from the 90s/00s that really clash with modern day.

I know many people are comparing UKS to other shows (that I have not seen). However, it seems original to me. I mean, doomsday cult member trying to make it in the big apple?

It's worth a watch!"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"eh, got over it quick","My wife and I were into the first season. It was funny and the characters weren't bad. Plus it's a great idea for a plot! We only made it a few episodes into the second season. It wasn't because it wasn't good, or it had changed; it was just the same people becoming more annoying. Titus being 100% over the top in 100% of his scenes was too much to stand. Jane Krakowski's character ended up being annoying, the land lady got to be annoying. It's NOT a bad show, but it wore off quickly. Love Ellie Kemper though!"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Dreadful,Just awful. Trying too hard to be funny and it's just dreadful
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Such an unlikely combination yields a brilliant result,"Honestly, the two reviews that have been written so far are unreasonable. Unbreakable Kimmy Schimdt is by no means average, poor or unfunny. It shines through in it's originality, tactful balancing of humour and satire and it's absolutely endearing. The premise is strange and does not suggest it's a comedy even for a black comedy it seems like a stretch. A woman escapes a cult after being imprisoned for 15 years and starts a new life in New York City. The pilot begins as the women are being rescued and brought back out to the world after 15 years of imprisonment. It's a very unconventional idea for a comedy yet it exceeds expectations. Ellie Kemper, the subject of this show, is wonderfully quirky, sweet and her performance is enjoyable to watch.

Tina Fey's writing is clearly asserted as the main character, Kimmmy, is a strong, powerful, determined and unbreakable. Co-writer and producer, Robert Carlock, also deserves some credit in this. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is not hidden in 30 Rock's shadow and does not attempt to duplicate results. It works in it's own right and is brilliantly executed. It's tone is gleefully upbeat and light-hearted yet it hints at darker themes and it's implementation of dark comedy is succinct and rewarding. So please don't be so quick to judge. Definitely give it a watch it's worthwhile."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Titus Steals the Show,"I gave this show a 10 because I looove Titus. I mean how can you not? The main character, Kimmy is kinda forgettable but she's not as bad. I love Lillian and Jacqueline too they're so awesome. But Titus IS THE SHOW."
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,"Tina Fey's comedic brilliance does not disappoint. Lovable quirky characters, surprisingly honest and extraordinary writing make 'Kimmy Schmidt' a must-see comedy","There's a lot to what seems to be a simple story of an Indiana Mole Woman moving to New York to finally experience life how she wants it. Tina Fey and her writing team already proved themselves with 30 Rock which had some of the best written comedy of all time with what is in my opinion one of the best television characters of all time, Jack Donaghy, and while Kimmy Schmidt is a different approach to her formula it still very much feels like something from the minds of the creators of 30 Rock. The Jokes are still fantastic and smart, with Pop Culture references to an extreme and quirky humor that goes along very well to the silly tone of the show itself.

The Performances here are all top notch. Ellie Kemper sticks out the most, she has her award win down right here, with a lovable sweet and honest performance as an ever grinning oblivious girl with a big heart. But even the supporting cast is perfect. Titus Burgess nails it at what is basically his character from 30 Rock just without the success. While he starts off as annoying he gets to be one of the most hilarious parts of the show as a desperately trying actor. Jane Krakowski is basically Jenna from 30 Rock, still as perfect as an actress can get for a role like that. Carol Kane as the freaky weird landlord of Kimmy's and Titus' delivers just as much and is just as lovable as about every aspect of the show.

But the smaller things stick out just as much, the costume design is fantastic with the glowing colorful wardrobe of Kimmy's or Titus' long 70's like shirts. The sets stick out as well, Kimmy's appartement always seems to look different and kind of progresses since she moved in there with Titus', the apartement becomes a part of Kimmy herself in a way. Jacqueline Vorhees' house just as much encompasses exactly for what she stands with something like a huge fridge just for diet water.

All in all, can not praise this show enough. It's lighthearted silly and at the same time smart and sometimes sophisticated fun with extraordinary writing, characters you WILL fall in love with, dedication from the whole crew in terms of lighting, set and costume design, cinematography, original score. It makes for what is one of Netflix' best orginials now and seeing that the first season was made for NBC we can only suspect that the show will get even better now that they can work under the free creative environment Netflix offers them. I absolutely cried from laughing here and at the next time I admired the creativity Tina Fey once again brings out here.

10/10"
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,Was really funny until,I actually liked the first 2 seasons. The 3rd season was ok and the last season is just horrible.
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,season 4 ruins it all,I loved this because i could laugh and forget about contemporary politics but season 4 seems to try to make up for all the other seasons not saying anything which makes it super annoying. Whether you agree or not isnt the issue i just dont watch comedy to be reminded of annoying ass reality so thanks for ruining one of my old fav shows you dumbasses

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,the adorrible kimmy schmidt,I know this show is getting a lot of crap but I adore kimmy shes sweet and too cute for words I like the humor the story is great too its a fantastic show and its really too good too miss you cant resist kimmy or titious they both work perfectly together and are hilarious you really need to watch this one
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,so random so wacky so funny,"Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) was in the 8th grade when she was kidnapped by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm). She spends the next 15 years in an underground bunker in Indiana with the Reverend and his other captive wives. They are rescued by the police and become media sensations known collectively as the Indiana Mole Women. While doing media in New York, Kimmy leaves the group to strike out on her own. Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane) rents her a basement apartment which she shares with Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess). She starts working for rich Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski) to care for her stepkids.

It's a funny ridiculous surreal Netflix sitcom. I like Ellie Kemper's unhinged comedy. Titus is the breakout character although he's a bit annoying to me. He's actually mean to Kimmy at first. I'm not in love with the introduction of Jacqueline White although I really like Kimmy's chemistry with the spoiled stepdaughter Xan. It's too bad that Dylan Gelula didn't become a main cast member. The serial aspect gets rambling. There are some really funny stories. There is something to be said about the catchy opening theme which always sets a good mood. It would be nice to settle upon a more set situation in the comedy. So much of this is random. The randomness can be funny but it's also random."

Black Money Love,"One of the best,but has some minor flaws","Kara Para Ask(roughly translated to English as Black Money Love) is easily one of the best Turkish TV series out there. I usually hate Turkish series(I only watched Ezel before this) because they are all the same,based on the same story but just with different characters/locations. Fortunately,I was actually forced to watch this because I was in a hospital and my TV remote didn't work,so i was stuck on just one channel for 8 days. At first I was very suspicious because I had some stereotypes about Turkish TV series,but on the third day I was actually enjoying watching it. So what makes Kara Para Ask stand out in infinite bland of weeping women,endless tea drinking(they even rival the British people :D),and more weeping?

THE GOOD: -Outstanding acting,especially for one Turkish series

Explanation:The two main actors,Omer and Elif,are excellent and believable characters,their role really suits their appearance/style. Even antagonists(Tajar,Metin,miss Nedret)are really good and you actually start to hate them,which is always a sign that they nailed their acting. The only mediocre actress was definitely Nilufer(she is truly annoying as somebody already wrote).

-Gorgeous locations

Explanation:Turkey is really a beautiful country,and this series really make the best of it stand out,with its top-notch camera work.The best thing is that there are actually quite a few locations in the series,as opposed to your usual Turkish series where there is like 3 houses in the whole series :D

-Beautiful soundtrack

Explanation:I fell in love with the sounds and songs of this series.I actually went so far that I downloaded 2 songs from it because they were perfect to play while having,um,some fun with my girlfriend.They really make everything much more compelling and believable.

And I left the best for the end: -Amazing story

Explanation:The story is just a whole new level for the Turkish series.However they didn't even went far from your usual ""love wins all"" story,they just upgraded it.Instead of some usual characters you really have unique ones,everyone has its own strengths and weaknesses,and when Omer and Elif try to break through some tough times you are really sympathizing with them.The story is not just centered on the love of the two protagonists,its also centered on their families,and even love stories of some minor characters(Metin- Nilufer). All this really makes it stand out.The best thing:they minimized weeping,although some characters just can't do without it(Yes I'm looking at you Nilufer,if your tea isn't sweet enough that's not a reason to cry :D).Without all the tears the series actually just gained on emotional side.

THE BAD:

-Unrealistic violence

Explanation:Although Turkish censorship is pretty strict(no sex scenes,violence,even swearing),they could at least make it more believable by putting more realistic muzzle flashes/gun smoke because its pretty visible that it's fake.Another drawback is that every character holds the gun somehow awkward,even those who should know how to hold it(Omer/Husejin/other police officers). Yet another drawback is totally unrealistic wounds,I mean when you get shot to the head there is really a lot of blood,not just small red blurred dot.I know this ain't Saw or something but that could definitely be better.

-Some kiss scenes were awkward AF

Explanation:Although I know not anybody can make out like me :D a.k.a Casanova style,it's still somewhat expected when 2 people are married that they French kiss instead of your 10 year old kisses.The funniest thing is when Metin and Nilufer are making out because you can clearly see that there is no passion involved and Nilufer acts like she is kissing a Chernobyl boar,and not a human being(I can actually understand that,'cause Metin/Faith is ugly AF :D) But still,could be way better.

-A bit repetitive plot

Explanation:I already told that the story was cool,but after watching it for a while you really get used to all the plot twists and you can easily predict what will happen next.I don't know,maybe it's just me but after episode 40 i almost knew everything in advance.Sometimes you should just make thing go as planned,without any problems.

That's it,thanks for reading! :)"
Black Money Love,Enjoyed it,"Saw this on Netflix in UK and as subtitles don't bother me I thought I'd give it a try. I was hooked from the first episode and as I'm off work sick, I've watched all 54 epsiodes in a week ! Plot is good (sometime a bit longwinded to be fair) and acting is ok, especially when when compared to some of the drivel on UK tv. I think I will look up other Turkish thing to watch now."
Black Money Love,"Awesome TV series, great romance","After watching all 164 episodes, the way Netflix divided them up, I read a bunch of reviews here. I would agree that if you are looking for something to criticize, yes there are legitimate things you can find. Implausible events, endless crying, tea drinking, same plot lines repeated over and over, scenes to drag it out further than necessary, things like that. But in what could be considered a very long movie, as in somewhere between 110 and 150 hours, some of those things will happen.

But here is the thing. Tuba B. She is simply phenomenal in this TV series. And so is her love interest Engin. They make the most handsome and beautiful on-screen couple ever! I loved it when they looked into each others' eyes. It didn't matter to me how long or often they did that. It never got old. The way they connected was so seemingly real, that apparently there are lots of people around the world who believe they are together in real life, not just on the set of this series. I can see how they could think that. And if it did happen I and probably millions of other fans would be thrilled.

This is a crime drama with a lot of soap opera and intrigue in it. But I never got bored. I have to say that I became more obsessed about watching this than anything I have ever watched, whether a movie or TV series. I thought all the actors were great. I could relate to most of their characters. But not as much as I could relate to what Elif as played by Tuba B. Was feeling at any given moment. I can't think of another acting job that continuously had me feeling everything that she was feeling. Her romance with Omer, played by Engin, is the stuff that dreams are made of. Every moment they are together is magical, even though they suffer through so many tragedies and betrayals of close friends, coworkers, and family, as well as their personal struggles with each other. It could be said that the most important aspect of this story is the concept of Love Conquers All.

I wasn't all that happy with the last few episodes, but they had to come up with some way to tie together so many separate plot lines, so I could understand that the writers had to find a way to end it. Although I would have kept watching no matter how many episodes they made. And I will no doubt go back and watch the whole series over and over.

Now that I am back looking for other movies and TV series to watch on streaming channels, I just cannot seem to find anything that holds my attention as much as this TV series did.

I have been falling in love with the lead actresses of countless movies and TV shows over the decades. But this actress Tuba B. In this TV series is in a league of her own. Of course she is beautiful in every way, but there is something about her hazel eyes that is mesmerizing. As well as her great voice, stylish clothes, long dark hair, and everything about her facial expressions and even body language."
Black Money Love,Wonderful Series!,Outstanding Acting! Love Engin and Tuba... they have the most amazing chemistry you could ever watch. Brilliant series overall.. excellent crime drama. Metin is one of the most fascinating characters you could ever watch!
Black Money Love,Metin is the Key,"I have seen a lot of Turkish drama but Kara Para Ask is always my favorite.The story, the cast the shooting, directing were the best. It tells the story of lost diamonds and unknown killer along with beautiful but somehow(childish) love story of Elif and Omer & Metin and Nilufer. THE other reviews have mentioned enough about everything except for the one thing I believe was the real key to this huge success:Tayyar and Metin(Faith) Dundar. The character of Tayyar is new to the drama he represent pure evil a wolf disguised as lamb and his worst deeds was his son Metin. The first is a successful businessman who has charitable initiatives and has wife and son and everyone loves him, but he hides a criminal aspect of organic trading and money laundering. He has a secret son who he adopted as his nephew and made him a criminal and his right hand his nick name is Metin. Metin is young man who was born of a crime (Tayyar raped his mother and then cut her tongue off)and grew up in the dark to become a psycho planning to avenge Tayyar in closest chances. But something happens to change his life forever when he falls in love with his prisoner, which teaches him love and represents for him everything that was missing compassion and innocence. Tayyar relationships and implementation makes his arrest impossible and develops events in the series of trying to solve the mystery of the death of Elife's father and Omar fiancée to reveal the threads about the involvement of Tayyar and Metin and develop at an accelerated pace holding breath until it ends before picking it up.They get to know the truth and discover lots of facts about life,family,friends and love.Although i didn't like the ending very well, i expected better but still was good (for Turkish they adore sad endings so i should be grateful hahaha). The writers innovated unique characters, especially strong mentally, and emotionally eg: Metin: even made him a victim sympathize with others despite his cruelty! we loved the bad boy here , they even called best TV bastard ever . As the director put best selection of scenes and the use of music of genius Toygar ışıklı and generosity in production , the wonderful cast , devoted crew...etc all these elements led to the success of the series and fame. And I disagree with those who say that the reason for success is Omar and Elif love story because the story between them is not new or attractive, same old boring story, and doesn't evolve or give much pleasure or romance. Tuba (Elif) didn't act very well to prove her love to the audience, especially in the second season. The rest of the actors were very good, especially Saygin Soysal, who dazzled people with his successful coup for a psychopathic in love and seeking revenge. Again work does not succeed in the names of heroes even if they are stars, but teamwork and innovation and output and production and writing distinctive are making any series successful or not."
Black Money Love,Touche to review of Awesome TVSeries great romance,"I was going to write a review after I had watched the whole series and this viewer said most of what I saw in the show the fantastic actors one and all. I even got to love Faith. I spent a month watching the series and now a let down to it is over. Liked the ending for Tuba and Engin . Not sure if now they are together so hard to find the answer . If they are I can see why per the looks they had for each other reminds me of when Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton did Cleopatra you knew there was something on fire there. If not they at least gave their all and I am looking for other series. Years ago I was a soap opera fan in my U. S. not been now for many years and this was done very well and kept my interest over any of ours today . Wish that we could see more of the Turkish shows with English over time . I almost felt like I was learning Turkish language. Thank you , all of the super actors and the writers and directors for an entertaining series?"
Black Money Love,Intriguing viewing,Watched this in Scotland. Really enjoyed it. Wee bit predictable at times but enjoyed acting by most of the cast. Getting to like Turkish TV series and movies. So many gorgeous male actors to enjoy and they have changed my opinion of Turkish men in general as not had good experience in the past. This one kept me interested and watching and might inspire me to visit again. Hope to see more starring the lead actor with the beautiful eyes to die for.
Black Money Love,I loved the show so much I'm watching it again and again,Amazing story line and characters. Mesmerizing music. Beautiful ending. A very good Turkish tv show. As good as Winter Sun (Kis Gunesi). I highly recommend this show.
Black Money Love,"Australian Viewer. Twists, Turns, Love, Intrigue, Great Acting.","The lead characters, Ömer and Elif have been well casted together. They have a real sense of attraction and love. Elifs' best friend, Bahar, has fantastic acting ability too. Some parts of episodes seem slow and frustrating but it is so well worth it to get past this and watch the whole series. As one of the commissioners quoted ""everyone's a suspect!"". I love Turkish genres as they have drama, romance, adventure and action. Most of all, they have a great storyline!!! Unlike many mainstream shows. This is definitely a must watch!

Don't watch any Turkish shows if you are on a diet!!! They know how to cook and what to show to the audience. Much too yummy!"
Black Money Love,20 Episodes too long,Comentario no disponible
Black Money Love,Amazing Tuba as Elif !,Tuba's actin - Elif is amazing ans so so beautyful ! One of the best Tv series ! I loved it.
Black Money Love,The script is maddening.,"I suspect that all of the positive reviews about this story come from Turks or other Middle Easterners that are accustom to this level of tumultuous and erratic in a script. The maniacal changes and circumstances would look like a EKG if plotted.

Everyone of the characters, with the exception of Omar's mother, lie to each other constantly! And this is definitely true about Omar, playing the upright and sincere police officer. And they keep OBVIOUS things from each other, even when they would alleviate the other's suffering, only then comes the long pause of worry, homelessness or dramatic self talk that all is lost! The thing in my mind, where I am in the series, is that ONCE AGAIN Elif is going through hell and Omar fails to mention that Fatih stole the gun and orchestrated the whole murder. Then again, they do NOTHING to look out for Elif in jail, no background checks, no suspicion, no concern for her but to bring some reading material. I've watched this far because the erratic moments of love and affection between Elif and Omar are stirring, but then I have to be ready for the inevitable disaster."
Black Money Love,"sexy, compelling story but oh my Gosh. STOP CRYING","Interesting plotting , lots of convoluted twists and turns set against a Beautiful backdrop filled with beautiful people. I was hooked and binge watched hundreds of episodes. The problem is the soap operaesque camera holds making scenes melodramatically go no for EVER while no one is saying anything and at least half of every episode is filled with hysterical women, crying, sobbing and screaming. YIKES STOP . STOP STOP. i had to fast forward through half of each episode to get back to plot"
Black Money Love,"Loved, loved, loved!!!","As an English speaking South African, I've recently become hooked on Turkish drama series! Para Kara Ask is the fourth one I've watched and definitely my favorite so far. I could not get enough of Ömer and Elif, their on screen chemistry was absolutely amazing, both so beautiful to watch and they both brought so much to the characters they played. Arda and Pelin with their constant banter were so funny and entertaining too! The evil Tayver was brilliant as the villain, actually all the actors were fantastic but I have to say that Nilufer became extremely irritating with her constant crying and pathetic expression throughout the show, I fast forwarded her scenes most of the time!

Overall it was a really good and very gripping series and I'm so sad that it ended and I had to say goodbye to them all."
Black Money Love,"150 hours of rollercoaster , A deadly combo of Action, Deception, life lessons and an unforgettable unconditional love.","The best and worst part of Kara Para Ask is it's length - it drains you out and at the same time, hooks you at the edge of the seat. The characters start to become your own family, their love, pain becomes yours. This one was my longest netflix drama. Amidst the COVID 19 lockdown situation, these 150 hours with Omar, Elif, Arda, Pelin, Asli, Nilu, Tayaar, Fatih, Hussein gave me that energy to stay at home for weeks and remain hooked to this memorable life journey of one the most beautiful on screen couple. After the end also, I am eager to have more of Engin and Tuba- Their love-hate relationship and their smile which makes every fan mad and fall in love again and again."
Black Money Love,Engin Akyürek,"Engin Akyurek is the best actor in Turkey and through him we got acquainted with the Turkish series and films, and he is the best person to play the character of the detective."
Black Money Love,Logic hast left the room,"The actors performed very good. But the writing sucks big time. Not one character is making logical decisions. The director needs to create problems, i can understand that. But the problems are created because of the most ridiculous decisions people make. It's so unrealistic, impossible to take it serious."
Black Money Love,Entertaining but horrible editing,"I find the series entertaining, except for one major aspect that can drive you nuts - the editing. As a prime example, in virtually every episode, there are one or more scenes that involve Elif and Omer staring at each other for 20 or 30 seconds, or longer, with no dialogue. The obvious question is why is this the case? The very poor editing greatly detracts from the quality of the show, which suffers from some of the worst editing I have ever seen."
Black Money Love,"Fantastic crew, good music choice, the dialects and phrases they used are beautiful you want to quote them next time.","One of the best series I have ever watched, as a matter of fact I am not so much into series, but this one got me hooked so easily. Kara Para Ask (black money Love) or Tikur Fikir in Amharic is a success, it has been watched all over the world,a actually as far as I know it's translated into 16 or more languages, very exciting, I want to congratulate the producer, the director, the cameraman, the crew, all the actors and support acts involved in it! We should always remember without the whole gang the movie wouldn't have accomplished it's achievement. Elif and Omer are of course the gems, the lead actors they have nailed it! What a significant match and romance. I do not want to pass without commenting on Fetih and Nulfeir's love affair, Nulfier looks so innocent and fragile....just only wished if she doesn't cry a lot. Fetih's character is awesome, from how he was raised and how Tayer has manipulated him, it really make you believe as if it is a true story. Fetih well done!, that goes to your half-brother Mert as well. Think of Hussein and his wife too! They remind you of those old traditional couple who live next door. A superb family, I love how talkative and naive Hussien wife is :-). Omer's mom is also a brilliant actress! And how about his mistress....the Russian woman....hmm good role! KPA has so much cries which makes it look unreal at times, but it is OK. And there comes Tayer! He is so good at his role you feel like you want to strangle him yourself! How about Asli and her craziness? and Bahar and Levent...and all the rest of the crew whom I haven't mentioned have done great job! Fantastic team, the crew casting should be praised. Excellent music choice, dialects and phrases they used are fascinating you'd want to quote them next time. All the characters will remain with you for a long time. I noticed few editing flaws, but comparing to the length of the series that should not really matter. Some of the accidents and their recovery seems so fictitious. Around the end I feel like they have tried to stretch it and it was going to start to bore me but then again they pulled it back on the track, instead the finishing could have been more extended. All in all a beautiful must watch series. Enjoy!"
Black Money Love,Quite entertaining series!,"Well, ""Kara Para Ask"" is my seventh series I have watched so far, and I must say I didn't quite enjoy this one as much as I enjoyed ""Brave and Beautiful"". I know this one was far earlier (and that's basically my mistake to watch ""Brave and Beautiful"" first). The story is promising and entertaining at the same time at first, but it gets boring and boring as it continues the over repetitive plot and situation with some characters in it. To me, personally, I like the characters of Omer and Elif, but frankly speaking, the scene stealer is definitely Fatih/Metin and Nilufer. They are very good, I almost thought they are as the leads.

Overall, it's good enough and I will try to repeat some of my favorite scenes in it."
Black Money Love,Director is an amateur,"I have never seen so many drawn out scenes that were totally unnecessary to make this production annoying in a lot of parts. To Many drawn out love talk scenes, to many drawn out mourning scenes, to many drawn out dramatic pauses, you know after about ten to twenty seconds the audience gets it. And you have Nilufer crying through the whole series ALL THE TIME, Do you know how annoying that is to watch her burst into tears over the slightest little thing!!!! One of the worst directed series I have ever watched, the only saving grace to this series was the story line if you gave it a chance to tell it properly without all that wasted cinematography. I am Sicilian and I thought Sicilians were emotional but you portrayed the Turks as The Kings of emotion!!!!"
Black Money Love,Amazing Tuba Buyukustun as Elif!,"Tuba Büyüküstün is the most talented actres , her actin in Kara Para Ask l is amazing. I love it. with Engin they give us a beautyful couple Elif -Omer. great story line ! Thak you."
Black Money Love,With a few tweaks it could be the best Turkish series out there.,Comentario no disponible
Black Money Love,Soap Opera,"Unlike most of the other reviewers, I'm not Turkish or anything like that (whatever that means) and have nothing for or against Turkish TV shows. I watched the first episode on a friend's recommendation. For me it was over-acting, slow-moving, a ton of crying and faces agape with one emotion or another. Yes, as several reviewers say, the actors (male and female) are beautiful. The mothers are crying anxiously, ever-worried and prototypical. The music is lush. Every thing and every person is emoting all over the place.

Really, a soap opera. The two murders and a cop as the male protagonist don't change that. If you want to see a Turkish soap opera, watch it; otherwise don't waste your time."

Out of Africa,"Roger Ebert wrote ""You Have to Be Very Talented to Be Working with Meryl Streep"". Sydney-Meryl Combo Rules!","Watching Meryl Streep in 2011's The Iron Lady and in 1985s Out of Africa gave me two different results. While in both of them, Meryl gave her best shot, the director's approach towards the actress is very different. In Out of Africa, Meryl's character Karen is a hardworking, independent, strong-willed young baroness/plantation worker later author, while in The Iron Lady, she oscillates between an eighty year old dementia-suffering Thatcher and a middle-aged Thatcher, both authoritative.

While I do understand Phyllida's attempt to have Meryl foreshadow others to show Thatcher's dominance, the movie itself became a one-woman show that barely gave a s*** about the supporting cast. While in Out of Africa, Pollock never resorts to showy camera work to highlight Meryl. The camera moves through the picturesque Africa and the beautiful Meryl so naturally as if the cameraman was lost in the beauty of the entire place. While Meryl is a marvel, Pollock himself is a wise man who gave the picture an independent existence. The Iron Lady will always remain Meryl's Iron Lady.

Based on a true story, Out of Africa shows Karen Blixen's life as she adjusts to the African lifestyle while romancing Denys (Redford) and divorcing Bror (Klaus). The opening itself talks of the farm at the foot of the Ngong Hills and is voiced by Streep in a very distinctive accent. Many of her performances, especially the ones where she uses accents, are slightly difficult to accept first but shine later, even though she does sound like Sly Stallone at times, especially when she says in one scene ""I want you to COME HOME"". Karen marries Bror to retain her title of baroness and moves to Africa. Bror uses her money against her wishes and doesn't take care of her properly. Karen meets Denys and another guy, and invites them to her home. Both the guys are attracted to her but things go awry for one. Denys and Karen fall in love but Denys lives a very different life, independent like Karen but in a nomadic way. Karen runs the entire farm, opens up a school and acquaints and adjusts herself with the Africans.

Pollack has handled the movie tactfully, and the film is enriched by fine performances. The green verdant lands of Africa with the pastoral huts of the Africans on one hand and the lavishness of the Britishers on the other can be seen. There is this lovely scene where the tribe chief tells Karen that only tall children will go to school. When Karen tells him that sending kids would be very wise of him, the African replies that the Britishers have learned to read, but it has not helped them in any way. Still, the farmers hold respect for Karen's caring nature.

Clocking at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Out of Africa is like a landscape of a beautiful bird on its mighty flight over the flowing rivers and the dense forests. My Rating: 8 out of 10"
Out of Africa,"Excellently made, Streep wonderful, Redford miscast","Fifty years ago I was living in the Kenya highlands, only a few miles from the old Blixen farm. Not a great deal had changed since the 1920s, the period of the movie, which manages a reasonable re-creation. However, the background is unlikely to mean much to Americans, only confirming unreal stereotypes of the colonial British. Meryl Steep, as we have come to expect, is superb in the part; and in 2003 she co-narrated a wonderful documentary on the remarkable Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen), to whom in fact she bears some physical resemblance. Robert Redford is badly miscast, and why the producers didn't get one of many superb English actors for the part I can't imagine. As a love story well told in what to most people will be an exotic setting, beautifully photographed, it should be highly rated, justifying its many awards."
Out of Africa,Tsavo Highway,"This really is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is outstanding. The Kenyan landscape is truly majestic. It's no wonder why the Forerunners chose Voi as their location for the portal to the Ark (Halo 3 reference ;)).

Robert Redford was the MAN in this, as I'm sure he is in real life. His free spirit that he simply would not yield was commendable. I don't know how he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award that year. Streep was very good too, and well deserving of her award.

At 2 hours and 41 minutes it felt a little long. I did not watch it through one sitting, and I think it would have been difficult had I done so.

Karen Blixen left Africa knowing exactly how special of a place it was. From the people to the animals and the land itself, there's nothing quite like it. I just hope we as the human race can preserve this precious place, and not the opposite."
Out of Africa,I had a farm in Africa,"What a memorable gem of a movie!! I thought this film deserved every one of its seven Academy Awards it got. After viewing this film again I'm just stupefied why didn't Meryl Streep win Best Actress in this movie. The role of Karen Blixen was very complex and she performed it beautifully. This is probably right up there with ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" both Award winning performances for her and this is right there with ""Bridges of Madison County"" and ""A Cry in the Dark"".

Syndey Pollock hit the nail right on the head with this classic beautiful cinematography. The acting is excellent by Streep, Redford, and Klaus Maria Brandeur. I liked the scene when Karen (Streep) wants her servant to address her by her name and he said ""You are Karen, Sabu"". I also loved the owl that she had in her room - it was a small one, but it was so cute and I loved it.

If you have a chance to rent this movie, please do - it is a classic. I love the beginning line ""I had a farm in Africa"" it was so moving!!"
Out of Africa,"wonderful cast, save one; glorious scenery - ""Out of Africa""","It's hard to describe this film. On one hand, it's long and slow; on the other, it's an absorbing story with fantastic acting and breathtaking scenery.

Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen, a Danish woman, who marries Bror Blixen and becomes a Baroness. The couple move to Africa in 1913 and start a coffee plantation.

Blixen cheats on her and is away often for business, while she stays at home working the plantation. Ultimately he gives her VD.

She falls in love with Denys Finch-Hatton (Robert Redford). The relationship is frustrating for her -- Denys does not want a commitment, he wanted freedom. When she returns to her native country, she writes about her experience as Isak Dinesen.

The film shows a lot of interesting history: the class consciousness, for one, as Karen was looked down on because of her humble beginnings. Also, it shows Europeans trying to impose their culture on a foreign people.

It definitely portrays how the different tribes saw the Europeans, basically as people who did not belong there.

It also shows the simplicity of the natives, and how their knowledge of their own country was superior. All of this is before World War II and very interesting.

Interestingly, Sikh Indians are brought to the English Gentlemen's club to act as servants and when Karen dares to enter the men's only den, it's the Sikh who is responsible for escorting her out; none of the English ""gentlemen"" have the balls or nerve to do it. An interesting observation on the English White man's view of the world before World War I.

Many of the lesser characters were real people. Kumante was apparently consulted by the filmmakers. Felicity is based on aviatrix Beryl Markham.

The cast includes Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Kitchen, Michael Gough, and Rachel Kempson, all wonderful actors.

Meryl Streep does a beautiful job as Karen/Isak. Robert Redford is miscast as Denys, who is supposed to be a British aristocrat. If he speaks with an American accent, he can't be a British aristocrat. Apparently Redford used an accent but Sydney Pollack made him overdub his lines; he thought they would distract the audience.

I think he should have been encouraged to work on and use the accent so his portrayal could have closer to the real man. As it is, he comes off as miscast -- and American. He also doesn't register as well as he could, given his looks and charm.

The scenery in this film is the true star. So many of us don't have a strong picture of Africa; this film displays its great beauty.

Interestingly, the story of Isak Dinesen was considered for Greta Garbo, and Audrey Hepburn was offered the role before Streep."
Out of Africa,A Dream of Africa,"My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, ""We've just seen the Academy Award winner."" If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile (case in point: the main theme playing as Denys Finch Hatton gives Karen Blixen her first airplane ride, and we what she sees, as God must have seen it). But these are merely the window dressings.

There are two movie cuts floating around, which I tried to pursue through Universal, and then Disney. Forget it. Suffice to say there is a theatrical version and a Disney TV version, with little consequential difference to the plot except that the latter edits out a little of Karen's physical lovemaking with Denys and slightly expands her intellectual relationship with Farah; which to some degree helped buttress the development of his absolute devotion to her.

The screenplay resembles Isaak Dinesen's semi-autobiographical book very little; even so, she did not tell the whole truth in her book. You'll have to get over it, except that I think the character development suffered the loss of Blixen's deep involvement with the displaced Kikuyu tribe working her coffee plantation. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion.

What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account and director Sydney Pollack's vision is still a beautiful love and adventure story in the midst of British colonial rule and an earlier, more racially and sexually biased era.

Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Bror von Blixen (whew! - who called Karen ""Tannen,"" adding to my initial confusion) perfectly portrays that fun man you like immensely but could never really trust with anything important like your feelings. He along with several of the key male figures and symbols in this movie will eventually bow in respect to the ""man"" Karen Blixen becomes despite his often shabby treatment and other travails, because she rises above it all and perseveres. Redford plays mostly Redford. His Finch Hatton's sense of independence is fragile and illusory and will ultimately cost him dearly.

There are a couple of continuity problems that bother me to this day, including the disappearing-reappearing champagne and the continually retracking parade marchers, but for the most part few expenses or attentions to detail were spared, especially in the lavish costuming. ""Bare-breasted native women"" will unfortunately also make their National Geographic appearance.

Even so, Out of Africa is a treasure with a half dozen or more perfect and unforgettable scenes; a movie as long as this review, but I hope you'll agree, worth your patience."
Out of Africa,Streep was great in this,"Meryl Streep conquers another accent and another role with her eyes closed. She personifies the strong willed Danish woman of Dineson's stories. As well rounded and as good as I have ever seen him is Robert Redford as the free spirited Denys Finch Hatton. Strong too is Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Von Blixen, the wayward husband, while Malick Bowens is a delight as Mrs Blixen's native 'man'.

To round the film off you add astute editing, glorious cinematography and John Barry's best ever musical score, and you have a marvellous picture. Director Sydney Pollack pulls it all together with a charm and style that seems effortless.

Definitely a movie you should try and see at the cinema of you get the chance. It may, for some, outstay its welcome a little, but epics are want to do this. Many viewers will rather wish it was not finishing so soon."
Out of Africa,Deserved praise?,"What makes a good film? It's funny I lent my DVD of this to a mate recently and although she didn't hate it she didn't get it either. Which surprised me because, to me, there has never been any doubt in my mind about the beauty and quality of this film. Anyway I was surfing IMDb and decided to look at this page. There is (or was) a thread on the discussion board about whether this was a good or bad film, I clicked on it. I have never (in my modest surfing of this site) seen such a big thread. Surely a film that evokes that much passion (the majority of which was positive and defencive) has achieved something.

I'm not saying that Out of Africa is the best film I've ever seen (I've yet to see that one!) but I think I can safely say that it has secured a place for itself both in cinematic history and the future of entertainment. You see at it heart it is a well made, timeless epic.

Yes there will always be the people who take exception to the accents, dislike the ending or believes it drags on for too long, but that's their lost, I can't help thinking they haven't been patient enough (and this annoys me).

You see the thing is in many ways the endless beauty of this film lies in its subtleties. Yes you have Meryl Streep and Redford flanked by the scenery and music, but for me it's the things like Pollock's direction, Michael Kitchen's performance and Karen's interaction with member's of the tribe that make the film.

Part of me wants to tie my mate to a chair and make her sit and watch this until she gets it. The other half is slightly relieved, because I feel that with her rejection this film is ever so slightly more exclusively mine, and I know that although I'm still only young I will always have time a space for it!"
Out of Africa,Great movie but incredibly slow as well,Comentario no disponible
Out of Africa,One of the Best Movies I have ever seen,"OUT OF AFRICA is based on the memoirs of Danish writer Karen Blixen (pen name, Isak Dinesen) in a coffee plantation in present day Kenya. It explains how this brave woman overcomes the stereotype of a dainty, colonial British lady by running the coffee farm while her husband Bror Blixen (Brandauer) led a life of hunting and infidelities. Meryl Streep is great as Karen Blixen. She manages to maintain the realistic Danish accent through the whole film. Redford is great as Denys Finch-Hatton, the Etonian hunter who keeps companion in her loneliest and hardest. But the real attraction of the film is he outstanding photography of the African landscape together with the sweeping John Barry soundtrack that is probably the most beautiful movie soundtrack of the 1980s. OUT OF AFRICA will be regarded as Sydney Pollack's asterpiece and a Classic of our times."
Out of Africa,a seemingly innocuous romantic movie of imperialism,"Everything in this movie is beautiful. Too beautiful to ignore the fact that the narrative is told from the white imperialist perspective. Africa and Africans are romanticized into the background of the protagonist's love story. However, it is not difficult to pin point the hidden imperialist agenda. Karen Blixen-Finecke represents a sympathetic missionary-style imperialist who eagerly tries to enlighten her African labor through Western education. Denys Finch Hatton is a pretentious environmentalist imperialist, who, on the one hand, tries to preserve the primitive Africanese in Africa (his criticism of Karen's project of building schools), on the other hand, exploits Africa for its economic resources. His two goals are not contradictory: in order to continue exploiting Africa, it has to remain primitive, both its people and its land. African people have no voice of their own in this movie. They are portrayed through the eyes of Karen and Denys. Their ultimate otherness provides an exotic catalyst for the romantic love story to develop. In turn, the innocuous story line of love helps justify the very disturbing and dark side of Western imperialism."
Out of Africa,Stunning,"This film is a masterpiece in all aspects. Of course, it's not for those looking for action or a fast-paced plot -- this film allows you to meet and get to know the characters with their virtues and foibles. The cinematography is incredible and John Barry's score is matchless; one of the very few scores which would diminish a film if absent. Meryl Streep was robbed of the Oscar; her meticulous German/Danish accent was first-rate. If I had to name the weakest attribute of the film, it's the casting of Robert Redford as Denys. He did a fine job, and it was understandable that he was cast in that role, due to his bankability, but in reality, Denys was not American. Redford is a bit too all-American for this role, but it's a minor detraction. This film is my next purchase on DVD -- I've seen it dozens of times and I never tire of it."
Out of Africa,mediocre eye candy,"This movie should not have won the Oscar for Best Picture. The fact that it did was either because it was a very bad year for movies (in which case, I don't think an award should be given for this category) or the academy, once again, voted for a bloated MEGA-picture despite it being sterile (there are MANY worse examples of this--think of The English Patient or The Last Emporer).

While I don't think it was even close to Oscar material, I also think a few reviews on this site are too harsh as well. Giving this picture a ""1""? Nope. This isn't fair, as the music and photography were great. I loved the African singing and the scene of the biplane flying over the flock of flamingos in incredible.

So, the final verdict: dull and unlikeable characters, a script that reads like fiction (not the real life story), unconvincing dialog BUT a treat for the eyes and ears. So my advice is to turn off your brain and enjoy--particularly on the big screen."
Out of Africa,Tedious Mediocrity,"Out of Africa' is a film that struggles to impress. It is loosely based on the memoirs of Danish aristocrat Karen Dinesen (Meryl Streep), whose failed social endeavors at home drove her to a platonic marriage to a Baron (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and to an eighteen-year exile in colonial Kenya. The wide skies of Africa enlarged Dinesen's horizons, allowing her to explore the limits of her endurance through business venturing, friendship, and ultimately romance with wildlife hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford).

The components of cinematic success are all there: erotic triangles, colonial Africa, exotic natives, even war, illness and bereavement. Paradoxically, after the first twenty minutes something goes terribly wrong, causing this over-ambitious film to evaporate into plain meaninglessness. The source of this unfortunate debacle is to be found in the substandard screenplay, which tends to revolve endlessly around itself, while stubbornly refusing to lift the story and the characters off the ground. Fine recitals by Streep (featuring a superb Nordic accent), and Michael Kitchen (as Berkeley) are not dynamic enough to conceal the film's fatal contradictions: Dinesen is a feminist spirit whose self-confidence is dependent on the men in her life; colonized Kenya is a sanitized paradise where noble savages' know their place; and where white colonialists are well-meaning philanthropists with imperfections that have hardly any impact outside of their narrow bwana' circle.

In conclusion, do not allow yourself to be deceived by the film's Academy Award credentials. This is mediocre cinema -the kind which pleases the eye, but is all empty calories. 4.7 stars out of 10."
Out of Africa,Beautiful,"I had heard of this film quite alot but had never seen it. Today I did and was amazed. It is based on the life of a danish female author who moves to Africa. Meryl Streep is exellent as the lead role and keeps a believable danish accent all the way through the film. Robert Redford is also excellent as. But of course the best feature of this film is the beautiful African scnery. It captivates the viewer and I think even if the acting was poor the scenery would still make you like the film. I cannot think of any other film I have seen that has matched this one. I recommened it to anyone. This truly is a touching, marvellous film"
Out of Africa,Episodic and overrated,"A story that is difficult to translate into a film without being episodic and a little bit direction-less. How many fireside scenes, meaningful pauses and plaintive longing gazes do we need to sit through to get the romantic undertows? Lots of subtlety in the script and visual symbolism inadequately matched by Robert Redford's neutral performance giving the impression of a huge American film-star doing it by numbers, conspicuously super-imposed onto an otherwise convincing depiction of colonial Kenyan culture in the early twentieth century. Director Sydney Pollack believed Redford gave the historic character he was portraying an unobtainable quality that couldn't be offered by any high-profile British actor at the time of filming (1984). Once the British acting fraternity recovered from the shock of being so unfairly patronized, they might, if given the chance, have cried out, ""Haven't you heard of Pierce Brosnan?"" Indeed, Brosnan's age in the early 1980's would have been much closer than Redford's to that of the historic character being portrayed. In fairness to Redford, he was apparently prepared to equip his character, an English gentleman, with a suitably Etonian accent. Pollack allegedly felt however than an English accent from Redford would distract the film's viewers. Hmmm. Yes, Mr Pollack. An Englishman with an American accent is so much less distracting and so much more believable. It's Meryl Streep who does the lion's share (no pun intended) of the heavy-lifting with able support from Michael Kitchen and others. Lots of beautiful photography and sweeping themes from veteran composer, John Barry. As a keen photographer once said to me however, ""Why is good photography allowed to be an excuse for a bad movie?"" I don't agree it's a bad movie but I do believe less is more and that the film needs a lot of tidying up with a tauter narrative. The truth is, I find it a curiously interesting albeit flawed film and wouldn't be surprised if I find myself enjoying it more upon repeat viewings."
Out of Africa,"You own nothing in Africa, Africa owns your soul ...",Comentario no disponible
Out of Africa,Top of the heap for this genre,"There is some marvelous symbolism in this film and the screenplay by Kurt Luedtke touches on much of it, but the enhanced DVD contains commentary by Isak Dinisen's biographer, Judith Thurman, as well as comments by director Sydney Pollack that provide additional insights into the characters that we don't necessarily see on screen. However, this doesn't detract from this immensely well-crafted film, so rich in texture and scope, that it accomplishes what all good movies do; it removes us from our world for the amount of time it's on the screen and immerses us in the milieu it creates. This films, not only because of the craftsmanship, for which John Barry also deserves exceptional recognition for a masterful music score, stands head and shoulders above the other blockbuster ""woman against the elements"" contemporary films of the time, such as 'Heat and Dust' and was obvious inspiration for other such hi-dollar period romances to follow like, ""The English Patient"" and ""The End of the Affair"". What makes this film really shine, however, is Streep's performance as Dinesen, at once both likable and empathetic due to her complete mastery of the art of screen acting, in which again, we forget we're watching a performance. Klaus Maria Brandauer is also excellent as the philandering Baron Blix...and Redford is Redford, perhaps, as some have suggested, a tad mis-cast, but still commanding and ultimately plausible as the conscious big-game hunter/conservationist, that he too is impossible to dislike. All in all, a film that truly enriches the overall experience of American cinema."
Out of Africa,Mostly excellent,"Pollack does an excellent job but there is a lot of patching and fiddling with facts. He has to work within the limitations of the format and running time, but he does make the very best of it. I would like to see a remake in the format of a well-financed five-part miniseries that truly delves into both the Dinesen book and into Shadows on the Grass. I wish that they had hired an Englishman to play Finch Haton. Redford was great, but he wasn't much like the real person. Also, the film doesn't touch on Blixen's aristocratic nature, or how she served as an adjudicator of disputes alongside Kinyanjui, and you don't get a feel for the geography of the farm itself or its location in relation to the fantastic views that were available, such as going up the Ng'ongs and peering down into the beginnings of the Great Rift Valley, or looking in the other direction and seeing the Athi Plain, and then looking east and seeing the entirety of the farm below. As for the relationship between Blixen and Finch Haton, and that between his and his other lady friends, this was very different from the reality. Having lived there during the filming, and only three minutes from Karen's house, this reviewer may feel somewhat possessive about his fellow expat and her real story, Setting all that aside, it is a very good movie. It tells a good tale and the actors turn in fine performances."
Out of Africa,"A true tale, brimming with cinematic confidence","Released in 1985 and directed by Sydney Pollack based on Karen Blixen's autobiographical novel, ""Out of Africa"" chronicles life in colonial Kenya during World War I where a Danish baroness establishes a coffee plantation with her husband-of-convenience, Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer), and develops a relationship with a free-spirited big-game hunter, Denys (Robert Redford).

For some reason it's become fashionable to look-down on ""Out of Africa"" but, viewing it recently, it's obvious why it won Best Picture at the AA. This is a historical drama/romance with elements of adventure that just brims with confidence. Watching it, you're swept back in time to WWI-era Kenya. The writing and acting are thoroughly convincing. Take, for instance, the parting moment Karen has with Farah (Malick Bowens) at the end; it's low-key but dramatically potent. Sure, there are some slow parts, but that's the nature of the beast. If you want cartoony jungle action, like ""Predator,"" ""Out of Africa"" won't work; but if you want realistic historical drama akin to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""Nowhere in Africa"" (2001), ""Out of Africa"" expertly fills the bill.

The film runs 161 minutes and was shot in Kenya (e.g. Shaba National Game Reserve) and England (e.g Castle Rising, Norfolk).

GRADE: B+"
Out of Africa,The One that got away!,"This was a film that when it came out for some unknown reason I never saw. Over the years it has passed me by many, many times either in people's conversations or midnight wanderings with the remote but always I let it go by. Maybe it was the fact that it won such acclaim and attention and was talked about so much that I thought I knew the film, that I didn't need to see it. There was always another film to see. Well obviously my 'mistake' was rectified as I wouldn't be writing this now. I came home to find my girlfriend watching the very beginning, proceeded to read the day's newspaper but had one eye on the screen. She had seen it a few times and later on tiring went to bed. I'm not sure why this time was different but I continued to watch. Thank god I did. This is a magnificent, intelligent, moving film that on this night of 6th August 2007 means so much more to me than had I seen it in 1985. Of course now I realize why I've been so averse although unconsciously of seeing it. Going through a bloody divorce then not of my own choosing I don't think could have handled as Meryl so brilliantly did the strength that her character had with love and all it's attachment. This is human film that really seeps into your soul and I'm full of admiration for Sidney Pollack's brilliance and for putting together a team of people both in front and behind the camera that have created such a gem. All the Actors were superb with Meryl setting the pace like a long distance runner wanting to cross the line with everyone winning! This is a film with a strong heart!"

Out of Africa,A Good Woman In Africa,"This is an overlong film derived from Isak Dinesen's memoirs of running a coffee plantation in Kenya in the early years of the twentieth century. The book is a different kettle of fish altogether, but I won't go into that. Sydney Pollock does a fine job of directing here, but in a way the movie is almost overproduced. There was, it seems, so much time and money to play with that the film drags an awful lot. Kurt Luedtke's script is laconic in the Hemingway manner, and very smart, though some of the ultra-sophisticated one-liners began to irritate me after a while. Pollock has a fine dramatic instinct and I wish that there was more drama in this film for him to lavish his talent on. The location shooting is superb, and the depiction of home and village life in colonial Africa is nicely done. I find the romance between Dinesen (called by her real name, Baroness Karen Blixen) and aviator-adventurer Denis Finch-Hatton, less than compelling, partly because, as the latter, Robert Redford refuses to use a British accent, which gives the movie a Hollywood feel, not a bad thing in itself, but the film was made in Africa, with a mostly British cast, and Meryl Streep as Blixen uses an impeccable Danish accent, which makes Redford seem like a fish out of water. This is bothersome because in many ways Redford is well cast in the role, thus his American diction seems like sheer willfulness on his part, which it probably was. Streep is fine in her role, and is especially good in her grand dame moments, as lady of the manor.

There are some worthwhile incidental pleasures in this film. John Barry's fine score is perfect for the material, and really soars near the end, appropriately I imagine since one of the two main characters is an aviator. In supporting roles, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Kitchen, Suzanna Hamilton and Michael Gough work small wonders. The use of Mozart, while true to life, makes this post-Amadeus film seem already like a period piece; the period being the 1980's. Mozart was all the rage in those days. His great music is, however, non- if not anti-emotional, and it's odd that it was used so often in the movie. The effect of the music is somewhat intimidating in the context of the romance at the center of the film, as it doesn't suit at all what's happening on screen, which can't help but make the viewer think that perhaps he's missing something; or maybe the film is just too smart for him. This is, again, a very eighties sort of feeling, of the sort of one gets from watching Chariots Of Fire, or listening to the music David Byrne and Laurie Anderson."
Out of Africa,Acting it out,"The movie starts off really good. And the actors continue on that high rhythm they have going on. There is not that many surprises going on relationship-wise between them, so the tension is build by them acting so good. The problem being, that the movie takes its time. And when I say takes its time, I mean it takes a very long time ... very very long time to get to the end.

The story does not offer that much substance for the running time. And the points are being made clear long before the scenes are over. Still it opts not to crank up the speed. While the human relationships are the ones that keep the movie together (with the superb acting), I couldn't help but feel that the movie could have been cut to tighter running time, without anyone really missing too much"

Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,"Roger Ebert wrote ""You Have to Be Very Talented to Be Working with Meryl Streep"". Sydney-Meryl Combo Rules!","Watching Meryl Streep in 2011's The Iron Lady and in 1985s Out of Africa gave me two different results. While in both of them, Meryl gave her best shot, the director's approach towards the actress is very different. In Out of Africa, Meryl's character Karen is a hardworking, independent, strong-willed young baroness/plantation worker later author, while in The Iron Lady, she oscillates between an eighty year old dementia-suffering Thatcher and a middle-aged Thatcher, both authoritative.

While I do understand Phyllida's attempt to have Meryl foreshadow others to show Thatcher's dominance, the movie itself became a one-woman show that barely gave a s*** about the supporting cast. While in Out of Africa, Pollock never resorts to showy camera work to highlight Meryl. The camera moves through the picturesque Africa and the beautiful Meryl so naturally as if the cameraman was lost in the beauty of the entire place. While Meryl is a marvel, Pollock himself is a wise man who gave the picture an independent existence. The Iron Lady will always remain Meryl's Iron Lady.

Based on a true story, Out of Africa shows Karen Blixen's life as she adjusts to the African lifestyle while romancing Denys (Redford) and divorcing Bror (Klaus). The opening itself talks of the farm at the foot of the Ngong Hills and is voiced by Streep in a very distinctive accent. Many of her performances, especially the ones where she uses accents, are slightly difficult to accept first but shine later, even though she does sound like Sly Stallone at times, especially when she says in one scene ""I want you to COME HOME"". Karen marries Bror to retain her title of baroness and moves to Africa. Bror uses her money against her wishes and doesn't take care of her properly. Karen meets Denys and another guy, and invites them to her home. Both the guys are attracted to her but things go awry for one. Denys and Karen fall in love but Denys lives a very different life, independent like Karen but in a nomadic way. Karen runs the entire farm, opens up a school and acquaints and adjusts herself with the Africans.

Pollack has handled the movie tactfully, and the film is enriched by fine performances. The green verdant lands of Africa with the pastoral huts of the Africans on one hand and the lavishness of the Britishers on the other can be seen. There is this lovely scene where the tribe chief tells Karen that only tall children will go to school. When Karen tells him that sending kids would be very wise of him, the African replies that the Britishers have learned to read, but it has not helped them in any way. Still, the farmers hold respect for Karen's caring nature.

Clocking at 2 hours and 40 minutes, Out of Africa is like a landscape of a beautiful bird on its mighty flight over the flowing rivers and the dense forests. My Rating: 8 out of 10"
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,"Excellently made, Streep wonderful, Redford miscast","Fifty years ago I was living in the Kenya highlands, only a few miles from the old Blixen farm. Not a great deal had changed since the 1920s, the period of the movie, which manages a reasonable re-creation. However, the background is unlikely to mean much to Americans, only confirming unreal stereotypes of the colonial British. Meryl Steep, as we have come to expect, is superb in the part; and in 2003 she co-narrated a wonderful documentary on the remarkable Karen Blixen (Isak Dinesen), to whom in fact she bears some physical resemblance. Robert Redford is badly miscast, and why the producers didn't get one of many superb English actors for the part I can't imagine. As a love story well told in what to most people will be an exotic setting, beautifully photographed, it should be highly rated, justifying its many awards."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Tsavo Highway,"This really is a beautiful movie. The cinematography is outstanding. The Kenyan landscape is truly majestic. It's no wonder why the Forerunners chose Voi as their location for the portal to the Ark (Halo 3 reference ;)).

Robert Redford was the MAN in this, as I'm sure he is in real life. His free spirit that he simply would not yield was commendable. I don't know how he wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award that year. Streep was very good too, and well deserving of her award.

At 2 hours and 41 minutes it felt a little long. I did not watch it through one sitting, and I think it would have been difficult had I done so.

Karen Blixen left Africa knowing exactly how special of a place it was. From the people to the animals and the land itself, there's nothing quite like it. I just hope we as the human race can preserve this precious place, and not the opposite."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,I had a farm in Africa,"What a memorable gem of a movie!! I thought this film deserved every one of its seven Academy Awards it got. After viewing this film again I'm just stupefied why didn't Meryl Streep win Best Actress in this movie. The role of Karen Blixen was very complex and she performed it beautifully. This is probably right up there with ""Sophie's Choice"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" both Award winning performances for her and this is right there with ""Bridges of Madison County"" and ""A Cry in the Dark"".

Syndey Pollock hit the nail right on the head with this classic beautiful cinematography. The acting is excellent by Streep, Redford, and Klaus Maria Brandeur. I liked the scene when Karen (Streep) wants her servant to address her by her name and he said ""You are Karen, Sabu"". I also loved the owl that she had in her room - it was a small one, but it was so cute and I loved it.

If you have a chance to rent this movie, please do - it is a classic. I love the beginning line ""I had a farm in Africa"" it was so moving!!"
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,"wonderful cast, save one; glorious scenery - ""Out of Africa""","It's hard to describe this film. On one hand, it's long and slow; on the other, it's an absorbing story with fantastic acting and breathtaking scenery.

Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen, a Danish woman, who marries Bror Blixen and becomes a Baroness. The couple move to Africa in 1913 and start a coffee plantation.

Blixen cheats on her and is away often for business, while she stays at home working the plantation. Ultimately he gives her VD.

She falls in love with Denys Finch-Hatton (Robert Redford). The relationship is frustrating for her -- Denys does not want a commitment, he wanted freedom. When she returns to her native country, she writes about her experience as Isak Dinesen.

The film shows a lot of interesting history: the class consciousness, for one, as Karen was looked down on because of her humble beginnings. Also, it shows Europeans trying to impose their culture on a foreign people.

It definitely portrays how the different tribes saw the Europeans, basically as people who did not belong there.

It also shows the simplicity of the natives, and how their knowledge of their own country was superior. All of this is before World War II and very interesting.

Interestingly, Sikh Indians are brought to the English Gentlemen's club to act as servants and when Karen dares to enter the men's only den, it's the Sikh who is responsible for escorting her out; none of the English ""gentlemen"" have the balls or nerve to do it. An interesting observation on the English White man's view of the world before World War I.

Many of the lesser characters were real people. Kumante was apparently consulted by the filmmakers. Felicity is based on aviatrix Beryl Markham.

The cast includes Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Kitchen, Michael Gough, and Rachel Kempson, all wonderful actors.

Meryl Streep does a beautiful job as Karen/Isak. Robert Redford is miscast as Denys, who is supposed to be a British aristocrat. If he speaks with an American accent, he can't be a British aristocrat. Apparently Redford used an accent but Sydney Pollack made him overdub his lines; he thought they would distract the audience.

I think he should have been encouraged to work on and use the accent so his portrayal could have closer to the real man. As it is, he comes off as miscast -- and American. He also doesn't register as well as he could, given his looks and charm.

The scenery in this film is the true star. So many of us don't have a strong picture of Africa; this film displays its great beauty.

Interestingly, the story of Isak Dinesen was considered for Greta Garbo, and Audrey Hepburn was offered the role before Streep."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,A Dream of Africa,"My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, ""We've just seen the Academy Award winner."" If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile (case in point: the main theme playing as Denys Finch Hatton gives Karen Blixen her first airplane ride, and we what she sees, as God must have seen it). But these are merely the window dressings.

There are two movie cuts floating around, which I tried to pursue through Universal, and then Disney. Forget it. Suffice to say there is a theatrical version and a Disney TV version, with little consequential difference to the plot except that the latter edits out a little of Karen's physical lovemaking with Denys and slightly expands her intellectual relationship with Farah; which to some degree helped buttress the development of his absolute devotion to her.

The screenplay resembles Isaak Dinesen's semi-autobiographical book very little; even so, she did not tell the whole truth in her book. You'll have to get over it, except that I think the character development suffered the loss of Blixen's deep involvement with the displaced Kikuyu tribe working her coffee plantation. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion.

What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account and director Sydney Pollack's vision is still a beautiful love and adventure story in the midst of British colonial rule and an earlier, more racially and sexually biased era.

Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Bror von Blixen (whew! - who called Karen ""Tannen,"" adding to my initial confusion) perfectly portrays that fun man you like immensely but could never really trust with anything important like your feelings. He along with several of the key male figures and symbols in this movie will eventually bow in respect to the ""man"" Karen Blixen becomes despite his often shabby treatment and other travails, because she rises above it all and perseveres. Redford plays mostly Redford. His Finch Hatton's sense of independence is fragile and illusory and will ultimately cost him dearly.

There are a couple of continuity problems that bother me to this day, including the disappearing-reappearing champagne and the continually retracking parade marchers, but for the most part few expenses or attentions to detail were spared, especially in the lavish costuming. ""Bare-breasted native women"" will unfortunately also make their National Geographic appearance.

Even so, Out of Africa is a treasure with a half dozen or more perfect and unforgettable scenes; a movie as long as this review, but I hope you'll agree, worth your patience."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Streep was great in this,"Meryl Streep conquers another accent and another role with her eyes closed. She personifies the strong willed Danish woman of Dineson's stories. As well rounded and as good as I have ever seen him is Robert Redford as the free spirited Denys Finch Hatton. Strong too is Klaus Maria Brandauer as Baron Von Blixen, the wayward husband, while Malick Bowens is a delight as Mrs Blixen's native 'man'.

To round the film off you add astute editing, glorious cinematography and John Barry's best ever musical score, and you have a marvellous picture. Director Sydney Pollack pulls it all together with a charm and style that seems effortless.

Definitely a movie you should try and see at the cinema of you get the chance. It may, for some, outstay its welcome a little, but epics are want to do this. Many viewers will rather wish it was not finishing so soon."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Deserved praise?,"What makes a good film? It's funny I lent my DVD of this to a mate recently and although she didn't hate it she didn't get it either. Which surprised me because, to me, there has never been any doubt in my mind about the beauty and quality of this film. Anyway I was surfing IMDb and decided to look at this page. There is (or was) a thread on the discussion board about whether this was a good or bad film, I clicked on it. I have never (in my modest surfing of this site) seen such a big thread. Surely a film that evokes that much passion (the majority of which was positive and defencive) has achieved something.

I'm not saying that Out of Africa is the best film I've ever seen (I've yet to see that one!) but I think I can safely say that it has secured a place for itself both in cinematic history and the future of entertainment. You see at it heart it is a well made, timeless epic.

Yes there will always be the people who take exception to the accents, dislike the ending or believes it drags on for too long, but that's their lost, I can't help thinking they haven't been patient enough (and this annoys me).

You see the thing is in many ways the endless beauty of this film lies in its subtleties. Yes you have Meryl Streep and Redford flanked by the scenery and music, but for me it's the things like Pollock's direction, Michael Kitchen's performance and Karen's interaction with member's of the tribe that make the film.

Part of me wants to tie my mate to a chair and make her sit and watch this until she gets it. The other half is slightly relieved, because I feel that with her rejection this film is ever so slightly more exclusively mine, and I know that although I'm still only young I will always have time a space for it!"

Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,One of the Best Movies I have ever seen,"OUT OF AFRICA is based on the memoirs of Danish writer Karen Blixen (pen name, Isak Dinesen) in a coffee plantation in present day Kenya. It explains how this brave woman overcomes the stereotype of a dainty, colonial British lady by running the coffee farm while her husband Bror Blixen (Brandauer) led a life of hunting and infidelities. Meryl Streep is great as Karen Blixen. She manages to maintain the realistic Danish accent through the whole film. Redford is great as Denys Finch-Hatton, the Etonian hunter who keeps companion in her loneliest and hardest. But the real attraction of the film is he outstanding photography of the African landscape together with the sweeping John Barry soundtrack that is probably the most beautiful movie soundtrack of the 1980s. OUT OF AFRICA will be regarded as Sydney Pollack's asterpiece and a Classic of our times."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,a seemingly innocuous romantic movie of imperialism,"Everything in this movie is beautiful. Too beautiful to ignore the fact that the narrative is told from the white imperialist perspective. Africa and Africans are romanticized into the background of the protagonist's love story. However, it is not difficult to pin point the hidden imperialist agenda. Karen Blixen-Finecke represents a sympathetic missionary-style imperialist who eagerly tries to enlighten her African labor through Western education. Denys Finch Hatton is a pretentious environmentalist imperialist, who, on the one hand, tries to preserve the primitive Africanese in Africa (his criticism of Karen's project of building schools), on the other hand, exploits Africa for its economic resources. His two goals are not contradictory: in order to continue exploiting Africa, it has to remain primitive, both its people and its land. African people have no voice of their own in this movie. They are portrayed through the eyes of Karen and Denys. Their ultimate otherness provides an exotic catalyst for the romantic love story to develop. In turn, the innocuous story line of love helps justify the very disturbing and dark side of Western imperialism."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Stunning,"This film is a masterpiece in all aspects. Of course, it's not for those looking for action or a fast-paced plot -- this film allows you to meet and get to know the characters with their virtues and foibles. The cinematography is incredible and John Barry's score is matchless; one of the very few scores which would diminish a film if absent. Meryl Streep was robbed of the Oscar; her meticulous German/Danish accent was first-rate. If I had to name the weakest attribute of the film, it's the casting of Robert Redford as Denys. He did a fine job, and it was understandable that he was cast in that role, due to his bankability, but in reality, Denys was not American. Redford is a bit too all-American for this role, but it's a minor detraction. This film is my next purchase on DVD -- I've seen it dozens of times and I never tire of it."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,mediocre eye candy,"This movie should not have won the Oscar for Best Picture. The fact that it did was either because it was a very bad year for movies (in which case, I don't think an award should be given for this category) or the academy, once again, voted for a bloated MEGA-picture despite it being sterile (there are MANY worse examples of this--think of The English Patient or The Last Emporer).

While I don't think it was even close to Oscar material, I also think a few reviews on this site are too harsh as well. Giving this picture a ""1""? Nope. This isn't fair, as the music and photography were great. I loved the African singing and the scene of the biplane flying over the flock of flamingos in incredible.

So, the final verdict: dull and unlikeable characters, a script that reads like fiction (not the real life story), unconvincing dialog BUT a treat for the eyes and ears. So my advice is to turn off your brain and enjoy--particularly on the big screen."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Tedious Mediocrity,"Out of Africa' is a film that struggles to impress. It is loosely based on the memoirs of Danish aristocrat Karen Dinesen (Meryl Streep), whose failed social endeavors at home drove her to a platonic marriage to a Baron (Klaus Maria Brandauer) and to an eighteen-year exile in colonial Kenya. The wide skies of Africa enlarged Dinesen's horizons, allowing her to explore the limits of her endurance through business venturing, friendship, and ultimately romance with wildlife hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford).

The components of cinematic success are all there: erotic triangles, colonial Africa, exotic natives, even war, illness and bereavement. Paradoxically, after the first twenty minutes something goes terribly wrong, causing this over-ambitious film to evaporate into plain meaninglessness. The source of this unfortunate debacle is to be found in the substandard screenplay, which tends to revolve endlessly around itself, while stubbornly refusing to lift the story and the characters off the ground. Fine recitals by Streep (featuring a superb Nordic accent), and Michael Kitchen (as Berkeley) are not dynamic enough to conceal the film's fatal contradictions: Dinesen is a feminist spirit whose self-confidence is dependent on the men in her life; colonized Kenya is a sanitized paradise where noble savages' know their place; and where white colonialists are well-meaning philanthropists with imperfections that have hardly any impact outside of their narrow bwana' circle.

In conclusion, do not allow yourself to be deceived by the film's Academy Award credentials. This is mediocre cinema -the kind which pleases the eye, but is all empty calories. 4.7 stars out of 10."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Beautiful,"I had heard of this film quite alot but had never seen it. Today I did and was amazed. It is based on the life of a danish female author who moves to Africa. Meryl Streep is exellent as the lead role and keeps a believable danish accent all the way through the film. Robert Redford is also excellent as. But of course the best feature of this film is the beautiful African scnery. It captivates the viewer and I think even if the acting was poor the scenery would still make you like the film. I cannot think of any other film I have seen that has matched this one. I recommened it to anyone. This truly is a touching, marvellous film"
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Episodic and overrated,"A story that is difficult to translate into a film without being episodic and a little bit direction-less. How many fireside scenes, meaningful pauses and plaintive longing gazes do we need to sit through to get the romantic undertows? Lots of subtlety in the script and visual symbolism inadequately matched by Robert Redford's neutral performance giving the impression of a huge American film-star doing it by numbers, conspicuously super-imposed onto an otherwise convincing depiction of colonial Kenyan culture in the early twentieth century. Director Sydney Pollack believed Redford gave the historic character he was portraying an unobtainable quality that couldn't be offered by any high-profile British actor at the time of filming (1984). Once the British acting fraternity recovered from the shock of being so unfairly patronized, they might, if given the chance, have cried out, ""Haven't you heard of Pierce Brosnan?"" Indeed, Brosnan's age in the early 1980's would have been much closer than Redford's to that of the historic character being portrayed. In fairness to Redford, he was apparently prepared to equip his character, an English gentleman, with a suitably Etonian accent. Pollack allegedly felt however than an English accent from Redford would distract the film's viewers. Hmmm. Yes, Mr Pollack. An Englishman with an American accent is so much less distracting and so much more believable. It's Meryl Streep who does the lion's share (no pun intended) of the heavy-lifting with able support from Michael Kitchen and others. Lots of beautiful photography and sweeping themes from veteran composer, John Barry. As a keen photographer once said to me however, ""Why is good photography allowed to be an excuse for a bad movie?"" I don't agree it's a bad movie but I do believe less is more and that the film needs a lot of tidying up with a tauter narrative. The truth is, I find it a curiously interesting albeit flawed film and wouldn't be surprised if I find myself enjoying it more upon repeat viewings."

Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Top of the heap for this genre,"There is some marvelous symbolism in this film and the screenplay by Kurt Luedtke touches on much of it, but the enhanced DVD contains commentary by Isak Dinisen's biographer, Judith Thurman, as well as comments by director Sydney Pollack that provide additional insights into the characters that we don't necessarily see on screen. However, this doesn't detract from this immensely well-crafted film, so rich in texture and scope, that it accomplishes what all good movies do; it removes us from our world for the amount of time it's on the screen and immerses us in the milieu it creates. This films, not only because of the craftsmanship, for which John Barry also deserves exceptional recognition for a masterful music score, stands head and shoulders above the other blockbuster ""woman against the elements"" contemporary films of the time, such as 'Heat and Dust' and was obvious inspiration for other such hi-dollar period romances to follow like, ""The English Patient"" and ""The End of the Affair"". What makes this film really shine, however, is Streep's performance as Dinesen, at once both likable and empathetic due to her complete mastery of the art of screen acting, in which again, we forget we're watching a performance. Klaus Maria Brandauer is also excellent as the philandering Baron Blix...and Redford is Redford, perhaps, as some have suggested, a tad mis-cast, but still commanding and ultimately plausible as the conscious big-game hunter/conservationist, that he too is impossible to dislike. All in all, a film that truly enriches the overall experience of American cinema."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Mostly excellent,"Pollack does an excellent job but there is a lot of patching and fiddling with facts. He has to work within the limitations of the format and running time, but he does make the very best of it. I would like to see a remake in the format of a well-financed five-part miniseries that truly delves into both the Dinesen book and into Shadows on the Grass. I wish that they had hired an Englishman to play Finch Haton. Redford was great, but he wasn't much like the real person. Also, the film doesn't touch on Blixen's aristocratic nature, or how she served as an adjudicator of disputes alongside Kinyanjui, and you don't get a feel for the geography of the farm itself or its location in relation to the fantastic views that were available, such as going up the Ng'ongs and peering down into the beginnings of the Great Rift Valley, or looking in the other direction and seeing the Athi Plain, and then looking east and seeing the entirety of the farm below. As for the relationship between Blixen and Finch Haton, and that between his and his other lady friends, this was very different from the reality. Having lived there during the filming, and only three minutes from Karen's house, this reviewer may feel somewhat possessive about his fellow expat and her real story, Setting all that aside, it is a very good movie. It tells a good tale and the actors turn in fine performances."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,"A true tale, brimming with cinematic confidence","Released in 1985 and directed by Sydney Pollack based on Karen Blixen's autobiographical novel, ""Out of Africa"" chronicles life in colonial Kenya during World War I where a Danish baroness establishes a coffee plantation with her husband-of-convenience, Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer), and develops a relationship with a free-spirited big-game hunter, Denys (Robert Redford).

For some reason it's become fashionable to look-down on ""Out of Africa"" but, viewing it recently, it's obvious why it won Best Picture at the AA. This is a historical drama/romance with elements of adventure that just brims with confidence. Watching it, you're swept back in time to WWI-era Kenya. The writing and acting are thoroughly convincing. Take, for instance, the parting moment Karen has with Farah (Malick Bowens) at the end; it's low-key but dramatically potent. Sure, there are some slow parts, but that's the nature of the beast. If you want cartoony jungle action, like ""Predator,"" ""Out of Africa"" won't work; but if you want realistic historical drama akin to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""Nowhere in Africa"" (2001), ""Out of Africa"" expertly fills the bill.

The film runs 161 minutes and was shot in Kenya (e.g. Shaba National Game Reserve) and England (e.g Castle Rising, Norfolk).

Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,The One that got away!,"This was a film that when it came out for some unknown reason I never saw. Over the years it has passed me by many, many times either in people's conversations or midnight wanderings with the remote but always I let it go by. Maybe it was the fact that it won such acclaim and attention and was talked about so much that I thought I knew the film, that I didn't need to see it. There was always another film to see. Well obviously my 'mistake' was rectified as I wouldn't be writing this now. I came home to find my girlfriend watching the very beginning, proceeded to read the day's newspaper but had one eye on the screen. She had seen it a few times and later on tiring went to bed. I'm not sure why this time was different but I continued to watch. Thank god I did. This is a magnificent, intelligent, moving film that on this night of 6th August 2007 means so much more to me than had I seen it in 1985. Of course now I realize why I've been so averse although unconsciously of seeing it. Going through a bloody divorce then not of my own choosing I don't think could have handled as Meryl so brilliantly did the strength that her character had with love and all it's attachment. This is human film that really seeps into your soul and I'm full of admiration for Sidney Pollack's brilliance and for putting together a team of people both in front and behind the camera that have created such a gem. All the Actors were superb with Meryl setting the pace like a long distance runner wanting to cross the line with everyone winning! This is a film with a strong heart!"

Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,A Good Woman In Africa,"This is an overlong film derived from Isak Dinesen's memoirs of running a coffee plantation in Kenya in the early years of the twentieth century. The book is a different kettle of fish altogether, but I won't go into that. Sydney Pollock does a fine job of directing here, but in a way the movie is almost overproduced. There was, it seems, so much time and money to play with that the film drags an awful lot. Kurt Luedtke's script is laconic in the Hemingway manner, and very smart, though some of the ultra-sophisticated one-liners began to irritate me after a while. Pollock has a fine dramatic instinct and I wish that there was more drama in this film for him to lavish his talent on. The location shooting is superb, and the depiction of home and village life in colonial Africa is nicely done. I find the romance between Dinesen (called by her real name, Baroness Karen Blixen) and aviator-adventurer Denis Finch-Hatton, less than compelling, partly because, as the latter, Robert Redford refuses to use a British accent, which gives the movie a Hollywood feel, not a bad thing in itself, but the film was made in Africa, with a mostly British cast, and Meryl Streep as Blixen uses an impeccable Danish accent, which makes Redford seem like a fish out of water. This is bothersome because in many ways Redford is well cast in the role, thus his American diction seems like sheer willfulness on his part, which it probably was. Streep is fine in her role, and is especially good in her grand dame moments, as lady of the manor.

There are some worthwhile incidental pleasures in this film. John Barry's fine score is perfect for the material, and really soars near the end, appropriately I imagine since one of the two main characters is an aviator. In supporting roles, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Michael Kitchen, Suzanna Hamilton and Michael Gough work small wonders. The use of Mozart, while true to life, makes this post-Amadeus film seem already like a period piece; the period being the 1980's. Mozart was all the rage in those days. His great music is, however, non- if not anti-emotional, and it's odd that it was used so often in the movie. The effect of the music is somewhat intimidating in the context of the romance at the center of the film, as it doesn't suit at all what's happening on screen, which can't help but make the viewer think that perhaps he's missing something; or maybe the film is just too smart for him. This is, again, a very eighties sort of feeling, of the sort of one gets from watching Chariots Of Fire, or listening to the music David Byrne and Laurie Anderson."
Dragons: Rescue Riders: Hunt for the Golden Dragon,Acting it out,"The movie starts off really good. And the actors continue on that high rhythm they have going on. There is not that many surprises going on relationship-wise between them, so the tension is build by them acting so good. The problem being, that the movie takes its time. And when I say takes its time, I mean it takes a very long time ... very very long time to get to the end.

The story does not offer that much substance for the running time. And the points are being made clear long before the scenes are over. Still it opts not to crank up the speed. While the human relationships are the ones that keep the movie together (with the superb acting), I couldn't help but feel that the movie could have been cut to tighter running time, without anyone really missing too much"

Sab el-Burumbah,,
Anima,Hypnotically poignant,"An imaginative and thought provoking piece of contemporary interpretive dance set to the music of Thom Yorke - our should that be the other way around? The point is, the music and dance really one single piece of beautifully crafted art, making you think about life's struggles and how different they might be if you find the right person to share them with."
Anima,I don't like the drugs but the drugs like this...,"What do you get when you combine the music of Radiohead's Thom Yorke and the imagery of Paul Thomas Anderson (Phantom Thread, Magnolia) with choreography by Damien Jalet (Suspiria)? You get one hell of a visual treat that blows your senses away.

Set in a dystopian world where a tired and disheveled Thom Yorke is joined in a choreograph of movements by other fellow passengers on a train. There he catches the eye of a fellow passenger and thus begins his long lost journey to get to her.

Three songs from Yorke's new album, ANIMA, are combined to create this spellbinding fifteen minutes, with the camera angles capturing the inventive and unique choreography perfectly. The set design and art direction are effective thanks to the cinematography, And Yorke does give a fine performance, with his twitching eye stealing the show!"
Anima,Don't Mistake This For Music Video,"This is the work of artists who wish to express something elemental in human nature.

I can't say for sure I know what they had in mind exactly, or what another person might experience from their viewing; what I can say is that it is masterly work and for me it's about connection.

The last time I saw something this affecting was Michael Dudok De Wit's The Red Turtle; Anima is every bit as life affirming (even though it may evoke tears).

There's little point in elaborating on plot points and such because that's not what work like this is about; it's something to be experienced at a near subconscious level.

I will very likely watch this for a long time to come: many times over.

Mr Yorke, Mr Anderson; Thank You."
Anima,When the subtext hits...,"I bawled my eyes out! So did my wife. There is always more than meets the eye (and ear) with both PT Anderson and Thom, and this truly is a masterpiece fitting of their filmographies. Knowing a bit about Mr Yorke and what he has been through in the last few years can make for some supremely heart breaking stuff, and Anima is just about the most perfect love letter ever written. This is art, real art 😭"
Anima,Interesting,"Interesting visuals, interesting choreography, interesting music, I was thoroughly entertained."
Anima,Interesting,"Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, The Master) and with music written and performed by Thom Yorke of Radiohead, Anima is hard to describe. Calling it simply a music video is an understatement. It is more than a visual promotion for a song, with the visual aspects have as much, if not more, of a meaning than the music. Besides it's 15 minutes long!

The finished product is interesting and reasonably entertaining. Not brilliant or compelling, but not a bad way to spend 15 minutes."
Anima,Like listening to a painting,Lovely visuals by PTA and artsy sound by Thom.. Enjoyable audio-visual journey that reminded me of the old days when people cared about videos that work with the music.
Anima,True Love Waits,"Following ""Licorice Pizza"", I have decided that the time is right for a PTA retrospective. I'm not going to watch all the music videos, but I am going to try for some, if not all, of the short films - starting with the most recent, and easiest to find ""Anima"" a collaboration with Radiohead's Thom Yorke, that is readily available on Netflix.

The short is a choreographed expressive dance piece, linked to three songs from Yorke's solo album ""Anima"" so the narrative is a little open to interpretation, but it concerns Thom (Thom Yorke) who meets a girl (Dajana Roncione) on the train. He attempts to return her forgotten lunch pail to her but is caught in a cycle of systems and routines that keep them apart. Though he catches glimpses across his day, he's unable to get close to her. The routines and oppression are expressed by brutalist concrete architecture, singular black outfits and the dances.

I think your tolerance for this is probably going to depend very much on how much you enjoy Radiohead's later work, as Yorke and producer Nigel Godrich provide the score and it's the sort of electronic soundscape that we've come to expect from those albums, and from Yorke solo work.

I don't have much of an interest in dance in any form, particularly this form of expressive work, but still I think even I could tell that the chorography was clever and helped to tell the love story that the short was providing. Having initially though that Yorke might, because of his character in this, rebel against the systems and plough through but he actually participates in it at times, and in some of the more complex dance aspects too, it also was quite impressive. If you consider the short against what has happened in Thom Yorke's life in the last few years, and the casting, it adds another, deeper, level of meaning to the film.

I can't pretend that this is the sort of thing that I'm really into, but in general terms I could appreciate the skill and effort that went into making it."
Anima,Great!,"I love both Thom Yorke's work as well as Paul Thomas Anderson's work so is it really any surprise I would love this? The previous music video work the two have done together were all pretty great, and it feels as if it all built up to this. Not in terms of this being the ultimate climax of their work together or something, but more that this 15 minute short musical film was incredibly well done and feels like Yorke and Anderson mixed both their fields of work together perfectly for each other. Great!"
Anima,ANIMA,"ANIMA is a short story film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and features Tom Yorke and his partner, actress Dajana Roncione. My interpretation of the short film represents how a collectivist society contrasts with individualism. Tom Yorke represents an individual who is trying to conform to a society he is not accustomed to. The symbolism for his individuality is represented by his briefcase in which followers of a collectivist society take away from him. Tom Yorke then tries to take his briefcase (individuality)back from them but the followers do not allow him to. Tom Yorke then sits alone in a whirlwind which can be represented as his frustration. He falls asleep but soon wakes up beside his love with calming music as they board a bus together. The conclusion for the film represents freedom and how there will always be support, understanding and encouragement for someone accustomed to individualism even if society tries to take it away from you."
Anima,PTA + Thom Yorke = An Audiovisual Feast!,"Although its exploration of the dystopian societies is nothing new, ANIMA is a fairly entertaining, and occasionally disturbing, hypnotic treat for the senses.

Anima,Striking Choreography; Not Much Else,"(Flash Review)

And this is coming from someone well-versed in Radiohead's music catalog as well as their music videos such as 7 Television Commercials and the Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time, which are both outstanding!!! This has some bold and striking choreography blended with the minimalistic sound reminiscent of the last Radiohead album and solo Yorke. Maybe because I couldn't comprehend the lyrics, I missed the core meaning but it was visually cool but without the depth or maybe I need to understand how to interpret dance."

Anima,Mesmerizing!!!!!,It's PTA and Thom Yorke. I mean what else could you possibly ask for??? Not to mention Prague.....
Anima,Visual & Auditive Trip,Thom Yorke's ANIMA and the directing of this film by Paul Thomas Anderson are quite a piece of art. 15 fantastic minutes.
Anima,Music and Motion,"Based on Thom Yorke's third solo album of the same name ""Anima"" is a collaboration between the Radiohead frontman and renowned director Paul Thomas Anderson. A 15 minute short on the drudgery of modern urban living ""Anima"" finds Yorke co-writing the soundtrack and in the lead role as a common man going through the tedium of day to day life. Using robotic synchronized choreography to depict life's mundanity Yorke and the rest of the cast bend, hop, slide and glide through the film rounding out in full circle life's course by finding themselves back where they came from at the end of the flick. I looked forward to seeing this film with some anticipation as it looked promising but was disappointed early in the film with the corny routines the actors made. I was expecting a darker, cooler and deeper film that would have complemented Yorke's best work. Instead I was witness to what looked like a backdrop to a Michael Jackson concert. That said despite the boring view it's good to see Yorke branching out in middle age and doing pretty well at it. For fans and the curious."
Anima,Lovely!,"There's a magnificent composition with a great sound engineering example, especially, I recommend to listen it with a good quality headphone. Furthermore, the chill atmosphere of Prague was represented good through a brilliant choreography, so there's a perfect harmony between place and actions. There are also so many metaphors which we can match/catch some of them from our daily lifes.

In brief, it'll able to get you down even in the opening scene. Congrats to whole of the crew. Trust me, this is a really really good stuff."
Anima,Completely meaningless but pushes the limits of visual music.,"This is just a fifteen minute music video, I found no purpose to it but it was very enjoyable and relaxing. The visuals are the clear selling point of it as it does look incredible. The music is great, obviously, its Thom Yorke were talking about. It was just a small break."
Anima,Favourite filmmaker and musician combine for a beautiful one-reeler,"PTA is my favourite filmmaker, and his work on Amina is absolutely on par with everything I've come to love and expect from him. Thom's music changed my life (without getting corny about it), and this album is hands down his best work. It's emotive, breathtaking art from two of the absolute best in their respective fields."
Anima,Thom Yorke looks so out of place,"I have to say I love Radiohead's music. The music in this short is as brilliant as ever, and Thom Yorke still manages to bring that particular melancholic mood out. However, I really thought Thom Yorke could have used a bit of image consultancy in this film. He looks so out of place among the beautiful dancers."
Anima,Meh...,"The first song is just great, Thom Yorke's solo career is superb since that astonishing soundtrack he made for Luca Guadagnino's Suspiria; the second song's not as good as the first one, but is still good.

I didn't liked the choreography that much, the lights and effects were ok, and PTA's part? just as the headline says: meh, this one-reeler could've been directed for M. Night Shyamalan and no one would've known the difference.

7/10"
Anima,Very nice!,"Both artists completed and complemented each other awesomely. Thom and Nigel's music, Paul's imagery, the choregraphies... it all blends into something unique. Congratulations!"
Anima,Boring,"Could have fininshed it in 5 minutes, but PTA decided to bore us to hell with it."
Anima,Apathima,"People often like to read too much into visual art, especially the abstract type. In order to say something smart and rare, people even end up seeing things that the original artist never intended, as it quietly assures them of access to a rare wavelength. Of course, artists too often deliberately create absurd art and leave it open to interpretation, allowing viewers to let their imaginations run crazy riots.

The work I am reviewing has been created by two highly talented individuals -- Radiohead's Thom Yorke, and film director, Paul Thomas Anderson. The work is a music video of a 3-piece compilation from Thom Yorke's solo album, Anima, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Both are remarkable artists in their own fields, and it is obvious that everyone would expect a superlative artwork every time they move a finger. Unfortunately, I didn't find that to be the case here. I don't see anything special. It's easy to tell that visuals have been filmed by a pro and are thus nice to look at, but they are neither mind-bending nor visceral, as has been claimed by drooling critics, almost all of whom fall into the category of people discussed in the first paragraph. Even the composition by Yorke is forgettable. All the sonic landscaping that this guy does with his band, Radiohead, is altogether missing here.

The entire visual imagery in the video is basically an attempt to depict, by the way of dance moves, the dreary existence most urban dwellers endure, marred by cutthroat competition for materials around them and cloying moralities that turn into regrets when it's too late in life. At least that's what I understood. It's a shame that both gentlemen picked such a beaten-up theme and put out a mediocre product.

Actually, flogging a piece of art is not fair, because art is neither good or bad, nor logical or methodical. Art is what each person perceives it to be. However, this is my attempt to explain the basis for my disliking.

I am a huge fan of both Yorke/Radiohead and PTA, but I refuse to be compelled to like this just because popular names are associated with it. It is just a one-time watch thing. One-time watch, only to see what the bloody brouhaha is all about. It is neither boring nor radically innovative, but just watchable...

...and forgettable."
Anima,Anima is a daydream that poetically reflects our dreadful life,"How many of us haven't caught ourselves daydreaming while chasing our dreams in our daily busy life in the big cities? And when we look around and we can see that everyone else seems to be trapped in the same reality of chasing money to seek happiness. My interpretation of this video is that Thom Yorke is talking to us about how life passes through our eyes everyday, while we live in a fantasy and struggle to find a meaning to it all, being it a true love or anything else, and it all ends in the same circle, tomorrow the meaning hunting repeats all over again. And he says ""I'm not running - Enough of broken glass"" and continues ""But you're free - Show me the money - Party with a rich zombie"" and finalized with ""If you could do it all again... I think I missed something, But I'm not sure what"". And that's is a painful and poetic interpretation of this thing called life."

You vs. Wild,I think people are missing the point...,"The very fact this appears under 'Children' on most online entertainment platforms probably says it all... it's rated PG for a reason...

If you watch this and think it a serious documentary/off the cuff survival then I'm sorry but you may need to take yourself off to see if you can survive for 24hrs in the snow covered Swiss Mountains.

The whole thing is staged, in order to teach CHILDREN a little bit about survival whilst keeping it interesting. It's not a live show where Grylls will do what you tell him - it's pre-recorded with different outcomes ergo it has to be staged.

I'm literally flabbergasted by some of the negative reviews stating 'oh it's fake, the camera was just in the right spot when he dropped his machete' etc etc.

My four year old loves this, and whilst there are the odd things you probably wouldn't do in real life or Grylls isn't dressed quite right for the weather what does it really matter?

Genuinely people need to chill out a little."
You vs. Wild,Good Fun,I played? It twice just to see how much trouble I could get Bear in...
You vs. Wild,If you like Man Vs Wild you'll love this,"Just like the infamous Man vs Wild show but now interactive with you as the navigator. They started doing this type of interactive show with the Black Mirror people and now it is with Bear Grylls . It's very cool and a lot of fun. If you pick wrong you have to go back and pick correct. It's nothing amazing, but I'll admit it's pretty fun. The episodes are only about 15-20 minutes each and there is always a scenario that you must finish. 8/10 . I enjoyed it a lot being a big fan of Bear."
You vs. Wild,Just pure joy and adventure,You just can't dislike this interactive show which has bear grylls in it. The show is just like Man Vs wild but it involves you to take the decision for bear and it's always a fun to put him in difficult situation. The best part of the show is you can watch the whole episode with multiple perspectives.
You vs. Wild,"Fun, but many choices are misleading and lacking information",Comentario no disponible
You vs. Wild,This is what kids need,Interaction. Choices. Consequences. I am suggesting all kids and young adults see this. I personally loved it.
You vs. Wild,Could've been great,"First of all, it's fun for my son who is 6. He thinks it's cool and it beats watching bluey or spongebob again. However, they could have made it great for adults too but missed the mark. Everything is way too staged. I understand that these types of shows have to be to an extent. But things like human hand bones and a fake wreckage is pushing it. It makes it fall short on realism and real choices. I'm honestly not sure what I would want differently on the choices themselves. I'm torn between him giving more information. Or just saying here's the choices with no info and just seeing what we'd pick with no influence. Overall, main complaint is the realism of the scenarios."
You vs. Wild,My kids & I loved it!,"This is such a great idea. My girls love reading those puzzle books so when I saw this show I thought we would give it a go. They loved the interaction and I thought it was done really well. Yes it's obviously scripted, but that doesn't take away from the enjoyment of it. I even made some choices that didn't end well, which my girls thought was very amusing.

It's different, it's interesting, and the kids loved it, what more could you want?!"
You vs. Wild,Good idea,"This is a really fun and unique idea! But the execution just wasn't spot on, Bear was very suggestive when he was asking what the viewer thinks he should do. For example, ""should I jump off a cliff and probably die but get where I'm going faster, or take the slow route through the jungle with lots of bugs but live"". He suggests one extreme and unnecessary measure with one simple and obvious one.

I was actually purposely doing the wrong answer just to see what would happen.

I think if he can make this show a little more challenging and thought provoking then he has my vote! I love the idea of this."
You vs. Wild,AMAZING idea. Terrible execution.,Bear has no level of common sense and it's a little too scripted for the sake of getting the viewer to go a certain path. Very confusing camera work and shots with next to no continuity sometimes and it's just a little difficult to tolerate.
You vs. Wild,Great family TV. The kids will love it!,"It's a lot of fun with survival learning and healthy debate across young and old about which survival choice to make. Yes he is not really in a life or death danger and that's because he is filming a tv show. Yes it's staged but who cares? It's interactive, it's educational and it's good entertainment that involves family discussion and debate. Good job Bear."
You vs. Wild,"Interesting idea, but not that gripping","Just saw this in my Netflix suggestions and thought I'd give it a go. It's a very fun concept, of course, and it's great to see something like this getting made. I was entertained and giggled a couple of times. It's definitely amusing trying to figure out not only what's going to happen, but also what the show wants to tell you is the best way to go. Sadly, most decisions could be both good and bad, and the outcome is ultimately a bit random. Of course, every situation is an opportunity to learn a useful tidbit, so that's nice. I guess my main gripe is that there's too much hand holding. Almost every time we have to choose, BG says we're in charge, etc. etc. etc. I get it! Also, every time that choice is made, BG repeats what we just picked. Overall, there's a lot of time getting wasted in all sorts of ways. Plus, let's be honest - BG doesn't need to work that hard to make a living at this point, , and it seems obvious that any moment that doesn't show his face is likely done by a team of other people. In the end, it's just not 'thrilling' - I guess that's the best way to put it. It's entertaining, somewhat educational, and encouraging as part of Netflix's experiments. It's also great that you CAN actually 'fail' the missions. But the guy isn't ever in real peril. I think that, as a kid, I would've absolutely adored it. I would have gone back to try different scenarios. As it is, for me, it's going to be soon forgotten."
You vs. Wild,Perfect for kids,"I've finished this interactive series around 2 weeks ago and I just think that it is perfect for kids that love the outdoors, especially for those curious about everything and eager to learn new things. If you're an adult, though, you can still find it somewhat enjoyable - mostly if you are a Bear Grylls fan, like I am."
You vs. Wild,Great concept; poor execution. A wasted opportunity!,"The idea of a survivalist show where you make the choices is brilliant! I was excited to take part, explore options, and put my own knowledge to the test. However, I feel they've missed the mark with the final product. The options are often too vague, or indifferent, with consequences of your actions not really being clear. The show would greatly benefit from taking a bit more time to explain the reasoning/outcome for each choice. If they'd done that, it would not only be entertaining, but also far more educational. Instead, it's all a bit sensationalised now.

Which leads me onto my only other gripe with the show. There's too much staged drama, not enough survivalist work. Someone like Bear doesn't need stunt doubles, so why they do unnecessary dramatic intros is bewildering. I appreciate staging a survival scenario for the sake of demonstration purposes, but adding in unnecessary props, is taking it too far and spoils the show. It sends a clear message that the producers were more interested in making it dramatic, to engage the audience, rather than letting the exploration and discovery learning do it for them.

Wasted opportunity, but hopefully one they can learn from. Get a better producer on board for the next season, and let the interactivity and discovery be the draw card, rather than silly dramatic scenes done by stunt doubles."
You vs. Wild,Ideal for kids but lacking comprehensive learning material,"The whole concept of making choices is neat and would be good for entertaining kids.

That said, one issue I have with the presentation of choices is that Bear doesn't really explain the pros and cons of each choice. Plus he sometimes leaves out critical information and you only learn it after you make the wrong choice.

One example is when you are given a choice to go through mangroves or razor sharp vegetation. It would seem a no-brainer to pick mangroves because that's better than getting stitches. However, the mangroves ends up in a failure. So I started over and choice the razor sharp vegetation. This time Bear reveals a secret trick for getting through the vegetation without getting cut up. Why didn't he say anything about that trick? I would've chosen the razor sharp vegetation in the first place.

Another problem, which is not a big deal, is that it obviously is scripted but they pretend it's all live. One way I can tell is they somehow get perfect camera angles for ""unexpected"" events like dropping a machete. You would only get that kind of footage if you knew ahead of time it was going to happen.

Despite the above issues it is good for entertaining and educating kids."
You vs. Wild,Love It!,"I always wondered how I'd be like in the wild, and this show is the closest to living that out. I wish Bear Grylls didn't narrate the way he did - he sounds like freakin' Dora-The-Explorer - and sometimes, the choices are a bit ridiculous. Oh, I can't complain though... This show's great for those who love adventure."
You vs. Wild,Great idea,"Ever since i was a young boy and had that book ""if you want to go this way please continue reading on page xy"" i wondered why nobody seemed to take over this idea to the 21st century

I couldn't stop watching this and had to try out each and every possible way"
You vs. Wild,A very cool concept,"This is the second version of interactive film that I have watched on Netflix. This was done way better than Bandersnatch. Bander-snatch was a bore to watch but still was okay, however this show just flew by with its cool concept. I loved trying to murder this guy through the tv screen by touching a remote. I was not disappointed and I did not fail either. I see this could be the start of a new wave of television."
You vs. Wild,I like,"Look like game i like The team is very attentive to details. And Bear has done very well

From Thailand"
You vs. Wild,Just found and like this show!,"I just found this show while I was snooping around Netflix. It is a bit different because of the interactive element. Basically you get to choose which scenario Bear does. It is a bit corny, but I do think it is interesting to see what outcomes the different choices produce. Of course, it is staged, but how could it not be, if they are supposed to film the outcomes of two different choices. I think that the educational value of the interactive feature is completely worth it. The other thing that is cool about this show is that it is very different and unique. As far as I know, there are no other shows like it on TV."
You vs. Wild,Too Staged,"I was a fan of Man Vs. Wild, but this one was too much. In the original show, I was ok with the fact that situations were presented to Bear to teach skills. However, in this show, the quick camera cuts make it clear that he either 1. Only did half the task, or 2. Didn't actually do it at all."
You vs. Wild,Amazing concept and challenging work!!!,Amazing work and very interesting. I havent seen anything like this before ever. Very skillful tasks. I cant feel my surrounding when i watch this. This is what i call a show that one can give unlimited time towards. Please keep it up for a specific audience.
You vs. Wild,At least make it realistic,"How fake could a show get? Good concept, but at least make an effort to make it seem real. Camera angles and decisions give everything away. I wouldnt be surprised if the animals were tamed as well. What a joke...haha."
You vs. Wild,this is great,"Watching this man walking in the difficult terrain and making choices for him, is something hard and i felt pressure about his safety, even though i know in my back of mind that he gonna be fine. its a great show, now doubt about it. whole childhood passed watching on discovery and other channels but when you try to control him in the jungle is something worth watching and involving. Netflix done a great job here by creating such interactive shows, in which the audience get involved and immersed fully, carefully taking decisions is another point. love this show like i did with bandersnatch but its different than that. here everything is real and in open and not in controlled environment, which makes it more exciting than bandersnatch. loved this show."
You vs. Wild,Excellent way to teach unprepared people not to be dumb,"This is an awesome idea. Because ""you never know"", today you may be lying on your couch eating doritos while watching Netflix in pyjamas, one day you could be unwillingly trapped in an undesired wild situation.

Comments who say ""this is half staged"", ""not realistic enough"" etc should understand it's not entertainment, but simple small bits of general education. Don't eat this, don't try that, think about xxx and yyy, that's the point of the show. Not to see Bear put his life at risk a 32893892th time.

As many wrote it before it's a must see for kids aswell, because the interactive trial&error also teaches to not rush everything, think about your environment, and plan ahead.

Love it, good job Netflix, good job Bear."

Ready to Mingle,The main character is horrible,"I found the main character to be absolutely horrible and self centred. This is not a feel good love story, this is a spoilt brat who has no clue about the lives of those around her."
Ready to Mingle,I watched over an hour and couldn't keep going,"After I stopped, I read all the reviews to see if I should keep going, and so some of my comments are prompted by those.

I apologise for not finishing the movie and still writing a review. I know that's not really fair, but I just couldn't take it anymore and when I read the reviews it seems my problem with the movie wasn't going to go away. I would have persevered if the reviews had been different. Especially as my bar for watching was pretty low since I'm practicing my Spanish comprehension and am watching anything halfway decent as an educational exercise.

I don't think I had an issue with the main character and her cohort being marriage-obsessed. I get that some women are, regardless of the culture they're from. I get that some cultures are very marriage-obsessed and the pressure on any woman after she turns 20 or 21 to get married before she becomes unmarriageable and worthless is real. I wasn't conscious that this was an impediment to my enjoyment of the movie. I enjoy a lot of movies from cultures that aren't mine, with viewpoints that aren't mine.

Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the acting was good - very good. The main actor, Cassandra Ciangherotti, did a great job portraying a very real character. She has an element of Kristen Wiig about her - awkward, funny, very mobile and expressive face. She was completely believable as Ana. I'm going to see what else she's in.

The problem was that I hated Ana. I would have found her selfish, fake, narcissistic, unpleasant, and immature had she been 13 years old. For a character who is supposedly in her late 20s, she's unbearable. She's awful to family, friends, everyone -- and refuses to see it. I thought this movie would be about how the shock of a breakup caused real introspection and growth, but 1 hour and 6 minutes into it I saw no evidence this was happening.

Instead of becoming a better and more mature human being, she just kept getting worse. Ana was so bad that the relationship with the good guy she meets is entirely unbelievable - why on earth does he fall in love with her? What can they possibly talk about? They have nothing in common. What does she have to offer any intelligent, adult man (or anyone)? There is nothing to Ana except her self-absorption and obsession with doing anything it takes to get married.

TL;DR - The main character (not the actress) is an awful human being and I feel like her awfulness was cross-cultural."

Ready to Mingle,Hard to watch!,"Even though there were entertaining scenes, it was super hard to watch most of the time. The main actress is not like able at all, she is super awkward, needy, annoying and childish, plus painfully selfish... whichled her to make a very cruel decision, just to get what she wanted. The supporting actresses were way more interesting and funny. It's a shame because the main idea was promising... Good actors, location, but they didn't know how to deliver it (in my opinion of course). Also, the end sucked, after having watched the entire film just to at least find out how everything was going to turn out, they don't show us much and ends without much warning...

I am actually frustrated with this movie. Won't be recommending this."
Ready to Mingle,Mildly entertaining,Comentario no disponible
Ready to Mingle,Don't waste your time,"This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen. Poorly directed, poorly produced, the argument is lame and the acting is awful. I forced myself to watch it until the end just to see if it would get any better, but and the end was like ""really!?!?"""
Ready to Mingle,A movie about nothing,"This is the kind of films that portrays that women can only have one goal in life: getting married. The plot is absolutely mediocre. There are no plot twists nor entertaining story telling. The humor is not smart at all. If you decide to waste your time watching this, prepare to yourself to watch the worst acting in the recent mexican film industry. Thinking about the amount of wasted money in this makes me feel so bad."
Ready to Mingle,Super Película para Chicas!,"THIS MOVIE MADE ME SHOUT OUT LOUD, DANCE, SCREAM IN FRUSTRATION, AND AT THE END I WAS SINGING ALONG WITH THE WOMEN, THE GREAT LYRICS TO ""A QUIÉN LE IMPORTA""!!! Honestly, I don't understand why there's such a low average rating. Maybe it has to do with the cultural barrier that's built in to this type of movie. As someone who is ""MexicoAmericana"", (like the song by La Santa Cecilia), I completely get the movie. Whenever I was in Mexico, whether for school or to visit, the only important thing appeared to be the possibility of my marriage. This movie hits all the pressure points that a woman faces. Especially in a culture where at 30 you are considered left on shelf. Watch it, and you can enjoy it beyond expectations, if you remember that not every culture is American."
Ready to Mingle,Unwatchable,"I was actually kind of looking forward to this, but after watching the first 10 minutes I found that the words don't even match their mouths. How did this get passed through Netflix. Absolutely awful."
Ready to Mingle,Why are coming of age movies for women treated so poorly?,This is a charming coming of age movie with a perfect ending. Loved it!
Ready to Mingle,Good One Netflix,"Good movie, with good actors and story. I was totally entertained and found this to be a pleasant diversion on a Wednesday night. Latino actors are very accomplished and know how to project well. Loved them all."
Ready to Mingle,"Pretty good , end could have been better",Comentario no disponible
Ready to Mingle,Quite funny. Don't believe the low ratings from the woke crowd.,"Hmm...Seems to be getting a bit of a bashing for nonsense like being dubbed, or the character has the wrong name, is unappealing etc...1 star seriously? Well I smell BS!!

The nonsense 'woke' idea is that a woman in the modern world is now = to a man. To portray otherwise means vicious 1 star ratings and reviews online!

The hate and nonsense low ratings for for this movie is without a doubt from the woke crowd. A few of them must have a meme going on twitter, effective where there are only a few reviews like this movie presently, to snuff out these 'anti-feminist' movies of women facing the reality of finding a mate in time and even worse scheme to marry them!

Don't let them put you off!! This is a genuinely funny, warm and touching movie.It honestly got me laughing every few minutes and its been quite a while since a movie did that!

This is almost like a female version of 'School for Scoundrels' (1960) but funnier and more modern! I didn't think anything like this could come from Mexico! Loved it!"

Sin Filtro,Really Enjoyed It,"Shrinking was just as good as I had hoped for. First of all, as soon as I saw Harrison Ford and Jason Segal were starring in it I was already going to watch it but then after reading all the positive reviews and watching the trailer my excitement grew even more. Well, I just finished it and it not only met my expectations but surpassed them. I'm not saying it's the best show of the year but it's an original, feel good comedy that will make you laugh throughout each episode. I'd definitely recommend this but make sure you give yourself enough time to watch it because you're going to want to binge it as quickly as you can."
Sin Filtro,Already looking forward to next season,I actually really enjoyed Shrinking. It's about a grieving therapist (Jason Segal) who has enough and starts telling his patients exactly what he really thinks of them. What follows is a really funny series that will make you laugh out loud. The best part of the show are the interactions between Segal's character and Harrison Ford's character. This show has gotten nothing but great reviews for a reason. This show will no doubt be nominated for all kind of awards and deservingly so. It must be doing well because it's already gotten an early renewal for a second season. I can't wait to see more of this!
Sin Filtro,I want more Jessica Williams!,"And the rest of the show is great, too. Jason Segel is perfectly cast for this script. He has the weird, idiotically confident energy needed for this role. And Jessica is perfect. Her humor is just right for the dialogue. This is the new way of situation dramedies. No real punch lines, just engaging personalities with a pinch of quirk, and family circumstances that are just a little over the line from normal, but still relatable. Of course, Jimmy's behavior as a therapist is completely absurd. You would lose your license immediately. Just impossible. But we allow metaphorical situations in drama. And in this script, we sense a strong purposefulness in the decisions. We have to give the writers the benefit and try to get the gist. For me, it's easy and fun. Other reviewers, apparently, struggled."
Sin Filtro,Harrison Ford needs to do more comedy!,"Harrison Ford is simply amazing in this show! His dry delivery is the absolute best. His curmudgeon demeanor and sharp tongue is now my life goal when I reach my elder years. He's hysterical and I need more of this in my life!!! Also, if you're a fan of Jason Segel, you will not be disappointed.

This show is so beautifully written. It has well-rounded characters dealing with real issues. It brings all the feels and leaves you wanting more each week. In the vein of Ted Lasso, it feels like a warm hug. I cannot wait for season 2! Anyway, watch this show. You will be so happily surprised and glad you took the journey."
Sin Filtro,Wasnt Expecting This To Be This Good,"Two episodes out currently and this show exhibits a lot of promise, the chemistry between characters is infectious and even oddly so at times... its heartwarming in ways that most shows aren't, reminding solely of the show Community for these elements. I'm not sure if this accurately displays a therapist's way of coping with issues but it sure does allow room for Jason Segel to put his own spin on it. Harrison Ford plays Dr Rhodes, Jason's boss and mentor of sorts.. I wasn't sure how his character was going to work in this show but the antisocial likeness of Rhodes sure does play into a persona that Ford meets quite well when thinking about the more apprehensive elements of his character Han Solo in Star Wars, it just fits like a glove in this show. Somehow all too relatable, Sean (Luke Tennie) plays somewhat of a son figure to Jimmy (Segel) while he deals with familial issues of his own with his daughter Alice (Lukita Maxwell)... What I see here feels so vivid and the possibilities maybe (?) endless as I see Jimmy navigate these things. Btw, the intro theme to this show is so good, I didnt even skip it when watching the 2nd episode... And the music in this show is so good. Overall this is turning out to be a wonderful show and I hope it only keeps getting better from here."
Sin Filtro,Go watch it RIGHT NOW!!,"This show slaps!! The characters have a lot of growth even in the first and second episode, the jokes are perfectly timed and executed, and all of the actors are doing a superb job! This is one of the best piolet episodes I've seen in quite a while! Harrison Ford does an amazing job in his supporting role and Jason Segal does a wonderful job playing a flawed, damaged character that is trying to be a better person and father. This is one of the best shows I have seen in a while! This show made me laugh like I haven't in a long time. As a psychology student this show is hilarious, and as a theatre student I can appreciate how great the script flows. I cannot understand the negative reviews as this is already one of my favorite shows after only two episodes. I hope the rest is as good!!"
Sin Filtro,it is helping me a lot handle my own anxiety and pain,"I have just been through a bad breakup where i wanted to end my life it was so impactful and unxepected for me. But looking at the first two episodes already made me think positively about life and about my own problems. All episodes are funny and taking mental problems with a small twist and fun. It shows weaknesses of people and tries to focus on the joyful side of life, and the way to move on from the pain. Which is exactly what i want. I dont want people telling me to move on, but having the pain of moving on. I need to focus on something else, on joy on happines and fun, and with that slowly moving past the pain, or at least covering up the pain. So yes, I am eagerly looking forward to the new episodes. Thank you!"
Sin Filtro,Comedy gold,"This is fun pure and simple. Crisply written, great one liners, enough pathos to prevent it becoming Big Bang Theory for the middle classes, a joy to watch. Yes real therapists wouldn't behave like this but anyone with a functioning brain cell would know that so criticism from that perspective is just negativity for the sake of dragging the rating down. Are some of the characters stereotypes? Yes, but no offence is given and none should be taken, FYI, I worked with a gay guy who was exactly the stereotype shown here. The real success here is blending the seriousness of therapy and grief with the growing pains of life at different ages, stages and ways of life and making it dammed funny. Finally, who knew what a fine light comedy actor Harrison Ford is? A complete revelation and worth watching the show just for him."
Sin Filtro,Downhill slope,"Show started out interesting with substance; however, it really swiftly became tedious, monotonous, and less interesting. It's more difficult with each episode to stay invested in the characters, story line, character development and honestly are these people believable. There are a few that are relatable, but so few that in between it's hard to stay invested. I expected a lot more from the the strong intro episodes and then it just floundered into the abyss. My attention is waning as fast as the relevance of the plot and characters. It's disappointing because the cast is capable of so much more. Grow these characters up. Not everyone stays in adolescence forever so give some of them some maturity."
Sin Filtro,I'm loving it so far.,"I think the storylines are great. I can't wait to see who all we get to meet!! I'll be happy to see where these go. And as they flesh these out I see myself getting more invested. It didn't take me long at all to care about what happens to awoke of these characters. Has a great cast! I've laughed but I'm sure this will be sad at some point. Even if it's a sweet sad ya know. I'll tune in every week ready to see what happens. Minds wish I could binge it though, like that's how much I'm into it. I wasn't sure Jason Segel was the right choice when I wanted the previews. I was wrong, he's won me over in two episodes. Excited to see what it goes."

Sin Filtro,"I love Liz, I wish this show could go on forever with more seasons and episodes.","I absolutely love Liz's character; I wish I could be friends with her in real life. I love stones too, and I collect them for myself :)

Episode 11 broke me alongside Jimmy's breakdown, but it allowed me to emotionally release a lot, which was really good for me.

I wish this series, like Friends, could last for decades because it's the only thing that helps me feel better during these days of depression and grief that I'm going through.

I really wish Season 3 would come out this year, and I wish this show could go on forever with more seasons and episodes. I honestly can't wait for the next season, and I'm already sad about the time I have to spend away from the amazing Shrinking characters."
Sin Filtro,Not silly like other Apple TV+ offerings.,"I've watched the first two episodes and I find them compelling. Part of the reason is that I found there was something reality based off a therapist who needs therapy and wants to break through to his patients to unexpectedly break through his own issues.

I also respect the way it is presented - he is not doing something that other therapists should do, and that is quite clear.

It hasn't gotten into the silly situations of other shows like Loot, but it's still early in the series and I'll continue watching it.

The show isn't for everyone. That being said, I enjoy the depth of the characters that don't seem like caricatures; they are people who I am interested in getting to know."
Sin Filtro,Solid engaging and worth it!,"This was a solid production and very unique storyline. The acting was terrific. I love how each character embraces their imperfections and shows vulnerability and employs humor to make spiritual growth.

Shrinking has a ton of heartfelt moments, awkward moments, mildly funny cute moments and laugh out loud moments. I hope they continue to make additional seasons of this because the character development warrants it.

Is it perfect? No. But neither are any of us. I think the overuse of profanity takes away from the overall power potential here. It's almost like the writers are forcefully making the show edgy. I personally don't think it needed it. That's why I gave it an 8. Definitely worth watching it."
Sin Filtro,Really enjoying this,"From the reviews I'm reading here, people either seem to love this show or dislike it pretty intensely, and it feels like it might depend on the reviewers reaction to Jason Segal. I've enjoyed his movies and I think he's perfect for this role -- and the addition of Harrison Ford takes the show to an even higher level.

The writing is excellent, the story is fresh and the characters are original without going over the top into stereotypically too quirky. The relationships are complex and emotional, and very real human challenges are well-drawn. It can be laugh-out-loud funny and in the next minute bring on tears.

I was truly disappointed after the second episode when I realized I would have to wait for more. Highly recommend!"
Sin Filtro,Really Enjoying it,"I was actually shocked by all the boo hooing going on here. My husband and I are really enjoying each episode. People complaining about jokes falling flat are probably not watching the same show. I'm actually very impressed by the entire cast, very rarely do you get so many actors that can really feed off each other and make one five minute scene feel like two minutes. For example, the scene where Sean is looking through the trash. There's so much chunk on TV and not much is worth the time to invest but Shrinking is actually a good one to watch and I would be shocked if you truly were disappointed."
Sin Filtro,Best show in a LONG time,"It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a new show this much. I've tried many, but they all have missed the mark, and lots are down right terrible. This show fires on all cylinders. It is a well written story, about intelligent people, and every actor in it just nails their part. I eagerly look forward to every new episode. For this to happen, I need characters that I care about. Amazingly, Shrinking has managed to make me care about every single one of them. The dialogue is spectacular. I especially like the scenes with Harrison Ford's character having chats with the daughter of Jason Segel's character. Thanks for all involved in bringing this terrific show to my TV screen."
Sin Filtro,First Episode great.....then it kinda got worse from there on in,"Initially, I was really looking forward to this and the first episode was pretty damn good. Little did I know, this was the best it was ever going to get.

As I write this review, I am watching E8. All I can say is everything rapidly went pear shaped. It seems to have the unfortunate ability to constantly telegraph what will happen well in Advance.

As a result, it can appear lazy in it's execution, on top of that the near Constant use of the F word starts to grate, and shows the weakness of the script.

It's occasionally witty, and Harrison Ford as Paul is fine. I hope it Improves for the 2 nd series."
Sin Filtro,Beautifully Complicated: A Show That Gets What It Means to Be Human,"Shrinking is a rare gem-a show that's as funny as it is deeply moving. It's a smart, heartfelt exploration of grief, growth, and the messy ways people try to fix themselves and each other. Jason Segel is fantastic as a therapist who's spiraling after a personal loss, and Harrison Ford brings unexpected warmth and depth to his role as his gruff, no-nonsense mentor.

What makes Shrinking so special is how it balances sharp humor with moments that hit you right in the gut. It's honest, emotional, and incredibly human-a show that understands just how complicated and beautiful life can be.

It is absolutely brilliant."
Sin Filtro,"Interesting, but not quite","The first couple of episodes were very interesting. They had a good premise and had potential and some ""soul"".

The acting in general is quite good, having this amazing mix of veterans as well as a few newcomers, and the chemistry seems to work well.

However, now getting to the critical part, the show runs out of steam quite quickly. The number of shows talking about psychiatrists and therapy seem to be exponentially increasing - its been done a lot since the 80s-90s.

And then the characters. It must be nice to live in a place where everyone knows everyone else, Neighbors, colleagues, patients, childhood friends, Everyone seems to be genuine, thoughtful, involved, and has some history with everyone else. Oh, and everyone is a well-educated doctor, or lawyer, happy to offer advice on a whim. Even the nurse is wealthy. Must be nice."
Sin Filtro,Extremely touching and funny at the same time,"The show gets you in the feels while laughing the entire way through. The cast is amazing and you grow attached to each character early on. The lessons on life are amazing and really sell the show as one of the best dramedies in the past decade. The show goes over a lot of dark themes with humour in a way that I've never seen in a show before.

Just finished season two and I thought it wouldn't be able to compare but I think season two was even better without having to just rely on the character dynamics. I think the plot lines were intricate and fleshed out. The story also doesn't just rely on Jimmy spiralling and getting better which is what a lot of shows end up doing when they get renewed."
Sin Filtro,Funny & Warm,"Great writing, I love the characters, we need more of this; lite, but so real and who cannot relate to this ? I look forward to seeing more...... Harrison is phenomenal as always, looking good Harrison.

I feel like every character portrayed exactly how the comedy intended from the beginning, life should be something one can find some humor in or you might be inclined to be more on the grumpy side of the population.

Real life situations but turning these not so desirable circumstances into something everyone can see themselves and find something positive or at least an opportunity to make some changes.

We only get one life, I choose humor ."
Sin Filtro,Top notch series,"I like many shows but it is rare that one can hit me in the heart as much as this one. The layers and ups and downs is so relatable at its core, especially for people that have struggled in life or have seen people struggle. Incredible writing and I wish more series could break the barriers like this did. You don't just feel like you are watching the show but as the series goes on you feel part of the little unit and by the end you feel like you are sat with them and see how much they have all grown. The messages I took from the series was very potent and it was to always look beyond your own problems but not ignore them and help others in need especially if you don't know their circumstances."
Sin Filtro,Brilliant in every way,"Brilliant in every way. This show had me and my partner laughing right the way through. What surprised us is that it did it with a well throught out, but simple story. The characters were all lovable and had their own qwerks and the humour felt natural and not forced. It really did leave us wanting more so we're both looking forward to season 2!

The only thing I would have liked to see more would be more time in the practice as some of the characters were not fully utilised in each episode.

Harrison Ford stole the show though, his blunt old man routine is an instant winner everytime. But he never overshadowed the other cast."
Sin Filtro,Season 1 is amazing and Season 2 is better!!!,"I rarely leave reviews...not sure why but I felt compelled to leave a review for Shrinking. I was pretty bummed when Ted Lasso ended and luckily I stumbled upon Shrinking. The episodes suck you in, they are so well written and the acting is amazing! It's great seeing Harrison Ford again...such a solid choice for this role. All the actors make this show incredibly special. They will make you feel anger, empathy, sadness, compassion, and joy. I found myself smiling, laughing A LOT, and even tearing up.

I just finished season 2...wow!!! I thought the first season was incredible and couldn't be topped but they did it. Season 2 is better. Do yourself a favor and watch this show, so worth your time."

Awe!,negative reviews are based on politics not the movie,"All actors put effort in this, it also gives a kind message to investigate before making a statement dont listen to the negative reviews, no doubt they express their political views and the proof of that lies with in it negative reviews give this movie 1 star, 1 star? even the last jedi got 7 stars, this is not fair obviously u have time? then this worths that time not saying this movie is a must watch just saying it definetly worths the while"
Awe!,Very worthwhile story - execution could have been better,Despite the A list cast and very worthy subject matter this movie about the WMD deception feels a little amateurish. There are pros and cons of the way the issues are stated clearly in more or less in sequence. The pros are you get it. The points aren't lost or mumbled so as to be missed. And there is not jigsaw puzzle narrative. That is good. Unlike Spotlight which was a bit confusing. The cons are it feels like a lecture / documentary. The best point is it puts together and illuminates the sequence of events and the WMD deception from it's early stages to the invasion and the consequences. The most eye opening thing is that these journalists were on to the deception from such an early stage and the main stream press refused to let the public know.
Awe!,Negative reviews are evidence of disconnect from reality,This was a well done movie which succeeded in angering me all over again how this criminal administration lied America into an illegal and immoral war aided and abetted by the main stream media and supported by a gullible populace who hates to admit that they were wrong.
Awe!,Much better than the reviews here might lead you to believe,Shock and Awe is a pretty good movie. Don't let the partisan sniping dissuade you from taking it in. It's worth it. Recommended.
Awe!,The truth is out there,"The real life story behind what became one of the worst war mistakes a US president made. And all that just to retaliate and try to find peace. The movie has quite the strong story to dig into. That alone and how some reporters where fighting for the truth to come out is amazing enough. When everyone else was going along the line of what the president said ... they didn't.

And having the right actors to pull that off helps too. Still the absolute zinger seems to be missing. This is more than good and decent, don't get me wrong, but for those familiar with what happened and how this played out, this may feel a bit weak. Or not as strong as it could have been. Great acting overall though and the story might take you to a hopeful place. Because no matter how many times, the hopefully one term president screams and yells about the press being the enemy of the people, it just ain't true"
Awe!,Very Popular in rural Iowa,"We had a good turn out at our little community theater in Fairfield, IA. Would screen again."
Awe!,important but flat rehashing,"This follows a group of reporters at Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau from 9/11 to the Iraq War and a young man named Adam Green who was inspired by 9/11 to join the military. John Walcott (Rob Reiner) is the bureau chief. Jonathan Landay (Woody Harrelson) and Warren Strobel (James Marsden) are his best reporters. Almost immediately, they find various political players pushing Iraq as the culprit of 9/11. They are joined by veteran reporter Joe Galloway (Tommy Lee Jones).

Knight Ridder's truthful reporting is an important aspect of the Iraq war buildup. The question is how to tell the well-worn story in a dramatic fashion. The movie inserts the Green family which is fine and gets one great scene with the mother asking the son to point to Afghanistan. I was more dubious about inserting a dating story which does add an interesting dad confrontation. The movie needs a villain and it sets its sights on the administration. That's fair but it's not dramatic. Nothing is new. They even use old news footage. It only re-enforces the flat, old rehashing of old news that this movie needs to avoid. There are a couple of good scenes with their publishing partners which could be the real villains. It needs to concentrate on that much more and it needs Judith Miller. She would be a perfect foil for this group and could provide some juicy controversy. They should work harder to take down the New York Times. That's the drama with the Times getting all the headlines and Knight Ridder getting the truth."
Awe!,Lets tick some boxes,"Very interesting subject matter, good cast. Lets tick some boxes to cover all the bases with a short side glance to some character back stories. Turned into a very shallow film, more of a low budget crowd pleaser than a quality film"
Awe!,I saw the image of my country in the mirror.,"First of all, allow me to apologize for any grammar mistake in my comment.

Second, I'm from Romania (Eastern Europe) where our situation in the country is very alike the idea of the movie. Our government is making so many mistakes, trying effortlessly to justify them by social media, TV channels or any kind of press release that they have direct interest to influence peoples opinions. I was touched at the end of the movie when they presented the actual facts.

I was delighted by the actors performances. I kindly recommend you to watch this masterpiece, hoping you'll understand what real journalism is all about: searching and publishing the truth!"
Awe!,Good investigative reporting doesn't always get it justice!,"Investigative reporting, until the advent of the Trump administration, has had a bad odor since Bush's invasion of Iraq. Rob Reiner's 'Shock and Awe', based on a true story, has given it new life, and is an antidote to Trump's shouting at the drop of a hat 'fake news' or the psycho babble Rupert Murdoch's Fox News serves up daily as distortions of truth and dollops of propaganda. If you're looking for the glamor and excitement of 'All the President's Men', you won't find it here. What, however, you'll find is the shoe and leather craft of investigative reporting, and why hard facts and the truth matter. 9/11 fed the hungry mouth of blind nationalism; it colored reporting, as well as it stoked the flames of revenge. Bush went to war in Afghanistan to avenge 9/11, to quash Al Qaeda and capture and kill Osama ben Laden. But he and his vice president Cheney and close advisors had another war on their mind, a war in Iraq to topple a tooth dictator Saddam Hussein and bring the fruits of US democracy to Iraqi. Rob Reiner has made a solid film of how the main stream media fell for the propaganda Bush & co fed the press and TV news. And yet, one news outlet Knight Ridder News Service didn't. And Reiner's script writer Joey Hartstone tells it as it was, cleverly andwith strong feeling and with a pen planted in reality. The film opens on two planes: John Landry (Woody Harrelson) partakes in a war game for journalists and what they should do if captured by terrorists; this before 9/11...as though it were game of Cowboys and Indians. The real drama begins of Willie Lewis (a strong Luke Tennie), a paraplegic, owing to an IED in Iraq, who wheels himself into a Congressional hearing on the Iraq War; he begins by fingering beads of data on the war to the Congressmen here assembled who look at him benignly, as a young man who signed up after 9/11 to serve his country, and then turns the tables on them and asks 'how did this happen?'And then we get into the quick of the story. Two persistent reporters Landry and Warren Strobel (James Marsden) tirelessly ply their craft to get at the truth. Rob Reiner plays the Knight Ridder managing editor John Wolcott, ably aided by a veteran journalist with 43 years of war behind him Joe Galloway, played by Tommy Lee Jones with spit and vinegar to season the relentlessness to get at the truth why Iraq? And they do it with a dedication that commands our respect, although at the time, many did not think so. As a news service Knight Ridder News served 30 odd newspapers, each one of which could choose to print or not what it got on the news wire. And in the case of the war, and here 'The Philadelphia Inquirer', a paper of heft chose not to. Nonetheless, 'Shock and Awe' deftly uses TV footage from C-Span, MSNBC, CNN and Fox News, mainly to bring to our eye and ear the machinations of the Bush White House to hoodwink the US public and the world that lying pays in pursuing an Iraq War that remains opened ended in 2018. It also use headlines from the 'Washington Post', especially 'The New York Times', whose Michael Gordon and especially Judith Miller spread the Bush line on the war, that no one but Knight Ridder challenged. Equally important is the method Wolcott encouraged of talking to the little people in the government to ferret out and build a case that Bush & co. were lying through their teeth; how they perverted intelligence, killed the career Of 5 star general Colin Powell who made a fool of himself at the UN Security Council hawking aluminum tubes as proof of Hussein's travelling nuclear arsenal. The sad tale is that everyone drank the Gatorade, but Knight Ritter. Jessica Biel, Milla Jovovich and Margo Moore are not taken in by the Bush lies. Equally interesting as background you see the unnamed heroes and heroines who came forward to connect the dots of this woeful story of lies, deceptions and made up facts. Ultimately, it was the disgraced Judith Miller whose words end the fil that 'Knight Ridder' was the only one that got it right'. 'Shock and Awe' probably won't do well at the box office, but it should be seen by journalism classes and school children as a learning tool of how truth matters. Reiner is a seasoned film maker and he know how to use close up, darkened room restaurants, long shoots to create a strong story line. He doesn't use 'Shock and Awe' to make us weep, but as a cautionary tale that vigilance and an informed citizenry is the price of liberty and freedom of the press."
Awe!,Spotlight,"Shock and Awe has an important message that is lost in an underwhelming even dull story.

After the 9/11 attacks, it was obvious somewhere in the middle east, a lot of people were going to die in reprisals from the USA. Much of the western media were cheerleaders in this. It did not matter if the press or television stations were conservative, liberal or meant to be neutral.

They wanted war with Afghanistan and could not wait for the invasion of Iraq. As far as journalists were concerned it was excitement. It is better to cover a battle than covering a story of complaints about street litter.

Lies and propaganda were lapped up without much critical appraisal. It was just not the US government, the UK government for example used the media to plant favourable stories that would link Saddam Hussein with Osama Bin Laden or that Iraq had WMDs.

Directed by Rob Reiner who also stars in this. Shock and Awe is based on the true story of the reporters from Knight Ridder. Jonathan Landay (Woody Harrelson) and Warren Strobel (James Marsden) were two reporters who called out the rubbish that was being fed to the American public in the build up to the Iraq invasion. They got flak, they got threats but they persevered and eventually vindicated some years later. Of course by then, most of the world came to believe that Iraq had no WMDs.

This should had been a sharp, hard hitting docu-drama in the style of All The President's Men. This was a clumsily told film that rehashed a history lesson.

Knight Ridder might have been proven to be right, the standards of journalism in recent years has not improved. It has gone even worse."
Awe!,The Best Newspaper Drama since All the Pres. Men and its Gets 5.1...a Shame.,"The film of the expose of an impending fraud surrounding the run up to the Iraq War by the Knight Ridder News Service is itself as expose of how ignorant people were kept at the time.

And the fact no one in the GW Bush Admin carried the can for the war and no impeachment took place does not bode well for our political system, Rob Reiner's film accuratelly tell a story that few at the time wanted to know and many wanted to forget after the bloody mess was over.

It is a warning to America for the future."

Awe!,"Dreck, Disguised as a Lesson, Disguised as an Editorial, Disguised as Cinema","Well THAT was interesting.

It only took 15 minutes for us to learn Rob Reiner and team had a HUGE axe to grind. This wasn't a movie, it wasn't even a movie with a message, it was a message wrapped around a movie. (See notes at the end.)

Sometimes Rob Reiner is a great filmmaker and sometimes Rob Reiner isn't a great filmmaker. With Shock and Awe, Reiner failed. Every three or four minutes he found some way to hit us over the head with his moral compass (ouch). That's certainly his right, but he did it with no subtlety whatsoever, and nobody likes being force-fed someone else's opinion. When a parent teaches a child that stoves are hot, the parent doesn't put the kid's hand on the burner. Instead, the parent illustrates the heat by showing its effects on something else - a pot of boiling water, maybe, or possibly even bringing the child's hand close to the burner. But Reiner didn't do that - he put the audience's hands directly on the burner and held them there for 90 minutes. I don't know about you, but I don't like being lectured, especially for an hour and a half.

If it weren't for the profanity I'd swear this was a TV Movie of the Week, including the gentle, bittersweet music underscoring various scenes. Seriously, this played just like a made-for-TV movie. Shock and Awe was technically proficient, but that was its ONLY saving grace.

If you watch Shock and Awe, please don't mistake it for serious, skilled filmmaking. It's neither.

NOTES

1. I don't dispute Reiner's opinion of what the Bush administration did and didn't do, and the facts bear that out. I have no quarrel with Reiner in that regard.

2. I worked in the newspaper industry for many years and I can say that the general tone of the newsroom scenes, at least at times, was inaccurate. At other times, it was spot-on. There tends to be a good deal of sarcastic humor floating about newsrooms, but it's kept in check when appropriate.

3. I'm a Navy veteran, for whatever that's worth. I only mention it so my dear readers (both of you) will have a better understanding of where I'm coming from as I write this review."
Awe!,Worth Watching,"Very educational for those unable to digest a thick book.

Especially for those, like my family members, who consider main stream media to be arbiters of truth. Alas Ed Murrow is longer active.

In the same vein as Spotlight or All the Presidents Men, but not as entertaining."
Awe!,"Great expectation, always let you down.","December 9, 2017 14th Dubai International Film Festival.

Entering the movie with the great expectations from the Director and the great star cast, may always let you down.

The movie is about a group of journalists during the most notorious 9/11 disaster. There are so many movies dealing with journalism and war. Actually, these kind of Biography, Drama and History are not my cup of coffee, yet I enjoyed some of them. This movie was a great disappointment to me. It really did not engage the audience.

The star cast was really shining and their performance was satisfactory. Try the film, if you like these kind of movies. Enjoy...!!!

Awe!,"Didactic and not subtle or cinematographic, but true","As a work of cinema, Shock and Awe is pretty mediocre. As far as production values, it seems like a Lifetime channel made-for-tv movie, and I see that it had only a limited release. That said, the film is a quasi-documentary, laying out many of the facts about how the United States was hoodwinked by a few hawks and neocons into the disastrous 2003 invasion of Iraq. Ignorant Americans really need to watch this as a part of general re-education to avoid yet another repeat of the same mistake (see also: Tonkin Gulf). Shock and Awe also should serve as a sober reminder of why it is absolutely insane to treat a group of war criminals as statesmen--as liberals have recently been doing in praising George W Bush and taking seriously the opinions of men such as Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Tony Blair. It is a mystery to me why anyone continues to seek out their opinions about anything. The misery, murder and mayhem caused directly by these people is inexcusable."
Awe!,Interesting story,Absorbing well told and well acted story with parallels to what is going on today.
Awe!,Excellence,"All news services got it wrong except one... Excellent cast, and depiction of the truth about what happened after 911. After 18 years. I also am still waiting for the WMD...Shame."
Awe!,A tale of unwavering persistence,"This film tells the story of several journalists who defies popular opinion and official viewpoints. They date to question the facts to find the real truth.

It is an engaging story of a seemingly impossible task. I feel empathic towards the journalists' lone fight against the masses. I admire their unwavering persistence."
Awe!,It could be applied to the events of today.,"This is a very thought provoking film. Its premise as in politicians forging data to suit policies as opposed to making policy to react to data is as relevant to the covid situation as it was to the Iraq war. Replace blackwater and the backhanders to ""rebuild"" Iraq with pharma and politicians friends who suddenly become PPE manufacturers being awarded million pound contracts and Johnson, hancock, Whittey etc become Bush, Rumsfeld Chaney and Powell... Bush was happy to see 30,000+ Americans die to achieve his aims and the governements of the word today add 15 years inflation to that figure quite happily."
Awe!,Unrealistic talking points,I could only stomach 1/2 of the movie before turning it off. Reiner preached liberal talking points about topics like fake intelligence in today's context and it comes across as extremely contrived and unrealistic. I say this as someone that would love to see all of the neocons held accountable for their actions; this just isn't a good way to dramatize the events. The Post is much more nuanced in its treatment of a similar topic.
Awe!,Historically Accurate,"I heard that this was an excellent movie, but then I read some of the highly critical reviews over on Netflix. So, I watched the movie myself to determine the truth. Let me give you a heads-up. All the negative reviews that appear as ""serious"" and ""sincere"" are written by George W. Bush administration apologists attempting to erase his failed, tarnished legacy. This movie is brilliant, not just for its production quality and performances of the highly renowned cast of professional actors, but most of all, for its historical accuracy. The Knight Ridder News Agency should forever be remembered for their heroic efforts to bring the truth to the American people during the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld promotion of the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq."
Awe!,Starts Off on the Wrong Note,"In some ways, this is excellent; however, the opening is garbage. Or perhaps it meant to depict the naivete of war volunteers. It is not easy to be sympathetic to a volunteer who expected a gentle, non-injurious war. The movie would have been far better without this scene. It is anti-heroic, and true heroism does not involve a paycheck or benefits.

The political message is clear in summarizing the falsehoods of Iraq. It harkens to the falsehoods of Viet Nam. When will America hold politicians financially culpable for the costs of fraudulence?

Excellent casting and performances; but a failure to recognize its own weakness in its inability to be wholly honest in all aspects. When we stop glorifying war and veterans, perhaps all of us will examine the motives for using mostly the poor as cannon fodder."
Awe!,"Important facts, poor execution, disappointing film","The film covers an important subject area, one that should serve as a warning for the future. Unfortunately the film felt rushed and flat. They tried so hard to be like the movie Spotlight, but this film came across more as a check list of events leading up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq than a story about investigative journalists. I didn't care for the characters or their journeys because the film didn't give them room to breathe or develop. It was just like ""this source says that"" in scene after scene. Whereas Spotlight really showed how investigative journalism works, and how the job affected those reporters, Shock and Awe is just like this stuff happened and it's important. It could have been a great movie, but poor execution and unnaturally shoehorned in exposition to educate the audience hinder the drama of the story."
Home for Christmas,Relief,"After trying to find a good watch for Christmas, this is, after the usual US cliche bs which made nearly my eyes fall out from all the eyerolling, finally a nice little series with believable and likeable characters and story.

Yes it's possible, a good story without time traveling knights and laughtracks.

Thank you Norway."
Home for Christmas,Heartwarming nice story with a sweet main actor,"It's fun and light hearted, just how Christmas should be"
Home for Christmas,What real families look like,"I am so happy I found this! Its Scandinavian (Norwegian) short series about a girl and the pressure that is being put on her. She is 30 and ""boyfriendless"", which in her families eyes means that she is incomplete. The quest to prove to her family that she is ""normal"" and has a boyfriend by the family Christmas dinner time begins!

There is clearly the ""Love actually"" influence there and you better love that movie too!

The ending will leave you restless! I hope Netflix will create more European series/movies like this!

Home for Christmas,Very pleasant to see,"Judging by the title I supposed that it was another christmas comedy. Nevertheless, the whole plot was about Johanne and her attempts to find a suitable boyfriend (at first just for not to be alone at christmas). The nice story has some cliches but it's funny and with great acting for a comedy. And that counts for first and secondary roles too. It's not a revelation, it's not the most original script ever, but it's well written and properly directed. I would fully recommend it. I even enjoyed the language. It was something different to listen to. I binged watched it asap. Have fun."

Home for Christmas,"Just the right choice of light happy, yet valuable watch for the season.","Normally I would have given it 7/10, but watching it in the xmas spirit, and in particular compared with most of the American garbage xmas movies and series, I increased the rating to 8. As someone from a non-Christian culture, I truly enjoyed watching the original, traditional warmth that I felt in this series as compared with all the commercial fake xmas I feel in the North America. As someone who has never bern able to relate to the North American style xmas celebration, I have to admit this series gave me the cozy warm feeling I have always felt since childhood in our new year celebrations... The warmth of something traditional and way way more original than just pushing people to go to the mall. In this sense, I really loved this series.

In addition, I also appreciate it very much that unlike the mainstream North American series and movies (especially the Christmas ones) that keep emphasizing on how sad and needy and incomplete single women above a certain age are and they'd be happy only upon clinging to a man, this one tries to show that a woman, as is, is enough for herself and must not let all the social pressure and family expectations push her to settle on something that doesn't make her happy. I love how it shows that Johanna, despite all her doubts in herself, all her ups and downs, all her occasional bending when it comes to family pressure, does not settle for something less than what she deserves. I love her very normal realistic character, having her weak moments, melt downs, relying on friends and family at times of need, but at the same time being an independent reliable person in the lives of her family, friends, colleagues, and her patients. I love that despite all the occasional moments of feeling weak or like a loser, she eventually uses her support network to dry her tears and goes back on her feet. It is sooooo like the opposite of the American mainstream garbage advertises. I love how in the first episode it emphasizes how single people are ignored by all the commercial culture (no xmas set edition of pyjamas for singles, just couples and family).

Moreover, I also enjoyed the very real sense of humour and sensible jokes in the series.

All in all, nothing very deep or extraordinary, but a great light happy ""right"" choice for Christmas season, especially a Christmas like this one with all the COVID-related restrictions."
Home for Christmas,Bravo Norway...,"I just spent pretty much a whole day binging on this Netflix original during the lockdown here. Wow! This is a brilliant Christmas TV series. I had fun watching this one. The acting was great, and the story was wonderful to watch on screen. I laughed a lot. Plus, it is just great watching something from a Nordic country. A bit different humour. Well done!"
Home for Christmas,NETFLIX DID IT RIGHT,Superb funny story with twist in the end that. twist are not the twist you are waiting for.
Home for Christmas,Mostly watchable about loneliness and being there for other people,"Seems the lead role is a sweet and kind woman, although she has lots of tattoos of knife through skull and more. I think the series is a bit awkward at times, but also touching, sweet and funny. The men she dates are quite hopeless, but in some ways I think the film tries to say that noone is perfect and we all have our demons and stuff that we try to hide away and that we hope someone can love despite of. In the end we get a lesson about seeing the qualities of all the good people around us."
Home for Christmas,Do not watch the dubbed version please.,Actually quite good and charming. Norwegian feel good. The dubbed version is awful
Home for Christmas,Sad commentary on life,"Johanna is pressured by absolutely everyone to couple up, breed, and live the same dull life as every one else.

The least they could do is get some farm animals or baubles in exchange for their daughter."
Home for Christmas,What a pleasant surprise,"I watched it all in one sit. I found myself laughing and crying with this show... I could relate to the protagonist so much and I was laughing out loud at times, just because some stuff is so genuine! I'm in love with this show, because I'm her age, recently relocated to a new country and I'm going through the same ""putting yourself out there"" phase, and it's so amusing to see a TV show that portraits that so well without being cheesy, the ups and downs of dating and being single. I highly recommend it!!!"

Home for Christmas,Was Not Expecting That!,"I usually skip over subtitled TV shows but I got so into the characters and the story I almost forgot I was reading while watching! This is charming, quirky, and heartfelt series. The ending - WOW! I gasped. I NEED TO KNOW!!"
Home for Christmas,Nicely written show,"Home for Christmas is a good story with a lot of believable characters with faults, including the main character. You can definitely see that the writers have taken their time with the backstories of the characters, that slowly surface during the season

At some time it felt like the series had too many characters for such a short season, and ends up feeling a bit rushed, throwing the protagonist from character to character. However, the series is still well worth a watch and I'm looking forward to season 2."

Fractured,I was wrong.,I was wrong and then I was wrong again. Good twists.
Fractured,A very solid thriller.,"Firstly, ignore the bad reviews.

This movie is a solid thriller. Great acting and interesting idea. It will keep you guessing until the end.

You could do a lot worse than watch this on Netflix.

Recommended."
Fractured,Go In Blind,"I really enjoyed this film. Clearly things aren't quite right, but it's hard to say throughout what is true and what isn't. It kept me guessing and kept my interest. It's not horror but a thriller, no jump scares or horrific stuff. The acting is solid. The atmosphere is quite tense. The child isn't annoying for once. In some ways it's quite a poignant reflection on the power of love. Very good evening's entertainment.

Fractured,Glad i didnt read the IMDB rating!,"Because then i would probably skip this movie.

Both my fiance and I really enjoyed this movie!"
Fractured,Could have been fantastic if the last 10 min matched the rest,"Reviewers are harsh to rate it so low when only the last part is blah. True, if you only care about the destination and not the journey, and you've seen a lot of similar movies you might be disappointed. But it's a very well done thriller and worth watching nonetheless. Apparently a lot of people expected what happens, but a lot didn't so your mileage may vary. I did, and while I wish they found a way to blow my mind in the end, I'm not going ""oh I'm so smart, you didn't stimulate my superior brain, your movie sucks"" and I just enjoyed the ride. Kinda like re-watching a movie you like, you know what's coming but it's still good."

Fractured,Expect the unexpected.,"Fractured is a mystery thriller, I'd agree with that, but the one tag that's missing, is surreal. It's a very odd film, so odd it's almost bonkers, it's like being in a nightmare, you can't wake up, all events are out of your control, and every aspect of life is spiraling out of control. I won't give a single spoiler away, because it would give the game away, all I could say is expect the unexpected. I predicted events and outcomes, I got every single sequence of events wrong, loaded with twists and crammed full of intrigue. Sam Worthington is terrific.

It's trippy, it's slow to start, but great as it gets going, think The Lady vanishes. 7/10"
Fractured,Solid thriller,Comentario no disponible
Fractured,"A nice quick 90s style VHS thriller, and Sam's pretty good too.","Went into this film knowing not a lot, it is all muted greys and looks like a Brad Anderson film. The first 20 minutes are a nice set up of family discord and inferiority, then the thriller starts, and gradually gets more and more paranoid, like a less fluffy version of the long forgotten Hugh Grant/Gene Hackman movie 'Extreme Measures'. Sam Worthington does nice work as a broken human being, it's only just over 90mins which is perfect and feels just like a midweek trip to Blockbusters. A nice surprise on a rainy day."
Fractured,No surprise,"I had hopes this would be a suspenseful thriller, but from the very beginning you actually know the twists and turns. The plot becomes very predictable, that even during the ending when the movie tries to place you in doubt of what you believed, you still know what to expect.

The whole film drags the agonizing thought of one man suffering and the suspense doesn't stay intact. Some parts have a little bit of intrigue, but that's just about it. Everything else comes off a very cliché."
Fractured,"IMO, last 5 minutes actually made it good, contrary to what people are saying",Comentario no disponible
Fractured,Not the best but entertaining and thrilling,"So... It's a straight to Netflix movie. I was not expecting some Oscar nominated performances or plotlines. It's October and Halloween is around the corner and I just wanted to snuggle up and watch a decent thriller and I believe this movie accomplished what I was looking for. It was psychological, suspenseful and actually had very great acting by the main character played by Sam Worthington. The rest of the cast was quite forgetable but not terrible by any means.

I don't want to spoil the plot but I will just say that the movie was a lot of fun and it did keep me guessing until the very end so that is definitely an added bonus."
Fractured,Huge plot holes that give away the story!,Comentario no disponible
Fractured,I nearly missed a great thriller because of reviews here..,".. Thanks to the reviewer who advised that we ignore the negative reviews, I nearly missed this great thriller. Great pacing, it leaves you wanting to see what comes next. Please just watch it."
Fractured,Predictable but enjoyable,"I was expecting (and hoping for) the twists this movie offers, especially the last one. But it didn't diminish my enjoyment of this solid thriller. If you like stories that question the reality, this one is for you. Not amazingly original, but certainly much better than Unsane, which I saw yesterday and, amazingly, which didn't offer any twists at all."
Fractured,Mindblown,It's been so long since I've watch a mind blowing flick and I'm so meticulous when it comes to this type of genre but man fractured really nailed it. The writer really played his mind when crafting the story plus the cinematography and direction added to intensified the scenes never thought Sam Worthington is good at this I mean his glory days as a Titan son of Zeus was over but man he sure is a versatile actor.
Fractured,Not exactly subtle.,It's fairly obvious from early on and Sam's acting is very easy to spot as well. I'd guess that anyone with an understanding of hospitals and psychiatry will be screaming in disbelief at this but other than that it's an okay basic thriller.

Fractured,Okay but not great...,I wanted to like this but the ending wasn't strong enough for me. I think that's what it came down to. The movie didn't come full circle enough for me and it felt like the ending wasn't really complete. I found myself getting kind of bored throughout. Sam worthington is likable but there wasn't enough twists for me. Everything was kind of meh.
Fractured,Not good,"I mean, the subject is already done. Seen it before. I think the movie tries too hard and falls flat. I felt irritated when it all ended and did not feel anything for the main character. It was too dramatic and i could not buy in to the concept. I regret watching it. If you have alot of time to kill then maybe... but i will give you an alternative......-> see something else."
Fractured,Very good movie,"Predictable my ass. I had 3 possible endings and none of them happened.

The movie starts out very slow then heats up fast.

It was a solid mind game for the 2nd half of the movie and didn't stop till the end.

Eerie....creepy....intense.

I really liked it. Well worth the time and I would watch it again."
Fractured,"Great movie of this genre, lots of second guessing...","Even though you seen it done a few times before, this movie is great. The story moves along at a good pace and keeps you guessing. My wife and I was always changing our mind on what was happening and kept us both on edge of our seats. Great acting. And the end was good, no wishy washy ending, a solid answer!"

Legacies,Bored,Am getting sick and bored of the repetitive disappearance of London and Hope going to find. Hope was waay awesome in The Originals. Her hybrid potential is getting wasted in this Legacies. They are running out of ideas for the show. Think eventually the show will be canceled. Legacies is a disgrace to The Originals & Vampire Diaries.
Legacies,A Plot Driven by Lies,"As a younger adult, I am able to relate with this show and the lives of the teenagers in it. Charismatic characters like MG and Kaleb are a joy to watch, and Landon with his deadpan deliveries and budding emotions stand out in the sea of other teenage personalities. Hope is a strong and likable lead, but she acts too much like an adult, even if she is powerful.

There is a strong theme of honesty in this show, or rather, the lack thereof. Almost all of the main and supporting actors have lied multiple times. These lies and/or the revelation of truths are constant plot drivers and climaxes of every episode. Some of these lies are unnecessary and exaggerated, and it breaks the immersion of the show as you tell yourself ""that doesn't make any sense."" Even though ""Legacies"" takes place in a fictional world, the human parts, like dialogue and decision-making, are unbelievable as they would not normally happen with regular people.

This show is good, but fewer lies and relatable dialogue can make it great. One of the reasons its predecessor, The Originals, is so great is because it was often no-nonsense and straightforward. Even though the age gap between the characters of both shows numbers in the thousands, that does not excuse the inauthenticity of character interactions."
Legacies,I think it will only get better.,Comentario no disponible
Legacies,Potential for more,Comentario no disponible
Legacies,Should have stopped after The Orignals,"The first season itself does no justice to the previous series ( TVD an TO) Too much of Hope and Landon drama ( which is clearly not required) Way to many plots and twists, overaged actors for underage characters (Lizze, Kaleb,...)"
Legacies,Really not that bad,Honestly it's not that bad. I've seen far worse. For those who are annoyed about it 'expanding the universe' it's really no different to what Fantastic Beasts has done for Harry Potter. I find it watchable enough and will continue to give it a go. Don't let other reviews make up your mind for you. Give it a go and see what you think.
Legacies,Not as good as vampire diaries or the originals,"I'm honestly very disappointed in this show. I was expecting it to be like The Originals, instead they made it all childish and for kids. The plot is very confusing and there's new characters each epsiode. They dont even give the characters a real personality they just toss them aside. Not to mention how Hope, the most powerful person ever, is portrayed so weak. The villains are childish monsters. I really hope season 3 is better because I'm really disappointed."
Legacies,Quite impressed,As a big fan of both the originals and vampire diaries I was very unimpressed when they came to an end so was very excited when another spin off was in the works. I absolutely loved the first episode of legacies I think hope is such a good mix of both klaus and Haley and I'm really looking forward to how her character evolves she has Haley's soft side and compassion but also the fire of klaus is just under the surface I can't wait for the next episode. I love it.
Legacies,Why is everyone hating on this show ?,"It's not that bad ! They're targeting a different audience with a younger generation of vampires, wolves and newer creatures, but didn't Vampire Diaries also start with Elena, Caroline and Bonnie as teenagers? The show is gripping with some sort of okay acting and new mythical challenges everyday.

Don't compare it to the dark nature of the originals, which was a different ball game altogether. But this show on its own, is pretty entertaining to watch !"
Legacies,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I have watched TVD and TO like 5 times each.. i am IN LOOOVE with the story, the characters, the depths of everything as i am crazy about the cast! This legacies series have disappointed me and every one i know who were fans of TO and TVD.. I mean come on, we have lost the essence of werewolves, vampires and witches to mythical monsters without a background story! The villains are RIDICULOUS with terrible acting! and seriously.. they put a mascot to play a wolf ? what is this? Red riding hood volume 2 ?

Hope is the daughter of the greatest character of all three series.. Julie Plec ruined her and her character and this is not the legacy (pun intended) that the previous shows have left behind! Honestly i keep watching this in respect to the originals and the vampire diaries and in hope that the pas 11 years of addiction to these series might be worth continuing.

What a shame !"
Legacies,Great series potential,"This series is fresh, creative with a cast and plot with so much potential - not as heavy as Vampire Diaries and Originals - I actually preferred it - kept me interested without heavy intensity"
Legacies,What happened,Comentario no disponible
Legacies,First episode only,I'm pleasantly thrilled about another spinoff from the vampire diaries. I didn't care for the originals but this looks promising for me. The first episode was nice and I'm ready for more 👌🏾
Legacies,A let down for watchers of The Originals,"Im sure anyone who loved the Originals was eager to check out its spinoff, but this does Not carry on the Legacy, pun intended...The Originals was intense, adult, and superbly acted whereas the the spinoff comes across as a typical teen agnst,soapy,Harry potter meets xaviers school from xmen kind of vib..It is full of siliness, fantasy, monster of the week nonsense withe the shallowest of storylines and poor acting from the young ones...Granted,they Are kids, but THIS kid, Hope, could have been the center around which a serious,dark themed layered story could have been written... she has a dark past, dark parents and scarey levels of power that could be tapped in her and stories built around her dealing with the Legacy that her parents left her with..THATS what id like to see! Not this kidsy ,silly monster, harry potter themed stuff...im still watching becuz i love Anything with vampire,werewolf,mutant, witches or superpowered beings ,but this show needs to shift gears into seriousness, touch upon Hopes dark side, and make the show more about That ,otherwise its going down the toilet after 1 season.."
Legacies,The Lovechild of TWD and TO,"I like the way they are handling the story, I like that they merged all of the werewolf, witch, vampire, stuff; instead of focusing only to one of them, they are using these creatures to probably fight a battle that is to come but together. I think the premise of the show is intriguing that they, these mythical creatures, are all somehow forgotten, and they are now coming back. Even though the first few episodes are a bit shaky, it definitely worth the watch and the time. I personally cannot wait for a new episode because I want to know more about, why those creatures were forgotten, who did that, why are they coming back now. Last one is important because I think it can be connected with the existence of Hope. She is an impossible creature herself. You shouldn't go into this waiting for something like TWD or TO or waiting for cameos from those shows, they do happen but try to connect with the new characters. I like the references to those shows but these are the new generation."
Legacies,Great start!!,Comentario no disponible
Legacies,Long live the legacies,I watched the premeire of this show tonight and let me tell you I was on the edge of my seat.amazing show beautiful girls perfect pace if all episodes are like this I definitely want more
Legacies,The sequel we all deserved,Hope taking on the main role or Elena 2.0 as some have said was a great choice. Writing has made the female main character a strong woman rather than the Elena damsel in distress trope. I'm also super happy they kept some of the characters from vampire diaries and didn't reboot with a 100% brand new cast. I'm very excited to see where this show goes!
Legacies,Outstanding,Brilliant Show. Loved Vampire Diaries And The Originals. So Glad This Came Out. Wasn't Ready To For The Shows And Characters To End. So Glad The Story Continues!!
Legacies,From humble beginnings do legacies develop,I loved both Vampire Diaries and the Originals and was gutted when they both ended so when I heard of this spin off I was excited! Minus a few dodgy episodes I have found this first season a good building ground for future seasons great climax to the season left me looking forward to season 2. Hopefully in season 2 it can mature storyline wise and reach its potential. It is still better than many shows just not as good as the Originals but given time maybe.
Legacies,Doesn't compare to TVD or TO,"Legacies isn't horrible but it's definitely for a younger audience. You might as well deal with the pain once you finish TVD and TO and move on rather than cling to this last ounce of hope (haha). This show had so much more potential that was pretty much ignored. It adds in tons of mythical creatures which could've been interesting only they made it so immature. It's honestly as if the writer became a middle schooler over night. Another thing is the acting. I'm sorry but other than (Obviously Rick) Josie, Lizzie, Landon, and Hope (who can be a stretch most times) , the actors and actresses either have little talent or are not given the platform to properly present their talent. I think we all had high expectations to which few were met. I'm so disappointed to be saying this and truly wish it were different, but don't waste your time unless you have nothing else to do."
Legacies,Wow a lot of haters,I like it! Of course it's no VD or originals.. but I like it a lot! I hope they bring in some classic characters but so far I like it!
Legacies,Fun for fans of the other series in the universe,Comentario no disponible

Ancient Apocalypse,You don't need to accept Hancock's theory to find it entertaining and the questions posed provocative,Comentario no disponible
Ancient Apocalypse,"ancient humans, Joe rogan and an ice age later","Okay, so I watched this cause I'm an archaeology buff and I have to say I'm divided. On the one hand, this guy has a perfectly believable point which is that History as we know it is basically incomplete because we are missing large parts of time in our records due to war and cataclysm. That's a theory I can absolutely get behind. He essentially states that we have forgotten more ancient, advanced civilisations than we currently know. So in this theory Sumeria is not the oldest by far and human ""civilised"" history is actually several millenia older. Again I might be inclined to get behind that. He chalks up this amnesia to the ice age and willing ignorance from the academia. Having been in the academia myself I cam confirm that it can be stifling place full of people who are extremely reluctant to admit they might not hold the absolute, final truth so again far enough. But then it takes a turn into crazy Mulder conspiracy land. Not only is academia narrow-minded and humankind amnesiac, no. The truth is that all ancient civilisations are descended from a single super ancient, super advanced forgotten civilisation. And the evidence for this is that a bunch of them have kind of similar legends about their origins. So basically I sorta of agree with his premise but his conclusion is banana pants. He completely throws out the scientific method and he absolutely does cherry pick his legends and his facts. Being from one of the countries he visits and talks about I can confirm that the legends of my country he chose isn't even the most common one. This guy uses a very effective method to try and convince people which is he mixes up facts with the unknown and people's inherent desire for the mysterious to have meaning and then leads you down a very odd rabbit hole. I'm giving it 6 stars cause some of the things he says and presents are interesting enough that I'll read about them later on but also because he kinda goes down a cray cray path there. Oh and one star down because he talked to Joe Rogan."
Ancient Apocalypse,"It will either tickle your imagination, or wrath.","This Netflix series will either inspire or attract ridicule. I don't think there will be much in-between.

If I were to shape my world view exclusively based on peer-reviewed pieces of science I would live in the most dull, meaningless and senseless world possible.

When I acknowledge that I don't know about something, I love some fresh perspectives which let me evaluate based on at least something so banal as what probability could this have?

If your conclusion is that the probability of what's presented is next to non-existent then this mini-series is not for you.

If you, even if you didn't understand why but seemed to relate, however unexplainable, to something about this series, I can highly recommend it.

I gave Michael Polland's mini-series, How To Change Your Mind, a 10 because it communicated from the heart, from the beginning to the end.

I'll give this an 8 because how much it can engage your mind, if you let it.

But the Spartan 300 trailer soundtrack and ultra-dramatic narration maybe expressed the creator's enthusiasm and sense of urgency more than analyzing what people will relate to.

Regardless, I believe this series will be a starting point of a massive movement of questioning our past, and to be fair, that was its intention all along 😊I don't think it is meant to convince, but meant to make you try on a wider perspective."
Ancient Apocalypse,"If Gobekli Tepe is that old, all the ancient history we've learned","Is wrong.

Some of you here claim Hancock ""has no proof"" - yet Gobekli Tepe is scientifically proven - not by Hancock - to be as old, as he claims it to be. Google the site and see what age you can find.

Once again - Gobekli and Karahan Tepe are indeed around 11-12 thousand years old (- which is universally agreed at this point), then everything they ever taught us about our ancient history is simply wrong.

Imagine, we have suddenly discovered some new information - just like some started to claim a few hundred years ago, that Earth isn't flat or that the sun doesn't orbit around Earth - people who claimed this, were burned alive, because scientists of that time ""knew better"". Now we all (well most of us) agree with this as a fact. In a few decades, all the kids will know about Gobekli Tepe and hopefully many other places yet to be discovered and it will be accepted.

You can't have it both ways - there was this joke about an old man at the zoo, looking at a giraffe all day long. Giraffe was walking around, chewing on the leaves, resting. The man was just shaking his head. They were closing up for the day and asked the man to leave. As he was leaving, he said ""that animal you have there cannot possibly exist, it just makes no sense.."", he walked away still shaking his head.

I was on Malta in 1997, visited most of the megalithic sites - they told us, ""these are the oldest man made structures in the world"" - well, and they were wrong. (Unless they are not 5-6 thousand years old - as they thought, but are also 11 thousand + years old - in which case, the scientists were very wrong still - wrong at establishing the real construction date). In 1997, it was universally believed, that it was a fact. Gobekli Tepe was only discovered/serious digs started in 94/95, it took a few years to determine the actual age.

Graham Hancock dares to ask questions.

He dares to say (and I am paraphrasing) ""well, if Gobekli Tepe is admittedly this old - you have to admit, you were wrong about our history. Our ancestors from that era obviously weren't nearly as primitive, as you claim. What else did you get wrong? What else do you claim, although you have no proof for whatsoever? Let's investigate, let's study, let's talk about it""

The self assured, but very obviously mistaken historians and archaeologists: ""no, you're a pseudo-scientist""

Oh, OK then...

There's no way, they were building such structures, while being just hunters and gatherers - although that's what these series also claim.

Why and how would you build all that, while having no certainty, that you can have enough food in the surrounding area? Unless you can grow your own food and raise your own animals, you'd never do that - unless it was some ""garden of eden"", with nothing but endless supply of food growing and running around.

But anyway, let's imagine for a while, that a huge cataclysm destroys most of the world in the next few days. You survive, a few thousand people around the world survive, but no technology survives. No internet. Most roads are gone, no electricity, no running water, no medical care..

...then some brainiac 20 thousand years from now asks - ""so, if those people did exist and were not primitive, were are their houses? Where's their rubbish"" - well, my friend, it's overgrown, under the sea, disintegrated - did you really expect your particular timber, or brick house will survive 10- 20 thousand years? After a cataclysm? Think about it. Look at a 100 year old abandoned shed. Now imagine it in 5 thousand years, 10 thousand years. What is it going to look like? All the huge pyramids in Mexico were overgrown - it only took a few hundreds of years of neglect, it all became a jungle.

You know what could possibly survive all that? - such as a huge cataclysm and possibly ten thousand + years of climate change, vegetation grow, nature taking over in general? - A huge, megalithic structure, ideally burried under ground..like Gobekli Tepe and others.

Is Graham Hancock right about everything? No, he doesn't have to be.

And remember one more thing, while you're reading this and clicking thumbs down on my comment, on this wonderful website.. somewhere in a remote jungle, there's a small slender guy, chasing some squirrel sized animal with a spear or a blowgun, which is the most advanced piece of technology, that he ever held in his possession. You and this little savage guy can live at the same time, living totally different lives, a few thousand km from each other. His people will live like that for another bunch of thousands of years, unless we interfere with their lifestyle.

In 2024, you still have modern people and primitive savages living ""side by side""..if you have these savages living in stone age conditions today in Amazon jungle, how can anyone in their right mind claim, that it wasn't like that also 12 thousand or more years ago?

Those Amazon rainforest tribes could never build their own Gobekli Tepe today and they would never ever try, it would never occur to them - ""hey, let's build this huge, megalithic structure.."". Maybe in a few thousand or tens of thousands of years they eventually would. Those people are the hunters and gatherers.

Builders of Gobekli Tepe were obviously far ahead of that. So you want a proof - other, than it's scientifically proven, that these sites are that old? Here's your proof - today's hunter and gatherers have built nothing but some primitive shacks. And it's 2024."
Ancient Apocalypse,Fascinating,"You can remember people like Galileo, who would stand against established truths and the people of power would be against him... Honestly I do not have any problems with this theory as suddenly a whole lot of stuff starts to make sense... Why would ancients waste so much time and effort to build 36 underground cities in Turkey, why would they build massive temples to observe the stars so precisely, why would the symbols of serpents would be so common in multiple cultures and finally all the prophets stories that are present in almost every ancient culture, when a man sent by the gods would come and teach a young civilization some knowledge that would either speed up the culture or improve their lives... What Graham Hancock did is analysed a lot of information and unified it into a single theory, well nobody says it was exactly like that, no one will tell, that is why it is called a theory and I have completely nothing about it's existence..."
Ancient Apocalypse,Some reviewers misinterpret,"This held my attention pretty well. I thought it was a bit overly rhetorical at parts and that the editing of (most of) his interviews with field experts or ""buffs"" (his term) really zeroed in on whatever sound bits propagated his precise message, otherwise ignoring most of what they might've contributed.

Some of the reviews here state that he offered no ""proof"" of a prehistoric advanced civilization, and that pyramids, stone temples and such are not ""advanced"". On the contrary, the point he's trying to argue is that a global cataclysm would've wiped out all traces of any prehistoric advanced people, and that if there are traces, they may exist in places we haven't looked or been willing to look (which he gives examples of). He's arguing that, in fact, the scale of construction endeavors (megaliths, pyramids, subterranean structures), and the astronomical designs/orientations seen in them are advanced enough to suggest a level of knowledge and sophistication that could only have been passed down from earlier humans, thus indicating that they must've been constructed at more of a resource, technology, and population 'reset' than the beginning of human life as we know it. In other words, the primitive hunter-gatherer groups that archaeologists currently believe were the earliest humans couldn't have just up & created these structures, all at around the same time--nor would they have had any reason to unless motivated by stories of fear & suffering from an apocalypse.

He dumps on archaeologists a lot, but seems to offer some reasonable explanations for it: he says they discount theories while refusing to look into them; that they refuse to excavate certain places; that they are not motivated to correct people's understanding of history even as new science proves old science to be incorrect.

I can see that, to be honest. It's not that I know much about archaeology specifically, but it is a field wrapped in academia, which comes with all sorts of funding, political, and bureaucratic issues, all while the people involved are necessarily as passionate about furthering their own careers (and maybe supporting themselves) as they might be about furthering human knowledge. Ideas/projects that get funding are often within the comfort zones of various interconnected institutions, following ever similar paths, expanding on existing ideas, etc. This kind of thing exists all over academia. Look up Drs. Karikó and Weismann re: how long it took to get funding for mRNA vaccine research, for example.

I'm gonna find myself some popcorn and look forward to hearing/reading any archaeology community response to this."
Ancient Apocalypse,Questions now create controversy?,"If his motivation for making this film was merely asking questions about natural phenomenons & seemingly, forgotten landmarks, then this show has some defining moments. I do feel like he throws around a lot of dates, and treats thousands of years very loosely in his episodes, but his David Attenborough oration made this show more entertaining. The music & zoomed in angles made some moments a little overdramatic, which disconnected our thoughts from the story. Was the show thought provoking, yes, was is it entirely factually supported, no. This show has created many good questions & raised some interesting hypotheses. Why does a show like this create an apocalypse of his own, an a apocalypse of vitriol. His ideas are interesting, and this creates more investigations in to these suggestions. One thing we know, is those sites exist, and the monoliths and sites are old, so someone must have built them with more knowledge then clubs & loin clothes. This is indeed a thought provoking show, but remember, he is still throwing out ideas. If anything, this show has an entertainment value, but if this show doesn't provide accuracy to the ancient culture of forgotten history, then at least the show has shed some light on the current academic narrow mindedness of ancient history already has been answered. Whether you agreed with his viewpoint or not, we can see how this show has created interesting conversations & intriguing further study."
Ancient Apocalypse,An interesting theory,"Hancock leads us on a nice and tidy path of his research and field of interest during the past decades, and gives us an compelling theory of lost civilizations due to global cataclysm.

Critics of this documentary series seem to dislike Hancock for his rejection of consensus in fields like archeology and geology, or dislike Hancock for being arrogant and bitter (in rather arrogant and bitter wording themselves).

Personally I find the theory well substantiated, enough to warrant more interest and research. I'm filled with a burning desire to see more of the submerged structures, and to excavate areas that have only been found via LiDAR scanning.

If you'd like to dip your toe into some groundbreaking theories relating to ancient civilizations, and the possible reasons for so little remaining for us to find, this is an excellent start."
Ancient Apocalypse,An Pragmatic Review,"Having read both the scholarly papers for archaeological sites as well as Graham's books over the last few decades, they both seem to be at war with each other. While thought provoking, vivid, and beautifully filmed, this documentary falls short on what could have been a great response to ""big archaeology"" by Graham.

His theories are beginning to gain steam. However, I can't help but wonder how many of the individuals he interviews (including himself) are victims to selection bias. Some of his speculations brought forth in the episode (specifically the Sirius one) seem so far-fetched that it often feels like he's drawing conclusions from nothing. I was hoping this documentary would be more detailed. Unfortunately, it is very clear it was made for entertainment instead of data. I hope, if one is green-lit, a sophomore effort will be more detailed, both for our sake and for Graham's sake. I think it would benefit the masses and academia alike to consider non-mainstream ideas. My final thought-Archaeologists require massive funding for monumental projects- just food for thought on how money (and who owns it) can control a narrative. Graham's work here aims to poke holes in that narrative."
Ancient Apocalypse,Where's the proof?,"The whole show can be wrapped to this: ""mainstream archeology doesn't believe me when I say there was an ancient civilization. I won't show any proof but mainstream archeology doesn't believe me. Mainstream archeology is all against me. Mainstream mainstream mainstream. No proof but mainstream and I'm right.""

I thought he would actually show some proof or even theories, but he just goes around the world and ""asks questions"" with no explanations. And of course goes into ""maybe some ancient civilization taught all these people to do things.""

There may have been an ancient civilization, but a single person just blaming ""mainstream archeology"" for not believing them isn't going to get anyone to believe him either."
Ancient Apocalypse,It's concerning that this is what we call Docuseries,"This isn't a very well made show at all. It feels like something they made for a NatGeo show back in the 2000s but much less factual. The amount of slow-motion, pan-over drone shots of the worksite and Graham Hancock power-posing seem to outnumber the frames that actually meaningfully push the content forward.

Essentially the show continuously presents archaeological evidence that refutes the typical timeline of human history, which Hancock insists must be because of this advanced ancient civilization we've lost contact with. There's no evidence though of these mystical capabilities.

It genuinely feels like Graham Hancock is just showing up to various active archeological sites with a film crew, asking the workers questions, and then splicing out the parts of the interview that may further the ongoing narrative. I'm not convinced that the archaeologists presenting their findings are doing so in support of his theory, they're just having individual frames of content being mined out of interviews and interaction.

Why is this concerning? It's a film that has been made professionally enough to be called documentary even though it's not factual. Someone who doesn't really have a whole lot of attachment to the issue would probably entertain this as a factual documentary without looking too critically at it. And someone who is a genuine conspiracy theorist would allow this to feedback into their disbelief in genuine science anyway.

Could go on on, but I'll stop here."
Ancient Apocalypse,Content for the curious,"I love this documentary. It's a great step forward in utilizing journalism to challenge mainstream notions of science and history. Great storyline. Amazing if anything. It takes you through the journey Hancock theorizes quite smoothly helping the viewer understand the mysticism.

History and anthropology buffs will enjoy this in particular because of how much connections they can make between their own knowledge and what Hancock is trying to show us.

There are some missed connections in the telling and analysis of events mostly due to not enough attention on local and lost folklore of the locations in question (specifically the ones in the ME less in SA sites). The sites in Turkey for example have many stories connected to them from local people or regional populations who also carry the same history. But nonetheless it's a 10/10 because Hancock makes sure he doesn't miss anything else."
Ancient Apocalypse,Interesting but very speculative,Comentario no disponible
Ancient Apocalypse,Sensationalist Nonsense,"'Ancient Apocalypse' is an often confused, and generally arrogant, attempt to sensationalize history through one person's insistence of a rather ridiculous idea, and his desire to pick a fight with archaeologists, historians, and scientists.

Graham Hancock insists, on the one hand, how archaeologists and scientists all around the world have locked themselves into this one idea of human history, and are unwilling to change their perspective in light of new archaeological evidence.

On the other hand, he takes all the evidence, the myths and legends of diverse cultures, and any facts, hints, and suggestions he can find, and twists them all to fit into his own idea of an incredibly advanced, forgotten ancient civilization while doing exactly what he constantly accuses academics of doing: not being willing to accept anything which defies their own perception.

He has visited some amazing places, found some fascinating links between separate cultures across history, and maybe even come up with a few half-decent ideas about why we need to continue extensive research into our past to better understand our ancient ancestors.

However, the biggest conclusion he has drawn is largely nonsensical. The way he keeps implying ancient humans could not have progressed as they did, to discover agriculture and build large monuments and structures, without the help of some advanced civilization forgotten by history is plain arrogant, insulting, extremely annoying, and rather hypocritical given he accuses archaeologists of the very same arrogance he displays himself."
Ancient Apocalypse,Astonishing,"As someone who probably like most stumbled upon Graham Hancock and his work from the JRE experience am so happy he has got this show. I just started it, and it's already just astonishing. I have followed and listened to him and Randall Carlson on the rogan experience every single time they went on, which is usually 3+ hours of just unbelievable information they give us. I cannot wait to continue to watch this series as I will burn through it tonight.

I'm so grateful that rogans podcast is so powerful that Graham and I'm sure eventually Carlson will get their say in matters that are closed off by the archeological and scientific world and THAT THIS is the only way of thinking. Also gives me the opportunity to talk to people that actually might watch this show instead of me regurgitating from the podcast and sounding like a lunatic.

Kudos."
Ancient Apocalypse,Compelling,"I binge-watched the entire series in one sitting, and it held my attention for the entire 8 hours. Graham Hancock brings us on a tour of ancient archeological sites from civilizations around the world, tying them together with a shared history of a global cataclysm that cut humanity off from its ancient prehistoric past. A past which likely contained an advanced civilization that predates all known advanced civilizations by thousands of years. The visual exploration of archeological sites is both enlightening and engaging. Adding in Graham Hancock's suggested rewrite of ancient history - which, after watching this series seems not just plausible but highly probable - makes this a series that is definitely worth the watch. I highly recommend it."
Ancient Apocalypse,Great show that challenges conventional theories about ancient civilizations,"After reading some of Hancock's books and listening to his interviews on the Joe Rogan podcast, I was really glad to hear about this show coming on Netflix.

Go listen to the interviews of him and Randall Carlson on JRE if you haven't yet. They're fascinating!

The theories presented in the series are very compelling and I'd love to hear what mainstream archaeologists have to say to refute them. I bet they would be hard-pressed to do so.

If only more archaeologists were as open-minded as Graham Hancock, we'd probably know a lot more about our past by now.

I'd really love to see a second season about psychedelics that Graham hinted about on JRE."
Ancient Apocalypse,Hardly 'controversial',Comentario no disponible
Ancient Apocalypse,Not for skeptical people,"This is the first time I ever write a review on IMDB. But I need to say something.

For those people that are saying he has no scientific facts or bases his findings on myths. Well, for one, there is little to no evidence (yet) that proves a forgotten civilisation before recorded history by the academia. The sites or findings that proves the academia wrong have been shut down. (You can search about these). The myths he chose to show might not be a common one in the country you live in, but not every myths got told to every single person in the generations. There are myths of our kings and queens, warriors and heroes that have been proven to be true in my country. These myths are all pointing us to Younger Dryas. And scientists are researching the evidence now, just like the evidence that give us conclusion to the ice age existance.

Since there are no evidence on how these buildings and pyramids are made, how human learned farming, don't you get curious of what the myths are telling us?? Don't you get confused of why shrines, temples, pyramids around the world are built with the same shape, worship the same god? Aren't you curious why shapes like the ones on Easter Island appears around the world when supposedly humans are hunter gatherers and had no intelligent? Yes these are myths, but they were also carved into walls and statues, and they tell us the same story. Aren't you curious why there are so many pharaohs that are counted as myths by the academia, but their face and names are carved into the very same wall with all those other ""real"" pharaoh?

He's not saying giants and serpents are real. He is saying the events in those stories are the same. Shouldn't we look into it? He hasn't made a conclusion yet, he's just saying these could be the case.

He is not forcing you to believe it, he is simply asking the question ""aren't you curious?"".

Also, about the astronomists. Ancient China has been using sun moon and stars to predict the future, weather, to develop war tactics for thousands of years. It's not a myth that ancient people worship the sky.

What he has lead us to is not a rabbit hole, but a small small part of the evidences that have emerged. I really hope he keeps researching and doing this series. Since there are not a lot of evidence yet, these ancient buildings and stories might be pointing us to the right direction."
Ancient Apocalypse,Bombastic doc with compelling content,"I was looking forward to this but I can honestly say that I'm a bit disappointed by the execution. Is this designed for the ""I'm a celebrity"" crowd? I would have preferred fewer sound effects and massive dins- it's like being at a radio 1xtra dance!

The content is interesting and compelling enough without it being edited to within an inch of its life.

I will watch the rest but it would have been much better to have it presented it in a less bombastic fashion, more straight forward

I believe I am being quite fair here. No doubt others will complete destroy it.

I believe I am being quite fair here. No doubt others will complete destroy it."
Ancient Apocalypse,Wild accusations with no real evidence,"In the first episode, old mate drills into a mountain, carbon dates some rock and decides there was a 20,000 year old civilisation there because the rock is 20,000 years old.

By the same technique, the driveway I had laid last week would have 100,000 year old sand stone in it, so it must have been laid by a civilisation 100,000 years ago.

The guys a quack and getting paid a lot to sell rubbish to misinformed everyday people.

Granted the visuals are beautiful, however the filming style and audio makes it seem like he's found something revolutionary. It's not revolutionary, it's science fiction.

1 star because I can't give 0."
Ancient Apocalypse,An engaging and mesmerizing series with Graham Hancock himself in the lead!,"I have read much of Hancock's work before, and I do consider myself somewhat of an admirer of his, but this, I must say, this was something I was not prepared for. Thank you sincerely. Thank you to the whole team and to everyone who is behind this gem of a production. It has been one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences in a long while for me. Having gotten fed up with many of Netflix's low-effort and rubbish documentaries lately, this one truly stuck out.

Not only is it straight to the point and doesn't at any point feel dragged out, but it also manages to do something most other series nowadays do not. It entices you, not by the use of cliffhangers or the like, but by simple, captivating storytelling. I find it astonishing how big of an impact a competent, fluent, and well-educated speaker can have on a show. It was a good decision by Netflix to have Graham do the voice-over and not hire someone else. His voice is the perfect mix of a fascination for the subject and an eagerness to teach, and it's so pleasant listening to.

The CGI work, the cinematography, the composition, and the timelines, everything matches together so beautifully. I especially liked the illustrations and drone shots taken from these amazing sites. It really gives you a better understanding of the perspective and true-scale of these stunning, extraordinary structures.

Sure it's been edited to create suspense, and the music is a bit dramatic at times, but in my opinion, this merely adds to the viewing experience as a whole. I mean, how cool is it not that ancient advanced civilizations might have existed a lot sooner than we had previously thought? Just the idea of it alone I find rather intriguing. It doesn't, however, take away from the fact that much of this is purely speculation, but, the possibility of it actually being true I think demands for these sites and locations be investigated further.

If you are a sucker for history, like me, and consider yourself a tinkerer, then this is the perfect show for you. I promise you, you'll be suprisingly pleased. And thank you, Graham, for letting me on this journey with you. I could only dream of one day getting to meet you, and perhaps venture these incredible locations for myself.

Much love, a youngling from Sweden."
Ancient Apocalypse,Old man needs new hobbies,"An old conspiracy theories believes he knows more than actual archaeologists and is so I'll researched that he can't even get basic dates for the sites he uses correctly. Netflix really just sunk their money into this oil spill of a ship for people to pretend they know what they're talking about.

How about making an actual documentary series with established real archaeologists who have actual credentials and experience instead of letting this wrinkled legume get off on his own ego and drag every pseudoscience loving freak with him. If you have an interest in history just do some research but don't take the steps back that watching this mess would take you."
Ancient Apocalypse,Entertaining yet educational. Great explanations of their foundings.,"Love documentaries like this with no definite closure and always ended with mysteries and our own intepretation. The host (Graham Hancock) did his part well and seems someone with tons of knowledge in lost histories, ancient civilization, cultures, geology, mathematics, science and etc. Great representation of various countries/borders/cultures/background/histories and very entertaining to watch yet very educational. The sound effects and visual effects were totally acceptable and easier to understand. The guests were all able to done their part well by giving a brief explanation of their own lifelong researches to the viewers with facts and hypothesis. Recommended."
Ancient Apocalypse,Archaeological Fantasy,"To quote the journal Economic Times: ""Scientists have categorized almost all of Hancock's ""scientific thesis"" as pseudoscientific, and archaeologists have termed his works ""examples of pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology."" Media sources suggest that none of Hancock's research articles was peer-reviewed."" The cinematography is beautiful but it's a shame that academically rigorous archaeologists were not featured. If they had been the public could learn something that is supported by evidence rather than be misled into believing a fantasy dreamed up by the narrator and promoted by Mr Rogan who loves a good story more than the messy and difficult truth."
Small Crimes,,
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Long in-depth interviews without the ad break,"I always enjoyed interesting guests in the various late shows having a bit more time to tell an interesting story. However, even if they had the full 10 minutes, you felt like you were missing out as they had to be cut off after one or two anecdotes. Additionally, the ad breaks always disrupted the flow of the conversation and even if you decided to catch up the day after on YouTube, you'd have to search for all the various clips in the correct order to have seen it all.

All of that is now gone. ""My next guest needs no introduction"" allows Letterman to do what he seemingly always wanted to do - just have an in-depth conversation with an interesting guest, but without any interruptions. You can tell he's enjoying this and he seems to be willing to make the most of this new format. In the first episode, we have already seen him put a lot of research into his guest, Barack Obama. Future episodes will show us whether Letterman will continue to put as much effort into his job as interviewer, but I have very high hopes and think this show will continue to be revealing and entertaining.

Overall, I quite enjoyed the first episode and I have very high hopes for the episodes to come."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Very interesting,Heart Warming interviews. Very interesting and surprising.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,It's not a late night talk show,"I've seen a lot of reviews stating that the show was not funny, not in the same vein as his talk show, etc.

This is not the late show with David letterman. This is not a show of him interviewing who ever the new hot star is promoting the new hot movie. This is Letterman interviewing people that he personally finds fascinating. This isn't a stand up routine or even a comedy. He's asking the deeper questions and giving them a platform to really speak without being edited by networks. He uses this show to give a look into the people themselves not just their new project. I personally have enjoyed the relaxed nature where he is able to bring out a side of the celebrities, and what they have experienced.

If your looking for the late show this is not it."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,I think people have the wrong idea...,"It seems too many are coming to this show expecting The Late Show part 2.

That is dumb. Yes, it's David Letterman. We all get that. But in no way has this show been promoted or promised anything of the sort. This is a serious, sit down interview with very important, very influential people on a variety of very important topics. Yeah, there are some funny things mixed throughout, but that's incidental.

This is not about you laughing or thinking it's the Netflix answer to late night. It isn't. This is astounding, honest interviews with people about inspirational and heartbreaking things. And it's utterly fantastic.

Quit thinking that Letterman is out for laughs here, he isn't. Watch it with no expectations, and I think you'll be in for a treat."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,The Longer Interviews You Wanted To See,"Sometimes Letterman had guests you wanted to see more of, rather than the 5 or 6 minutes they were allotted on his previous shows with CBS and NBC. Consider it done now with Dave's new Netflix show, ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction"".

Gone are (most) wise cracks and self deprecating humor Letterman was famous for on his late-night shows. There's no band, no lengthy witty monologue about current events, and really no set either. Filmed in a college auditorium in New York, the ""set"" is two leather chairs and a table sitting in the middle of a large stage. Lights, cameras and other technical equipment are sometimes seen in various shots throughout the program but that's the whole feel of the show; it's not an error and it fits nicely with the format.

We see a different Letterman here than the one we're used to. A white-bearded, easygoing fellow who appears to be a lot more chill and in his element. There's no pressure to keep people laughing and tuning in, and it shows on screen (that's not a bad thing). There's no hard-nosed journalism, thankfully. Consider it like this: two friends chatting about life, and you the viewer, are invited to listen in. Very personal questions, and very personal answers that are from the heart.

Letterman talks with the kind of guests you wish you saw more of when they were on his late-night shows. ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction"" (and yet he does introduce them) is nearly an hour long, broken up with brief produced segments to keep the flow going. You probably won't catch every episode; rather you'll want to see the ones with people you admire or those whom always have something interesting to say. And that's OK; that's just the kind of show it is. Personally, I tuned in to the first episode with Barack Obama (his first talk show appearance since leaving office), and I'll probably watch the next episode with George Clooney, where Letterman makes a surprise visit to the Clooney home. Unlike many Netflix shows the entire season has not been released all at once."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,I like what I've seen so far,"One of the most recognizable faces on TV for three decades, David Letterman has been continuing his career on Netflix with ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman"". Unlike his previous shows, this one is not a slapstick comedy opening with commentary about the day's events, transitioning into short interviews with the guests. We have here hour-long interviews. Most importantly, while the interviews take place in one location, the guests show Letterman things and people of significance to them. Barack Obama took him to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, while George Clooney took him to meet an Iraqi refugee. I'll be eager to see what Malala Yousafzai has to show him.

Don't get me wrong. Letterman still has a joke or two up his sleeve. It's just that here we get to see his human side as opposed to Dave the goof-off. With a thick beard, he seems worlds away from the man recognizable from late night TV. I hope to see the remainder of the show. It looks to be fun."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Brilliant,Maybe the best show Letterman have ever done. A rock solid start with Mr Obama. Well done Letterman and keep up the good work in the following episodes.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Lengthy discussions with interesting people in the public eye,I love the idea of a talk show revolving around natural conversation. The dialogue is interesting so I don't need the fireworks and insane showmanship to remain engaged which seems to be a big part of a lot of other shows. It has more of a talk radio feel and that leads to more in depth conversations which is missed now in the age of technology and short attention spans. Great variety of guests so far! :)
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,You May Like.,"I watched the obama episode, I expected it to be more fun, but it wasn't. It had a documentary-style content about the person's life, he was good at it."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Fantastic and educational,"I was looking for the next David Letterman show but what I got was so much more. Most of the guest are very informative and have taught me a lot, causing my to buy their books or whatever to learn more about them. The show is surprisingly emotional and might make you cry. People share their lives and the obstacles they've overcome with a positive message of how to help others. I didn't expect this and was pleasantly surprised.

Letterman is such a good interviewer, he lets the guest talk and doesn't interrupt them to share his own story or thoughts like Conan.

I really liked the people I didn't know anything about because I learned so much. The only bad one is Kayne. I like or liked him, I'm still not sure. But during the interview he is... well Kayne. He doesn't talk to David but instead the audience. And he doesn't really engage with a conversation. He has really lost his grip on reality and is lost in his celebrity world. He thinks his art can change the world and has lost sight of reality.

The Obama episode was great. Kinda bad to watch now in 2020 because it reminds me of how presidents should be. And how good we used to have it. I took this great man for granted at the time. I knew he was special but I didn't appreciate him how I should have. They're all really good and fascinating people. Tiffany Haddish was amazing and I had no idea who she was.

Thanks Dave for another great show."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,A FAR MORE RELAXED BUT ENGAGING FORMAT,"It should come as no surprise that this is Dave Letterman's element. A more or less free-form talk show. Unlike his more structured network shows, his personality comes through in more serious dialog and not just his signature humor. With a single guest, Dave has adopted a more conversational interview style. And the result is a more relaxed and engaging interview. Each interview is accompanied by related but much more personal clips than one expects from a typical talk show."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,It's all about David,David is so self indulgent in this show it's embarrassing. I have just watched four interviews and all he does is tell stories about himself and his son. He doesn't let the interviewee finish sentences. Doesn't ask any follow up or in depth questions and relies heavily on the fame of the guest to make a somewhat interesting show. It seems David has become a mediocre interviewer and should just leave the honor to himself and retire so we can remember him for the great man he is (was).
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Letterman the interviewer,"People have forgotten that David Letterman, behind the facade of the funny guy, always was a serious interviewer -perhaps not as punchy as Jon Stewart, but still pretty good. Always well prepared, knowing his facts, and having pointed questions. This new show is all about about having an in-depth conversation with the guest. Letterman did a pretty good job in the first episode. He was helped by the chart-topping quality of his first guest: Barack Obama. But if you listen carefully, the conversation was not random or free-flowing. It was carefully scripted, with civil rights and the Selma march -and the role of Congressman John Lewis- a central topic of discussion. Like a shadow commentary on current affairs -and the 45th President- without naming names or current events, only references to historical events that matter. This central piece was showcased within the context of pleasant and relaxed small talk and personal anecdotes, Letterman and Obama displayed a warm rapport, and the conversation was pleasant and interesting. This made the first episode very good viewing. I am concerned that guests in future episodes may not have equally compelling stories to tell. Hence the rating, as the interest of the show is dependent on the performance and personality of the guest, not Letterman. I anticipate I may watch some future episodes, but maybe not all."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,How Fantastic is Dave Really?,"Depending on your age, you may not know Dave's history as a comedian. Since he's been gone from late night TV, we get a sharper look at his genius and compelling talent through this series of Netflix shows. Every episode brings someone bigger than life and nearly an hour of their life story and/or accomplishments with Dave's one of a kind crafty wit drawing out the scenery in a way that makes one realize how spectacularly talented Letterman truly is, and how much he's missed. I found every guest at least a 10 for intriguing, with one exception, and Dave always a 10. This is a rare taste of post Late Night talent you really shouldn't miss. It's unlike what you might expect and more heartfelt than I can describe. I've watched the Obama episode 3 times and others twice. The Jay-Z episode didn't seem to connect like the others but I'd rate the other episodes high enough that the average would still be a 10. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this gem. See how you'd rate it. No doubt you'll enjoy though. This is the end of Season 1 with 7 episodes and I really hope there's another season planned!"
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,rich and rewarding,"David Letterman was and is a generational talent. As the era of the single late night host came to an end with Carson's retirement and Dave's subsequent departure from his network, he ushered in a change to the industry he was a leading voice of. Now, in the twilight of his career, Dave reveals what a singular talent he is by bringing something to entertainment that is simultaneously new and fresh and reminiscent of the past.

There have been, of course, numerous long-form deep dive interview shows throughout the years. And it's not uncommon for entertainers and newscasters who find themselves retired from their primary careers but with a lifetime of contacts and experience and the energy to use it, to start a slower-paced but more informative interview show. What's different here is that Dave conducts his interviews as almost a documentary that has been chopped down to something more condensed, something that is a representation of his mind and experiences from meeting people.

It isn't just about the subject of the interview or the interview itself. The show brings together cuts of Dave meeting people in their homes, in their parents homes, at their workplaces, etc., and splices it together with Dave exploring the environment around his guests, Dave warming his audience with teasers about the guest, and the interview itself. It's all mixed together with an internal logic that comes from his mind; a reflection of his personality, his sharp comedic wit, and how he sees his guest in a larger context.

Interview questions might seem bizarre and nonsensical, such as asking what his guest had for breakfast, only to lead to a deeper discussion about the medications that person takes and the conditions surrounding it. Or he might ask a young woman about school and going to classes and school games that sounds like a conversation you might have with your grandfather, only to have that merge with a discussion of a traumatic event on a school bus earlier in her life. And you begin to see this logic emerging about how Dave himself sees this person: as a young woman full of potential and intellect and passion who survived this horrific ordeal that he would almost rather not think about, but does because he's amazed at her perseverance and her resemblance to other young woman her age.

Interview questions can jump topics abruptly or include a short monologue about himself or seamlessly drift in and out of previous footage so that you have to pay attention to the broader logical thread, because you are inside his mind now. The logic is his logic and you are only along for the ride. It is an old master's prerogative: he isn't selling you anything, he is letting you tag along and he hopes you will enjoy the experience but he will not coddle you.

And the guests all seem to get this, even the truly powerful and successful ones. They let him steer the ship because they sense that being there is as much their privilege as having them is his. Dave sporting an insane Methuselah beard, wearing comfortable clothes, and asking inane and sometimes even lightly mocking questions is still Dave. Poor health and a different technological and entertainment landscape robbed the previous generation of Carson's graceful bow, but we are fortunate enough to get Letterman.

So yah, it's a rich and rewarding show and well worth watching. It won't spoon feed the interview the way late night television interviews have to, but you'll get an experience with one of televisions most complex, fascinating, and flawed personalities and a once in a generation talent."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Pleasantly suprised.,"These interviews really show the human side of these celebrities. Only someone with David Letterman's reputation and the respect people feel for him, could bring out the warmth. I was a huge fan of James Lipton and was pleasantly surprised to enjoy these interviews."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Very easy going and chill format, enjoyed it a lot","This is not a late night show like he used to do, the format is more relaxed and open. David has still got it, and its not just about comedy its beyond that.

Loved the episodes with Obama, Clooney and Shah Rukh Khan."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,It's an opened door chit chat...,"This show is beautiful, that's a simple, but on point word for this show.

It's not your typical late show in cable, i don't even think it's a late show. There's not a real format, but it's more like David invites friend, who is also a celebrity of course, and has with them a normal conversation: work, like, passions, future, past. And we can watch that chatting between the two and although not really part of it physically, you get involved since it's such an intimate spot.

If you like David Letterman this is just more of his brilliant, fluent, smart mind. Actually, it's just that, a dark spot enlightened by him and his guests."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"FU to THE "" critics""",This is not the late show...part 2 The show is like a formal podcast with an audience where Dave has an honest human to human conversation with moments of humor in it ( you know like normal conversation have) Giving you greater insight to the individual he's interviewing. ITS a brilliant show and I can't wait for season 3 especially Dave Chappelles episode
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,So many good guests but stop interrupting,Letterman has so many good guests on his show but I wish he would stop interrupting them with his stories. I'd not want to hear home talk I want to hear the guests.
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,This is not any-other show !,Cheerful ! Heart touching ! Very pleasant ! Very uplifting and inspiring .
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Dave was and still is the best. Great series.,"Such a great interview/talk show. It's so good to see Dave back doing what he does best. His ability to use humor and honesty to put people at ease is delightful and engaging. He can take the most uptight, self-obsessed celebrity and almost immediately bring them down to earth with the rest of us. Dave has aged beautifully. Highly-recommended show. 👍🏼💯"
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,If you gave it a 7 or lower your a trump supporter,"It is obvious the haters that rate this are Republicans, Gang members of a Gang that is a dying party! The Republican ship is sinking so are the Democrats! Financial Oligarchy is the reason of thier destruction and David Letterman just proves it with his interviews indirectly! People speaking honestly proves what America really wants not what the Politcal Parties want you to want. This show is so amazing I found myself laughing so hard, David Letterman should run as a Independant President of the United States! That or Elyn Degenrous. I am invested emotionally on this show and I hope they have 10 more seasons of this show because there are so many influential people that needs to be interviewed openly. It proves we dont need music or branding of a product or a bunch of fake laughs to get people to watch! Netflix is not about that they are about documentaries and having there own unique programs and selling thier monthly subscriptions! I love Netflix! If PBS ever collapsed due to finance I hope Netflix will buy it out and keep it going forever. Thank you David Letterman for coming out of retirement and have my mind working again! My brain is on fire! I cant believe how you influenced me so much now I need to put those thoughts into action."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,Real Uplifting Conversations,"This is one of my favorite pieces of art I've watched. It's so real. It's David letterman having a real conversation about someone's life with the people that interest him, and me/others, the most. There are scenes filmed with their families/coworkers that are inserted into the interview that teach you more about the person. No episode feels like an interview. All of them are a peer having a conversation about their life and how they have changed the world. I would say there is no ego, but they are all famous and have their own platforms, but it doesn't feel pretentious. Everyone seems grateful for their current position and it's always guests that are doing great things for the greater world. I usually watch one at a time maybe after the news or late at night but it always feels uplifting and there are a lot of laughs throughout the reality. Simply amazing. I'm very glad this series is out in the world. Thank you to David Letterman and all his guests for the positive energy this series exudes."
My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman,"Intimate, insightful, and very entertaining.","While it doesn't contain a lot of the trademark craziness of Letterman's older talk shows, My Next Guest functions well as an insightful and interesting series. His interviews with Obama, George Clooney, and Howard Stern in particular are among my favorites. Combine that with a great score by Paul Shaffer, My Next Guest is definitely a Netflix original worth checking out."

Dear My Friends,Today is the youngest you will ever be,The series is about a group of long term friends and relatives who are in the winter of their lives and facing the issues that come with age. Wan is a writer and the daughter of one of them and her mother try's to persuade her to write a book about them and their lives. Wan is reticent at first as she always feels put out by the demands of them but will she eventually be persuaded. ? A delightful well acted and directed series which looks as how old people are viewed and how we should never judge others without looking at what they have faced in life.
Dear My Friends,Delightful! Great performances by all!,What a wonderfully delightful series! Each one of these veteran actors threw out all the stops and gave top notch performances. They touched on every topic that people face in their lives especially as they enter their twilight years. I didn't want it to end!!!
Dear My Friends,nothing like it,"This is such a wonderful series with these special elder Korean actors, the story is well written and these women are Korean Gems, funny and touching, well done"
Dear My Friends,Walking down memory lane,These A list actors are rally taking me back to when I actually used to watch Korean drama as a kid. Stellar performance by all. The cameos are spectacular as well.
Dear My Friends,One of my favorite Kdrama,"I loved it. It's a real life story. Funny, touchy and exciting.

Great story with perfect performances. Thanks for this remarkable Kdrama."
Dear My Friends,A gallery of stars!,"Outstanding performances! I'm giving it a 10/10 because of the out-of-this-world-performances of the casts. Great to see South Korean film veterans show how to shine in a movie screen. Each one of them gives a stunning interpretation of their role. This drama is a tribute to these excellent actors and actresses. They are all marvellous! Not to forget of course these three from younger generation, Go Hyun-jung, Lee Kwang-soo and Jo In-sung. You can't resist falling in love with them. These two actors, LKS and JIS may have few scenes in this drama, but they are just incredible with giving justice to their respective roles. LKS is so good as the caring son. I am amaze too with JIS «silent acting» as a disabled man who is loyally in love with the woman of his life. His timid smile and his soulful eyes, as Yeon-ha, give me the constant urge to give him a warm hug.

To the director... you have done a great job showing us the best of these wonderful artists! Thank you!

Hats off to all of you!!!"
Dear My Friends,"Beautiful, sentimental",Could there have been a better drama? I don't think so. This is one of my favourite kdramas. And can I just say I'm kinda happy and proud that I watched it before I knew that Namjoon recommended it?

The Invitation,Go in Blind - Don't Watch the Trailer or Read the Reviews,Comentario no disponible
The Invitation,Table manners are deadly,It's really a film about how social expectations can confine and prevent you from calling out weird and creepy behavior for fear of being rude.
The Invitation,The Invitation incites audiences to attend the most anxiety-inducing dinner party ever.,"Grief. The melancholic turmoil of loss. A catalyst for unwanted prominent personality alterations that change the very fabric of who we are. Each individual experiences sorrow and subsists through a variety of different methods. Some forgive and forget. Others harness the inability to progress, experiencing a stumbling block of anguish as they continually inflict psychological suffering upon themselves. It is irrefutably the most difficult emotion to overcome, and can overwhelm the strongest of personalities. Kusama's thrilling episode of 'Come Dine With Me' gradually explores the weight of life itself, simply by allowing a group of long-time friends the chance to discuss such a topic. Yet, what enables Kusama's slow-burn thriller to elevate itself into the top echelon of effective profoundness, is its simplicity.

There are no extravagant plot devices. No sublimely utilised twists. And certainly no misplaced character conveniences. By equipping grief and depression as a manifestation of the narrative, Kusama was able to demonstrate her incredibly astute direction through natural plausibilities. Will, portrayed accurately and captivatingly by Marshall-Green, exhumed indications of paranoia. A heightened consequence of his raging anguish. Constantly questioning the actions of other characters, such as locked doors, barred windows and unknown guests, he assumes the role of the audience's perception. We, as the viewer, examine and query each character reveal and emotional complexity simultaneously to Will's interrogative persona. He, essentially, is us. Instantly allowing viewers to relate to him in this unusual circumstance.

Something is not right with this dinner party. He feels it. We feel it. But his instincts are muted by the other guests, naturally due to his heightened state of sorrow, in order to maintain a civilised appearance. That, right there, is the representation of depression. Forced to hide what we really are enduring, with despondent thoughts circling our synapses. It's abundantly intelligent on Kusama's part, who elevated the screenplay to the stratosphere of uneasy, anxiety-inducing storytelling. With the assistance of Shore's cinematography, constantly blurring the outskirts and backgrounds of frames to enhance personable abandonment and solitude, Kusama hosted one of the most engaging dinner parties I've ever attended. Inviting a naturally diverse cast of actors, ranging from different ethnicities to sexual orientation, who inhibit their own character qualities.

An array of components culminating in a third act that switches from first gear to a gear with incalculable speeds. The wine was served, my heart rate increased. I required a towel, I was sweating that much from anxiety. Ignoring the last minute of the feature, which was an eye-rolling moment to say the least, a slow-burn thriller such as this utilises a substantial amount of foreshadowing as its narrative device. Unfortunately, it is inescapable. However, Hay and Manfredi do their utmost best to keep the conversation flowing during times of prognostication. Shapiro's score is also worth mentioning for its sharp string-based chords that increase the chance of sweaty palms.

The Invitation, from the offset, is an incredibly simple thriller. Games are played, wine is served and a few arguments are bound to occur. However, if you cut through Kusama's simplistic exterior, you'll find an extraordinarily intelligent dinner party that evokes a powerful emotional connection. Just, y'know, think twice before accepting an invitation..."
The Invitation,"Good in the genre, but not great.","The build up and suspence was great, you can clearly feel the 'Coherence' vibes, but cliche outcome without any real resolution to the drama makes the whole thing so painfully superficial."
The Invitation,An intense experience,"A powerful feature film. Despite some reminiscence (group of friends, dinner, the house atmosphere, colors) with ""Coherence"" is undoubtedly an original movie. A very interesting point made by the director (who had already done Girlfight and Jennifer's Body) over a possible processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. A lot of tension, making us doubt who you believe (or even what is real) at every step, until the crux of the matter comes; you may wait a little for that, but it's worth it. Point for the director for not using low blows. Worthwhile if you want to spend a very intense time. With regards to actors' work, ""Will"" comes out unscathed. ""Eden"" maybe a little artificial, but I think it is an intentional nuance given by the director. The rest comes off well. The screenplay is pretty good. Although it is not revolutionary, the pace is accurate, keeps the suspense, and plays with ambiguity."
The Invitation,Let me save you ninety minutes of your life...,"Fast forward this film and just watch the last ten minutes. You'll be able to have a conversation with anyone who watched this and they won't be able to detect that you skipped ninety percent of it. Don't send a thank you card, this is a public service."

The Invitation,This one blew me away!,"So I watched this movie, already kinda knowing the feel of the story but wasn't too sure of the premise. But as time progressed, it became crystal clear where this movie was going. This is the kinda of movie that really have you think that people are people, are not people, but live very dark lives, and that, nothing is as it seems. This one blew me away. Even after realizing what this film was about, I was still taken aback of how the story unfolded. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. For mature audiences only. Overall I love it, story, characters, even the ending took me by surprise. This is a conversation movie, you know, the kind you talk about after leaving the theater. I'll watch again, this time with friends."
The Invitation,An Intoxicating Thriller. Incredible.,Comentario no disponible
The Invitation,Slow but great,I've read a few reviews here both for and against the film. I'm a die hard thriller fan and I thought that this film was very well done. It is slow- but why is that a bad thing?- I'm not sure. It builds to a great ending. My only meh is the actress who plays Eden. I think they could have cast her better. Other than that I'll say worth the watch if you like thrillers.
The Invitation,wasted potential,"I don´t mind the slow build-up, I think it´s justified, kind of like the calm before the storm. The problem is how much of it is wasted. We focus on the main character´s grief, which in the end isn´t that important, while the other characters are completely ignored. One tiny conversation with each one of them, that´s all we know. The girlfriend Kira literally disappears for an hour. It often feels like Will is all by himself in that house. Suspicion gets bigger but none of the guests seem to care about anything. There are some small comments, of course, but we have 5 or 6 characters devoid of any personality or will. I feel like some events could have been much stronger if those characters weren´t merely filling the space.

There are some fine things, though, I´d never wanted to punch John Carroll Lynch so hard in the face. The same goes for Lindsay Burdge."
The Invitation,Rare great ending to a horror thriller!! Awesome!!,"It's very rare lately that a thriller movie has a great ending but this movie has a great 1!! Excellent cast and excellent story it's slow button but interesting and you'll love the ending, a must see thriller!!!,"

The Invitation,Absolutely worth watching. But...,Comentario no disponible
The Invitation,"Dizzying, suspenseful, thought provoking","THE INVITATION is a tense, engaging film that seems far shorter than its 100-minute running time. After seeing ÆON FLUX, I was predisposed to watch another film directed by Karyn Kusama, and I wasn't disappointed. With THE INVITATION, she has directed a dizzying, psychological drama that is both suspenseful and thought provoking.

The disturbing atmosphere and pervasive sense of dread that are hallmarks of THE INVITATION are established early on. Will and Kira have received a formal invitation to a party at the home Will and his ex-wife formerly shared, and out of a sense of social obligation, they are attending. On the way, Will hits a coyote and has to euthanize it with a tire iron. His revulsion is a revealing introduction to his character and a heck of a way to start both a movie and an evening out. What follows is a deeply uncomfortable study in going along to get along that the viewer knows will have to end poorly.

The principal actors all proffer good performances, especially Logan Marshall-Green, who does outstanding work in the lead role. Michiel Hulsman and Tammy Blanchard, both sporting the look of crazy, expertly ramp up the ick factor as ex-wife/paramour and cult recruiters. Also noteworthy: Lindsay Burdge and John Carroll Lynch as malevolent whack jobs are slightly over the top, but they do a superb job of making you hate both their characters and cults in general, which is their raison d'etre.

While the entire cast's acting is never worse than competent, the top of the bill still compensates for lesser performances. A few of the characters have so little to do that they might as well have been absent. They're cardboard cutouts that are barely needed, even to move the narrative along. It's a flaw, but as flaws go, a minor one that doesn't confuse the story.

The plot doesn't offer many surprises; as viewers, we're kept fully informed from the beginning. When Will and Kira enter the beautiful house overlooking downtown Los Angeles, nothing feels right. When their hosts lock themselves and their guests inside with the explanation that there have been recent home invasions, we know it's creepy. The screening of a video with obvious cult overtones and an awkward ""truth game"" rife with overt sexual come-ons continue to ramp up the tension. As a result, Will's anxiety grows, and ours grows along with it, and while other guests dismiss Will's apprehension as the emotional machinations of a grieving father, we know something bad is going to happen.

THE INVITATION also is not without its messages, exploring societal issues Americans have been grappling with in earnest for about a decade. Is the claim of ""offense"" by social bullies such an overwhelming power play that people will ignore their fight or flight instincts rather than be perceived as giving it? Is the need for peer approval so strong that we will set aside our own sensitivities and allow ourselves to be coerced into compliance? Is groupthink so potent that it can compel us to act against our own better judgment and best interests, even to the point of self harm? These questions are never fully answered, but the implications are worrisome.

As Kusama continues to turn the screw and the plot lurches toward it's inevitable conclusion, we are confronted with a final twist that, while unexpected, is not particularly original. Nevertheless, loose ends are mostly tied up and you won't feel cheated, even though you'll likely have a sense all along of where the whole affair is heading.

Ultimately, THE INVITATION is an entertaining movie that, while imperfect, is a solid effort and a fine vehicle for escaping a crappy week at work. Enjoy it.

I insist."
The Invitation,"Incredibly tense, oddly realistic","I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the score for this film. It doesn't do it any justice, and some of the reviews I've read here don't make valid points in my opinion. So, I felt I owed this film my own review.

First of all, the tension: man this thing has a killer build-up! You could call it slow (if you're a Transformers kind of guy), but it never gets ""boring"". You're on the edge of your seat from the moment the film starts, partly due to a very subtle but creepy soundtrack, which reminded me of sound effects in some of David Lynch's movies. Adding to that is the fantastic performance of Logan Marshall-Green as the tormented Will. He, and the events that follow, will keep you guessing about his mental health and whether his paranoia is justified or not, almost until the end. Michiel Huisman plays the very smooth and lulling host to great effect, and the rest of the group of friends is also very believable and natural.

THE scene (no spoilers, you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it!) was so well done I really had the feeling I was there. It all happens so slow, so eerily apropos, and so jaw-droppingly unexpected that you really get the feeling of ""oh my, that could be me out there"". The little twist in the last couple of minutes is the cherry on the cake, and makes you even more uncomfortable than you already were.

This is a case of an ""ignore the scores, just watch it already!"" film, and I hope you enjoy it every bit as much as I did!"
The Invitation,"A non-traditional, low gore low jump scare flick. Haunting in its own right without making the audience plug their ears in anticipation.","Director Karyn Kusama speaks volumes in what appears to be the slowest story I have ever seen. I didn't realize until Act 3, but the slow and personal story being told has a purpose. Logan Marshall-Green's performance was convincing, and ultimately caused me to be lulled into an incorrect prediction of the final act. This is a horror film with no jump scares or horrifying imagery, so not a terrible one to pull out with a queasy friend!"

The Invitation,A thriller for people who don't watch horror films,"I'm not going to give a review of this film. I'll leave that to others who can argue whether it was worth watch or not. For me, I feel it was one of the best thrillers with a horror bent that I have seen in a long while. But here's the thing, I don't really like horror films, avoid them most of the time, unless I heard a good word of mouth from someone. That's how I found The Invitation.

After reading the reviews here, I would say the criticism falls in to two opposing camps. Those that thought it was thrilling, terrifying and well done movie and those who thought it was a waste of their time, slow and they saw all the punches coming.

I think the difference is this, the latter camp watches a lot of horror films, nothing surprises them, they are looking for all the little nuances of all the other horror movies they have watched and are comparing them to the film they are currently watching. They are two - three steps ahead of a conventional audience and thus, nothing surprises them. To these folks, I can understand why the film fell flat, it's clear if you put the movie under a microscope you can tell what's going to happen and naturally with the purposefully drawn out pace of this film, they get bored waiting for the payoff.

I, as well as the people who I have give / shown this film to, fall in to the other camp. We rarely watch films like this and therefore are willing to let it all play out without trying the guess what's going to happen next. It's certainly a creepy film and while we might imagine where it's going, we are willing to suspend our expectations and go along for the ride.

My advice, watch this if you enjoy the ride up on the climbing roller coaster without thinking about the plunge when you reach the top."

The Invitation,I'm not feeling it,"This film tells the story of a couple who is invited to a dinner party at a friend's place. They arrive, expecting a reunion of friends, only to find awkward and strange events in the party.

The social interaction in the party is certainly very awkward, and the awkwardness lasts for far too long for me to enjoy the film. After an hour into the story, finally there's something to see. Unfortunately the events happen fast and in darkness, there are times when  I can hardly figure out what is happening. This is a pity, as the story could have been thrilling and mysterious. It seems many people like this film, but I'm not feeling it."

In the meantime his younger brother is with the wrong guys in debt because of his compulsive gambling. The thrird brother has the down-syndrome and is about to be sent to a public facility. Bow it's on to the oldest one to pay the debts of his brother and to prevent the relocation of his other brother. This means that he has to get involved again in the criminal life. An authentic insight into the struggle of the socially disantvantaged. Like a German version of ""La haine"". One big plus is also the great soundtrack."

Second and third generation Gastarbeiter. Hopeless, without any chance to ever make it out. Torn between tradition, family and society. I have never seen anything so intensively portraying the pain and motivations of male people in that group. It is pain to watch. Yes, there are better motion pictures.

Key characters and every acting performance is very realistic and this makes movie more real. Actually best key feature is reality for a drama and this movie make this in every second."
Castle and Castle,Really enjoyed this show!,"Castle is about a famous novelist named Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion) as he teams with NYPD detective Kate Beckett (Stana Katic) to solve mureders. As they investigate these murders they build a strong relationship both at work and in their private lives. Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic just have such great chemistry...at least on screen, off not so much. They apparently did not get along in real life and that was a big reason the show stopped after 8 great seasons. Those two are definitely the best thing about the show but not the only thing. The rest of the supporting cast all pull their own weight too. Each of them is what makes this show so special, there's not a weak link among them. This is a show where you can watch it more than once and still not be bored."
Castle and Castle,Miss It!,"Castle is still one of my favorite police procedural shows today and God knows there are plenty to choose from. It has a perfect blend of comedy, action and drama! It's just a flat out fun show! Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are both perfect as Richard Castle and Kate Beckett!"
Castle and Castle,Excellent start!,"I fully enjoyed the pilot episode of Castle. Nathan and Stana have great chemistry, with him providing a ton of comedy as the crime fiction author to her straight laced cop. Castle is an engaging hero with a surprising amount of support from the characters around him, especially with his daughter and his mother.

I find the premise has tons of promise as the series progresses, both with the types of plots that can come from Castle's novels and with his romantic interests. The idea that a series of murders can be copied into real life seems a bit trite, but the execution was far better than I expected. The fact that Castle can keep up with Detective Beckett as far as crime scene analysis and motives is smart, but also a great source of comedy. Beckett's apparent infatuation with Castle's book series not only suggest that she's a potential love interest, but hints at a lot of character subtlety that has yet to come.

If crime drama crosses with romantic comedy sounds at all for you, then you should definitely watch and support Castle."
Castle and Castle,"Ah, a Breath of Fresh Air.","The pilot episode for ABC's new crime show ""Castle"" left me wanting more, much more in fact, and that is exactly what a good pilot should do. The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.

I'll start with Nathan Fillion(of ""Firefly"" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is ""72%"" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in ""Firefly""(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).

Then there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a cliché tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).

What it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.

Before I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene. I hope the producers arrange for more cameos of this nature.

Done."

Castle and Castle,Let's be fair...,"Yes, this is a great vehicle for Nathan Fillion because he's gets to play the lovable scoundrel, which truly is his bread and butter. I was worried when I saw the pilot that they were going to shoot their premise in the foot but was impressed at the end when they gave you a new basis that could last longer than a few episodes. Now if we're fair and judge this show on it's writing and acting rather than on our excitement that Nathan Fillion is back then we must conclude... that the show is still pretty good. I have been impressed with the story lines up to this point and while the short description of the ""who-dun-it"" may sound like scenarios we've heard before, these writers aren't satisfied with a ""Law and Order"" ending. They've already thrown out the triple and quadruple switchbacks with the uncovering of the culprits. And all the while allowing Nathan Fillion to fill the screen with his smarmy charm and allowing him to cavort with an attractive, albeit, hard-boiled female cop.

The great part about this show is that they haven't really set up Fillion as a Sherlock Holmes. He is playing a seemingly educated street-wise poetic guy, but he isn't the one with all the answers. For every conclusion he draws, the female lead makes just as many and may refine Fillion's, which is wise on the writers' part because his character works because of the inherent flaws that come with being a writer rather than a detective.

It's a clever show that's a must-see if you're a Fillion-atic and a pretty good hour even if you're not."
Castle and Castle,"Creative, Witty, and Nathan Fillion","I just finished watching the first showing and I am very pleased. Others and I have been starving for more Nathan Fillion ever since Firefly. It seems he has finally landed a lead role, which he has so definitely earned, in an interesting looking series. At this juncture, I don't have many predictions for the series which is a rarity these days and I think that it will be fun watching Castle and detective Beckett's relationship grow. The writing was quite creative even though it sometimes felt like they were rushing things. I think its possible that they could have made this first episode last another week or two, however, at the same time, its fast pace leaves no time wasted. I found myself sprinting into the kitchen for munchies and racing back in hopes of not missing any of the action. I will definitely be watching this next week :)"
Castle and Castle,A writer's show.,"I wish IMDb had a decimal system because this show isn't an 8. From what I saw in the Pilot it is a solid 8.5 at the very least. Tho the pilot was fairly predictable when it comes to crime shows that aren't CSI or Law and Order (i.e. one character is a fan of the other. Half way through everything is wrapped up a little too neatly etcetera), it was still an enjoyable romp.

Kate Beckett is a beautiful, hard nosed cop that should be working for a private law firm and Nick Castle is an arrogant, but devoted author and father.

Stana Katic (awesome name) is beautiful, but not so much that you wonder why she is a cop and not some goddess on an Italian beach like so many actresses tend to be. She plays her part very well, and the scene she has with Fillon when he, as Castle is peeling away her layers is amazing. She barely gives anything away until the very last moment, but with her facial expressions you know it's coming making her character all the more wonderful.

Nathan Fillion is wonderful as the successful, charismatic, and egocentric Pop mystery writer who seems to be not a drunk (unlike Hank Moody, played wonderfully by David Duchovney in Californication) and is a loving, attentive father apparently who also has an intriguing backstory with his publisher/ex-wife which I hope is a back story they continue to develop throughout the series.

This really was a fun series. I know new shows have a very short lifespan, but this is one I hope has a decent shelf life. Watching just the pilot I see the potential for great stories, for great ad-libs and i do want to see the happy ending where the jaded, divorced writer and the hard nosed cop with a history work to deconstruct each episodes mystery, and each other. And as would be when the characters have bared all they can, they either finally get into bed together, or they get married:)"

Castle and Castle,Nathan is in his element!!!,"For anyone of the ""Firefly"" persuasion, you are in for a treat! ABC realized what a gem they had in Nathan Fillion when he did his guest stint on Desperate Housewives, and they quickly got their act together and gave him a series! In other words, Nathan is back!! :) This series has a great start to it, with a strong ensemble cast that brings out a great multi-dimensional quality to the show. It is clever, and sarcastic humor reigns. The plot of the pilot was your typical Crime Investigation approach, but it is the delivery of this fine cast that breaks it apart from other shows. With that being said, I hope that they do develop the story lines a bit better in the future, but no matter what happens, this show is a joy to watch simply because of the cast...especially Nathan Fillion. This character is very much like Mal Reynolds in Firefly, and that is what brought me to this show. The rest of the cast and the great delivery is what will keep me with this show!! Well done ABC!!"

Castle and Castle,"Hook, line and sinker","As a dedicated Nathan Fillion fan I had to watch this show to support my favorite actor, but a few minutes into the pilot I knew I was in. Not only was Fillion perfect for his role as Rick Castle, but the rest of the cast fits together like a strange, yet very close family. By the end of the episode I was hooked. This show has it all, mystery, intrigue, comedy and relationships, beyond romance. It is relieving to have a show that is not only about the two main characters relationship, but also the daughter and mother and their corky relation to Castle. This show is a perfect ten! Here's hoping it has a longer run than Fillion's other work!!!"

Castle and Castle,Great Show,"This is the best new show this season! I enjoy the Mentalist but Castle is even better. The chemistry between Castle and Beckett is off the charts. I love it. This is coming from a die-hard CSI: Miami fan. CSI: Miami has lost its way showing the same boring story lines and turning into a soap opera. Castle is funny, serious, and smart all rolled into one. Please ABC bring this show back for another season. It will break my heart if they do not. I e-mailed ABC with my opinion so hopefully that will help. I already pre-ordered season one on DVD so that shows how much I love this show. I was never a fan of Nathon Fillion before but I am now. I even went out and bought Waitress just I could watch him. Is it Monday yet?"
Castle and Castle,"Fillion is ""King"" Of This CASTLE...","Oh, yeah, we've seen this one before....Irresistible-force-meets-immovable object. Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural.

CASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the ""charming rascal"" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)

But he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways.

A serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!

At first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast.

But creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players. Here these come in the form of Rick Castle's teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), whom of course is the real 'adult' in their relationship - probably her way of rebelling against her lovable father who nevertheless lives the lifestyle of a guy half his age, and their temporary roommate who also happens to be his mother, former stage and screen star Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan in a turn that makes Shirley MacLaine in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE look like a dowdy matron). Once you meet Martha, suddenly Rick's personality makes perfect sense.

As with any new series, this one will take some time to really settle into the groove it needs to capture a wider audience, but with the growing ease of the push-and-pull relationship between Fillion and Katic's characters, it could very well become the next ""MOONLIGHTING"" or ""REMINGTON STEELE""...which wouldn't be a bad thing. Crime procedurals have been missing that fun element of late, and CASTLE could very well bring it back, without having to resort to a less-successful springboard of surrealism to build from (sorry, LIFE ON MARS)."
Castle and Castle,This is a really entertaining show,"Despite the ordinary cop story, it's insane how good this show is. You won't find anything you haven't watched in a million crime shows before. Absolutely nothing. What really makes this show good is the acting, every single actor is outstanding."
Castle and Castle,"Every writer needs inspiration, and I found mine.","Castle is and will be one of my favorite crime shows. It differs from the usual ones with being original, funny and simply awesome. The cases are unique and well-written. It has a perfect blend of comedy, action and drama! All the characters are done well. Not to mention Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic are both perfect as Richard Castle and Kate Beckett! Their chemistry is to die for, from the first pilot episode. Their developing relationship and later on love story is one of the things I fell in love with the show. The way they look each other without having to say anything is just brilliant (especially in season 3&4 - is just wow ). Their love story is not only healthy but legendary. Yes, they have their issues as any couple but work it out, and they support each other perfectly. And one of the best couples on tv shows for sure. I adore the character growth, especially with Castle, and how he changed for Kate. And you can see how Castle changed her, too. They completed each other's and made lives extraordinary. Just as this show does for its viewers. I definitely recommend, you won't regret watching Castle. I will be rewatching it over and over again."
Castle and Castle,"Great pilot, then mostly okay until it gets boring and repetitive","This show is watchable. This is, for the most part, harmless family fun. If you have nothing else to do, this is a show you can always put on and be decently entertained by for a while.

Sadly they dragged things out for too long. As with most of these shows of similar premiss, they have material for 2-3 seasons and after that things go on repeat and everything starts to become very cliche. I also think they wasted Nathan Fillion's character a bit. In the first episode he is suave, rich playboy, careless and cool. He starts out as a fun male character. However as the show progress he becomes a source of jokes and weird theories and turns into a kinda lame character. There are exceptions as with his daughters kidnapping, but in general the character we see in the pilot is not the character we later get in the show - which I think is a shame.

As already mention the quality goes down with time, and although the show never stops being watchable, the cliche stories and repeating stories, almost make it a chore to watch and in the last season even boring.

Despite my small complaint about the titular character above, it is the characters that drive this show and make it entertaining. All the actors do a great job. This is mostly loveable fun and you can do a lot worse, but don't expect any amazing greatness.

A 6/10 and I recommend."
Castle and Castle,Good Dynamic between the characters,"While the plots may be a bit contrived, the main effort is the dialog and tension between the two main characters, i.e. the Writer and the Detective. This is a reminder of Gable and Russel, or any number of 1930's great couples in the movies when the lack of color images was lacking but the colorful dialog was what made the movies worth watching. It's called Chemistry and these characters are definitely full of it.

Now this week with Beckett turning the tables on Castle we are beginning a turn in the energy dynamic. Can't wait to see where the writers go with this one"
Castle and Castle,"Attractive and charming series with a splendid chemical between two protagonists : Nathan Fillon, and Stana Katic","Nice and overlong series created by Andrew W.

Castle and Castle,Great Show,"CASTLE is one of the best TV shows among the few shows I have ever seen. I started watching it because of Nathan Fillion.

I know him from the show ""FIREFLY"" and the movie ""SERENITY"" and he has done a great job in this too.

This show is different from other crime shows.

The chemistry between the lead characters is awesome. Story of most episodes is cheesy but its still fun because all the actors have done a great job.

Nathan Fillion looks a little old in season 2, I don't know why.

He should work out a little for the next season. I recommend it to anyone who don't like to get bored watching a show."
Castle and Castle,The change in Beckett character ruined the show,"I don't think they should've gotten Castle and Beckett together. I get it's what fans wanted but it ruined the show for me. Beckett became this hypocrite that it's okay she lies and is mean to Castle at her convenience but if he innocently kept things from her or to protect her, it's a major ordeal. Besides what is the deal with her having to look like a model all the time later on - have the perfect tan and hair done, etc. She just became this self righteous, arrogant snob. I have a hard time watching her character with seeing her be a softy with Castle then her obsession in deception ruining relationships. He should've let her go and do her own thing and move on. He didn't need her. The show would've been successful whomever they paired with Castle. It was nice to see him stop being such ac playboy, but Beckett just became annoying to me and not a good match for Castle. It would have been nice to kill her off and start with a new experience with him and his detective agency. Castle is definitely the reason to watch and how he played off the characters, always fun and enjoyable to watch!"
Ghost Stories,Watch the dub for the love of God,"This anime is a typical Ghostbusters/Scooby Doo anime by itself. I don't see why it's so highly lauded when the storyline is not that compelling. It's the dub that truly makes it worth watching. I can't describe how hilarious the dub is, only that they chose well when they decided to shred the script and go with their own thing. It was an experiment that paid off immensely because I was laughing every episode. The episodes themselves seemed to go by so quickly, I was having such a good time.

Don't bother with the Japanese subs for the ""real experience"", just watch another ghost story anime instead. Watch this dub because you need this hilarity in your life."
Ghost Stories,"Game over, man",Ghost Stories is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. It's also one of the worst shows ever made. It's hard to explain.
Ghost Stories,The funniest dub ever made,"First off: WATCH. THE. DUB. I'm serious. The subbed versus dubbed versions is probably the biggest difference from the two I've ever seen from any piece of fiction ever made. It changes the characters personality, the plot, and even the whole genre, but we'll get to that.

Let's start off with the subbed version. Uuuuh. How do I put it? Boring, generic, cliché, barely bearable characters, uninspired plot... For me, it would be a low 5/10 tends to 4. It's made to be ooooooo scary, but it's barely spoopy. It also has some creatures literally ported from other movies and horror stories (I recall seeing something similar to the ring), and yeah. I think you get the idea. If it doesn't get a one, it's solely because it didn't ""hurt"" watching this, or it wasn't really obnoxious, dreadful, terrible. Just awfully unpleasant.

Now let's get to why my rating is so high from what I've said so far. The dubbed version. This is the most hilarious tv animated series I've ever seen. Hands down. For some reasons the Japanese studio behind the og anime didn't really care about it anymore so the english dubbing studio could basically do whatever they want. They went ballistic. Incredibly, crazily ballistic. We went from Horror/Action anime to a ridiculously funny one. The jokes' timing is perfect, the references are on point, the 4th wall breaking is constant and hilarious, and the characters went from hateable to hateable because of how funny they are (if that makes sense).

This dub is, to my knowledge, considered as the founder of the ""abridged"" concept, when basically voice actors actually says funny things over the images even tho the original voice acting is serious, so it could be considered as a parody. But we reach genius level with Ghost Stories, cuz this dub is very much not a parody, and moreso very much official. Sure, you reeeeally have to be someone that has a free mind and that isn't easily offended, because dark humor is the main type of humor in Ghost Stories, and the cursing is also very much present, so definitely not kid-friendly humor, but that's my favourite kind of humor so that's probably why it hit the spot for me.

Overall, I rate this a 8/10, because, as much as I want to rate it a 10/10, we can't really forget that the original anime also count in the notation, and that it's only fair that this fact alone drags the score down a bit, but yeah, really really funny, very entertaining, this dub is the best/funniest dub from an anime ever."
Ghost Stories,"Original 5/10, English Dub is 11/10","So basically an American company got the rights to this for super cheap, and by the time the English actors went to record their dialog the producers expected the whole project to bbe a bust in the states. They told the actors to just ad lib and improvise whatever the hell they want to say. The result is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. There is no other anime that is like the dubbed version of this show. Again, the Japanese version is just a very basic ghost series. Kinda boring. The dubbed version is an entirely different thing. Do yourself a favor and watch this."
Ghost Stories,"FILL IN THE HOLE, HOLE FILLER!!!!!","Sure..........Jackass..........



What if Trey Parker and Matt Stone got the rights to direct and dub an anime? This is EXACTLY what would happen I think. Must see this dub, it's hilarious!"
Ghost Stories,This is why I love dubs,More dubs should be like this. It is one of the funniest anime ever. The actors where so lucky they got to do something like this.
Ghost Stories,The dub made this more funnier,"So the story is about some kids discovering new demons and unwrapping mysterious. With stereotypical characters.

The anime and plot itself was pretty cheesy and I probably would have dropped it weren't for the dub. For those who don't know this anime failed massively in japan so when it got the rights for a dub they just told the voice actors to do what ever they want.

It was dubbed into a style of a gag dub which included a lot of adult humour.

This in my opinion turned this boring trainwreck of an anime into a masterpiece.

Charleswright805 you must be out of your mind if you thought the original thing was good.

so yeah definitely check out the dub"

Ghost Stories,Tasty classic horror anime experience,"In my homeland, the dubbed version of this anime is pretty popular along the kids in the airing era (early 2000s). It's scary to some extent, humorous dialogue in each episode, and the suspense behind the ghosts' origins also captivating. I just found out that the English dub version are hilarious so I rewatched the subbed and Eng dub version. It turns out both were great! The sub version (and I think the dubbed version in my country) follows the same narrative, but the dub version is crazy and turns many cliche dialogues into a gem. What makes me like this anime so much, is about the ghost details. They are something that really comes from Japan old school urban legends, and the anime pretty much convey how it works. For the past few years I tried to looking for another classic horror anime, but many titles also including action and (too much) gore, making Yamishibai probably is the one that resembles this anime more. It's sad knowing this anime series aren't popular in Japan, because for me, what's best from anime sometimes isn't lots of blood gushes or 20 minutes of action scenes, it is the classic story that everyone know the premise, but stir it into an experience that so genuine, it's memorable."
Ghost Stories,Not because you're a rabbit but because you're black :)),"Rating 5.0

Favorite Episode: The Corpse that Roams in the Night - Shirotabi

DO NOT WATCH THE SUBBED VERSION. Seriously the english dub was a masterpiece, when it was funny I couldn't breathe. Five stars for the humor, but -5 for the god awful plot, if the plot was bearable this would be a 9/10."

Ghost Stories,One of the most hilarious shows I've seen!,"Normally shows that have plots like this annoy me, where someplace is haunted and blah blah blah. But this one didn't I took the time to sit down and watch it and it was so funny it made chocolate milk come out of my nose! Though the characters are in elementary school, probably around fifth grade, there is so much adult humor in this show that I couldn't stop laughing. The dialog is well written, witty, and hysterical. The ongoing banter between Satsuki and Hajime are the best I've seen, and if there is any reason to watch the show it's for Hajime! It will make you remember the days when you and your friends went searching for buried treasure, or played games like that! Even though... I've never actually gone into a haunted school house, it would be rather like this show if I did. I recommend anyone who likes anime to grab your best buds, pop some popcorn...make sure your parents arn't home for all the sexual innuendos that you will hear, and be prepared to laugh until you have tears streaming down your cheeks."
Ghost Stories,Hilarious,"Between the 80's/90's/ early 2000 reference and the way the characters just be coming at each other.....This is the best anime I seen humor wise. Dubbed version of course.

"" As much as you want it we can never be. It's not because your a rabbit... it's because your black!"" 😂😂😂😂"
Ghost Stories,The dub is one of the greatest comedies ever made,"If you get offended by absolutely anything, go away. This anime isn't for you. But if you can take a joke even if your own race or religion is the punchline, get ready for one of the funniest comedies ever made.

Through every second of this anime the voice actors are having so much fun it's impossible not to enjoy yourself. This not only makes it funnier, but also makes the dub sound far more natural and fluent than 99% of other dubs. The voice actors know what they are doing as they make it more than a collection of cheap jokes.

Honestly, this show is a comedic masterpiece. If you haven't watched it go find it on amazon prime or wherever its available in your country."
Ghost Stories,Absolutely hilarious!! One of the most underrated / slept on anime,Love this show! Wish there were more episodes. This whole show is just freaking wild start to finish lol. Would love to see them redo this anime with more modern references and better animation but it's completely fine as it is!
Ghost Stories,NICE!,This anime is perfect for those who don't have enough time to watch long running anime. Story is nice.
Ghost Stories,Really bad and boring and the dub doesn't save it,"Sure the English dub is funny, very funny at times, but this is a really bad anime and the dub doesn't save it."
Ghost Stories,"Its funny, if you forget that racisim homophobia and others things dont exist",The sub is horrible. But the ADV dub is hilarious. Its like an abridged series except it was made by professionals. But tbh its offensive. Like really offensive. But a lot of adult animated shows are offensive. Tbh you just have to chill out and enjoy it because at the end of the day you ranting on tumblr about how offensive it is isn't going to change anything.
Ghost Stories,Victory for Dub over Sub!,"Yes, I am going to be talking about the English Dub. The dub is what this show is now known for. It is the go-to example of how a dub can change everything. The show switches genres completely with the English dub, it goes from being a ""horror adventure"" to being a ""dark comedy"". And likewise, it changes the show from being a forgettable anime to much watch TV.

Story wise, the series could be comparable to a darker ""Gravity Falls"". Siblings come to a new spooky town and are guided through their journey by a relative's old journal. The original Japanese one is...meh. There's a reason why the show wasn't picked up for a second season, there wasn't much going for it.

Fast forward to 2004, companies are looking to capitalize on the anime boom that DBZ and SailorMoon helped start. But, then you give it to ADV and give them no notes, and you have yourself comedy gold.

They add so much to the show. They made Momoko a born-again Christian, made the little brother mentally slow and gave every random extra some hilarious quirk. Every episode had some incantation they'd chant to seal a ghost away. The English Dub changed each of these chants to be some juvenile joke. To say the show does not take itself seriously is a massive understatement. The characters will mock the script, the animation, and their shows own inconsistencies.

Some sub purists may be offended by how the dub dares to change their precious continuity. First off, No. There are no fans of the original show. Second, come on...this is hilarious. To quote Momoko herself, ""Is this a great show or what."""
Ghost Stories,Watch The Dub,"Ghost Stories is about a bunch of kids who fight ghosts. It is a comedy/horror.

It is based on a book series by Toru Tsunemitsu.

The plot of the show is very weak but it makes up for it in the dialogue. This anime is very funny.Some of the characters are a bit one dimensional but they are still great. The voice acting is very good too. The animation is very good for the time period it was made in.

I would recommend his to anyone interested in a good comedy."
Ghost Stories,What a real English dub should sound like,"Ah yes, an English dub better than that of Panty and Stocking. My favorite character has got to be Hajime. His lines were so funny! It sucks that the voice actors just had to forget about all the fun they had in the good ol' 2000's and kiss up to the woke crowd. What they don't know is this dub will surely tick off the people they suddenly pamper. And that's why I love this dub. If only people weren't so sensitive nowadays, we'd be living like The Jetsons."
Ghost Stories,I always skip my Spanish class to watch this,"The dub is the greatest thing that's ever been created. This is just beautiful. This is a gift to humanity. Everything about this series's dub is beautiful and perfect and wonderful and Momoko is best girl. Charles Wright is a silly little goober who doesn't understand good cinema. Don't listen to him. The Ghost Stories dub saved the entire show. Before, it was boring, monotonous garbage. Now, It's something more. It is a genuine, absolute masterpiece. If you want to make your life better, watch this anime dub NOW. For the love of god, I'm going to need a season 2 for this. I can't handle this anymore. WATCH THE DUB."
Ghost Stories,"Ghost Stories is a brilliant blend of coming-of-age, horror, and comedy. It's impossible not to love this series","My daughter and I recently watched the horror anime Ghost Stories (2000) on Prime. The storyline follows two siblings who move to their mother's hometown after her passing. They stumble upon a spellbook from their mom's past, and as they settle into their new school, that happens to be haunted, they unwittingly unleash spirits into their neighborhood. With the help of some newfound friends and a demon-possessed cat, the siblings must battle the newly released spirits.

This series was co-created by Noriyuki Abe (known for Bleach) and Steven Foster (known for Gilgamesh). The series is absolutely outstanding. The characters are straightforward and fun, but it's the witty dialogue, quirky ghosts, and the cat that steal the show. The dialogue is hilariously inappropriate, filled with clever Hollywood references that had me laughing out loud. The monsters are diverse, unique, and exceptionally well done; the toilet monster had me in stitches. I also appreciated the variety of monsters, some inspired by movies and others creatively original. There is so much to enjoy here.

In conclusion, Ghost Stories is a brilliant blend of coming-of-age, horror, and comedy. It's impossible not to love this series. I would score it a 9/10 and strongly recommend it."
Ghost Stories,A Cult Classic with Humorous Moments but Inconsistent Execution,"Ghost Stories, the controversial anime series known for its unique English dub, offers a blend of horror and comedy that has garnered a cult following. While the show delivers occasional humorous moments and a distinctively irreverent approach, its inconsistent execution and limited depth prevent it from reaching its full potential.

One of the strengths of Ghost Stories lies in its humor. The English dub, known for its bold liberties and comedic improvisation, adds a layer of amusement to the series. The witty and irreverent dialogue, coupled with the voice actors' energetic performances, results in laugh-out-loud moments. The intentional subversion of horror tropes and the self-awareness of the absurdity within the narrative add to the show's charm, making it an entertaining watch for those seeking a lighthearted take on the supernatural genre.

However, the inconsistent execution of Ghost Stories undermines its overall impact. While some episodes succeed in blending humor and horror effectively, others fall flat, struggling to strike a balance between the two. The varying quality of storytelling prevents the series from maintaining a consistent tone and pacing, which can be jarring for viewers seeking a more cohesive narrative experience.

Furthermore, Ghost Stories relies heavily on repetitive storytelling formulas. Each episode typically follows a formulaic structure, with the characters encountering a ghost or supernatural entity, leading to a confrontation and eventual resolution. The predictability of these encounters and the lack of narrative innovation can make the series feel formulaic and repetitive, diminishing the excitement and tension that horror stories should evoke.

The character development in Ghost Stories is limited, with most of the focus on the comedic interactions between the main cast. While the characters have distinct personalities and play off each other well, their growth and depth are often overshadowed by the show's comedic elements. The lack of substantial character arcs or emotional depth prevents the audience from forming strong connections with the characters, resulting in a missed opportunity to elevate the series beyond its comedic appeal.

Visually, Ghost Stories is average by modern standards. The animation quality and art style may not stand out compared to more recent anime productions. While the character designs are distinctive and the occasional spooky visuals create an eerie atmosphere, the animation itself can feel dated and lacking in fluidity.

In conclusion, Ghost Stories is a cult classic that offers occasional humorous moments and a unique approach to the horror genre. The irreverent English dub and comedic improvisation add to its appeal, providing an entertaining experience for those seeking a lighter take on supernatural storytelling. However, the inconsistent execution, repetitive formulas, limited character development, and average visual presentation prevent the series from achieving a higher rating. While it may have a dedicated fanbase appreciative of its comedic value, Ghost Stories may not resonate as strongly with viewers seeking more cohesive storytelling or substantial character depth."

All four claims to be best of friends for many years and in the show contradicting their own statements by being surprised to everything that happens, showing in reality they are meeting for the very first time. A complete waste of time and nothing more."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Totally unexpected,"I was expecting awful fights, drama and the usual gossip that comes with the ""wives of"" series and other reality shows. This one pleasantly depicts long lasting friendships and make you envious of their inner circle! Love their dynamic, and I think it's what made me come back to the episodes (not so much the fashion or anything else). Also love little glimpses into rest of their families.

Karan perhaps tries a little too hard with the QA sessions vs something a little more free flowing but the ladies are top notch - Maheep, Bhavana, and Seema that is.

Neelam- is she really like that? God what a bore. Such a sheltered grown ass baby. The woman version of a ""man child"". She really comes off like she has done no personal development since she was 15 and started in the industry. Very vanilla and stuck in the 80s. She's only got her looks going for her. Thank goodness she addressed her accent early on, cause even that was cringe.

Can't wait for season 3!"
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Unwarranted hate.,"I can feel why the show would feel pretentious and the mannerisms lethargic, but it's because we the middle class have not walked in their shoes and the way they talk can be attributed to the people they interact with on a daily basis , we all live in our own bubble and our social interactions are a reflection of that . I felt like the people in the show at their core were normal people who have their own insecurities and struggles , happy and sad days , have their own set of goals and aspirations , just because it don't match the way we look at life doesn't warrant the hate we are sprewing ,guys wealth alone can't make a person happy,abt the whole nepotism debate a parent who is successful at his/her profession be it at any field will only encourage their children to get into it the same right, agreed this will mean the real talented and hardworking people will lose their place in such a flawed system , but we do know bollywood is just another money making business and very few have the magnanimity to recognise talents and take risks on them , our institutions are never know to promote talent , coming back to the show this is definitely not the greatest out there and certainly not the worst , I skipped through most of it as it as a lot of it was not relatable to me , but the general gist of it didn't make me want to throw up or troll them as I came here expecting to see rich people showboating but I was surprised to see much more in it ."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,OMG why?,"Please stay away. Cringefest, fake accents, why Karan johar why?"
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Pathetic,Honestly couldnot watch after 15 mins. It's horrendous n the fake accents. Please kjo stay away from Netflix hi
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Worthless parasites,"Here comes stories of more worthless wanna bees of that dump called Bollywood. Makers of this show should be asked to clean toilets for years. These had been ugly souled women sold Their souls to the lowest bidder, can see in their faces."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Middle aged mothers think swearing is so cool,I was appalled when I watched this show with the family and could not believe what I was hearing. Wannabe celebrities thinking that four letter swear words are cool and a mark of well to do people - well I'm sorry to say it is not!! And these are mothers !!!
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,low budget copy of Kardashians,"If show is being targetted for Indian audience, it should have been in hindi instead of fake English accent. If show is targetted for NRIs, I think NRIs have much better content to watch on Netflix. Its a low budget copy of Kardashians show."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Torture and so much cringe,I am going to sue Netflix for the mental harassment caused by this show.No wonder starkids turns out to be arrogant and stupid when they are raised by parents like these..Save yourselves from this pandemic
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Crappiest thing i have seen in my life,No Indian can ever relate with the irritating lifestyle shown in this series They are just capitalising our hate so that they can make money from it also DISGUSTING ........🙅🙅 I want to request everyone to rate this series 1 🌟
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,"Classy, But The General Public Won't Appreciate","It's beautifully directed, a really out of the box idea and extremely professionally executed. Class written all over it.

Well educated, fab English speaking Bollywood families, raising their kids in the perfect manner.

There's tonnes to learn from this and appreciate. I want to congratulate the whole team for creating a ""worth every minute"" kind of programme.

We live in the UK and we enjoyed it very much.

Unfortunately, in the same breath I can understand how the masses may not appreciate it. It needs a certain class to appreciate it.

Thanks again guys, and good luck for the future ones."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Total Bakwaas,"The name should should not be 'Fabulous Lives oF Bollywood' to 'Fake lives of Bunch of unsuccessful people'

They are not even close to Bollywood. Who are these ppl. Public don't even know these ladies 🤣🤣😂

Anyways and sorry to add Neelam was never and good actress and she did not have any career on Bollywood and acting 😜. This is all about promoting there Brands as ppl don't know them. The total Bakwaas it was."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,review,"I watched the series and honestly felt the need to write about it. I have seen some reality shows of the US. The housewives of Beverly Hills etc. They try to show friendship but its always cold. This show somehow gives you warmth. If you compare it to Hollywood based reality shows, this is way better. As a mother who is working I felt good that these women being a mother and wives are also having fun"
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,A binge watch with already tasted masala,"If you have three-four hours of no work and outside world seems boring, you can choose to see this. It is a Indian Masala Sex & the city. There is nothing so fabulous about their live that you will want to watch, but this series may feel like a guilty pleasure for many. I have no complaints wasting my time to this. You can also finish some boring office work watching this, you can easily divert your attention without losing any bit of this series (it isn't that tough to catch up)."
The Fabulous Lives of Bollywood Wives,Karan Johar and GANG is just full of cheaters and nepo products..they can't think good because u need good heart for good thought,When I see karan JOHAR ..I couldn't bear his face.. Sushant's Father..Sister..all comes in front of me..and my heart goes with them.. when i saw my young son little bullied..then it scares me..how this MAN destroy someone's life ....i promise to my GOD..that i won't see his any movie untill sushant would get justice..

Falsa identidad,Falsa identidad season 1 review 8 out of 10,"I have to say I was quite surprised and impressed with this TV show. I've never watched a Spanish production show before. Movies yes but not a t.v show.

Falsa Identidad is quite high on the entertainmentment meter. It's not just about crime and cartel organisation. This show left me binge watching episodes for days. The characters and suspense were quite good.

It covers other genres quite well such as friendship, action, drama, romance, family, guilt, loyalty, betral, sex and much more

If you are looking to be entertained and thrilled, this show is far from being in short supply. Falsa Identidad is quite the ride. You will see some shocking moments. Every episode is exciting. Fully of sexy characters, and Spanish gangster atmosphere where no one except for some of the youths is exactly a good guy. The good guys are more grey than black or white. It can be dramatic and heart warming at times.

As it goes for shocking moments in t.v this one will not leave you disappointed."
Falsa identidad,"Real binge series - cliffhangers, great actors, fab dialogue","Love this show - quite addictive. Acting and dialogue are sensational. Lots of cliffhangers and the settings in Mexico and the US are visually excellent. Love the way interior designs match the characters - the flashy villain Mateo has kitsch nouveau riche Mex; the crusading lawyer Victoria's home is tastefully Vogue Living Mex; conservative Salas is tastefulyl understated; the tenement where Deivid, Diego, Gabby & Chucho live in Series 1 is tasteful shabby chic Mex, showing a meticulous eye to adding character depth to the settings."

Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"(Season 1) New, Bold, and Brilliant","I haven't watched a Gundam show in a while. And by ""a while"" I mean at least 10 years. I got tired of the repetitive action scenes, cookie-cutter characters, and plots that were just an excuse for conflict. I dismissed new titles with fancy words like ""Unicorn"" and ""F91"" attached to them as essentially Barbie getting a new hat. But, there was something about ""Iron Blooded Orphans"" that just was very compelling. I gave it a watch and I am so glad I did as this is one of the better Anime shows I have watched recently, Gundam or not.

Story-wise it's pretty simple, child slaves on Mars in the distant future rise up and take over the business they were once beholden to as property. ""Human Debris"" is the term they use here. These children have been modified with technology so that education and training is not necessary, just plug them in and they know what to do. This instantly makes the cast of young protagonists easy to get behind. How can you not root for enslaved children to win? The plot is a bit weighed down by politics, sub plots, and many factions in what feels like a jigsaw puzzle of a story at times. I actually went out of my way to learn many names of governments and factions that ended up playing little to no role in the plot itself. Don't trouble yourself too hard with these details. The meat of the plot is the kids and their fight to survive the war they have set themselves up for by standing up. This is not war in the sense of excuses to have battles, comment on how awful it is, then experience no loss as many of these shows often do, this treats battle for what it is- hell. Casualties are suffered and comrades are mourned on both sides with a gritty emphasis placed on the youth of the fallen. I finished a few episodes with a depressed feeling. The Gundam itself is almost an afterthought!

The plot is helped along with a colorful cast of characters. There is no main character to be sure, but a central core four. Starting with the pilot of the primary mech, Mikazuki. In past shows, this kid would be the focus of the show 90% of the time. But, he is so subdued that it would be hard to just concentrate on him. He seems almost boring at first, but you learn very quickly that it's just one layer to what may be the most complex character in franchise history. A devoted, loyal, and courageous fighter but also a stone cold killer. Capable of compassion and tenderness, but also a lust for blood. Mikazuki follows the orders of Orga, the leader of the kids, Orga serves as military commander, business manager, big brother, and in many ways father to children he leads, putting a lot of weight on his shoulders while still managing to keep an ever present spike on the tip of his hair. That thing could put someone's eye out! Hair do aside, Orga generates a lot of sympathy from the responsibility he holds. He must give orders that may result in the deaths of those who are- not just employees and soldiers- but family members. A position he struggles with at times, but succeeds in ultimately. Then there is Kudelia, the leading lady, I think she is where the show fails the most in characters. Serving as the ""only hope"" character, she is generic in that she wants equality for an oppressed people, while detesting violence. She hires the band of child soldiers to escort her to Earth to meet with ""X"" government to discuss ""Y"" trade laws, but also hates all the bloodshed she causes by embarking on this journey. Thankfully she accepts it as a necessary evil to accomplish a greater good, but otherwise serves only as a stereotypical princess and love interest for Mikazuki. Finally there is McGillis, the resident Char Aznable type, who serves as antagonist and anti-hero. I won't give too much away, but he is a man with plans of his own while serving Gjallahorn, the main bad guys in pretentiously over-the-top uniforms to match their snobby personalities, making them as easy to hate as the kids are easy to root for. The rest make up a strong supporting cast, including a guy who dresses like a pimp and has a bad-ass ship crewed by his harem of hot wives earning him the award of ""Luckiest Man In Space"".

The cast of mechs in this is a good one, too. The primary Gundam ""Barbatos"" is interesting in that it has very little in terms of fire power, but makes up it melee. Most of the mechs in this show rely on some form of hand-to-hand combat weapon as their primary piece, making it short on sweet, sweet, 'spolsion porn yet gnarly in the way they show the carnage and brutality of each impact, fluids (blood and oil) spew frequently, with a lot agonizing scenes of machines being torn apart methodically along with their helpless pilots. This was the first show I have seen that took the glamour away from being a Gundam pilot and equates it more like being a medieval era knight. The battle scenes are some of the finest I have seen in almost any Anime, and the art and effects showcased in the them is the best I have seen in a Gundam series. Speaking of art, the character designs themselves are very bright and colorful, contrasting the dark atmosphere they live in, and hearken back to the days of the original series. They even have one of the male characters pilot a bright pink mobile suit. Real men wear pink. Just ask Vegeta. I found the music be to only above average with some good opening and closing themes to start with, ""Raise Your Flag"" by Man With A Mission served as a good tune to get the blood pumping for an episode and ""Orphans no Namida"" by Misia as a more bluesy and sullen closing theme that is catchy and fits the often sad endings to many episodes. The Sub vs. Dub battle here is no contest in my opinion, the Japanese cast destroys the English one in terms of quality of performance and fit. There is also a slight emphasis on the fact they speak Japanese, so accuracy plays a part as well. Go Sub or go home.

This is a gritty experience from start to finish, yes the cast is primarily young children, but they are not innocent. They are products of the environment they were raised in. Each day is a fight to survive, not just for their own future, but for the ones who died fighting for that future. The show succeeds brilliantly in it's mix of emotional moments and awesome fight scenes so that it feels like a complete experience. The season ends well with a sense of closure, but still leaves plenty open for Season 2 which I eagerly look forward to. I would dare call this show a masterpiece if it were not for some episodes that dragged too long with politics and a few side characters that were introduced suddenly and forced to develop too quickly (looking at you, Carta Issue). I enjoyed this show immensely and recommend it to Anime fans in general as a great intro to the Gundam franchise and a very good series regardless. 9/10. Check it out. Cheers!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,More mature Gundam,"I just feel this series had the main characters in a bigger struggle than the other series. As the name suggested they are mostly from orphan backgrounds or situations and found together and be counted. There is certainly more struggle and risk involved.

This made their achievements even more significant."

Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Awesome!,"I've always been a fan of Gundam. I think the politics, the good story, and the great animation are always appealing to a mature crowd. This Gundam series was exceptional and full of feelings, truths about life, and a realistic ending which made it ever more meaningful than most of the Mobile suit stories. I hope that everyone that watches this show enjoys it as much as I did. Great in all the sense of the word."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,A Master piece...!! Underrated Anime,"Please watch this Anime, you don't have to have knowledge on other Gundam series to watch this. This Anime has everything in it, it concentrates on social issues like Political affairs, Corruption, betrayel, poverty, child labour, War calamities, Friendship, leadership...!! It's about children who just wanted to lead a normal life in the midst of Chaos!!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,New gundam for modern viewer not that ideal for kids though,"Life is never black and white, there are a lot of grey areas..not being able to adapt , will only limit ones potential to go the unknown, reach the unreachable that others can. That's why i love the ending this is the most realistic and modern way of telling a story of tragic child soldier of wars...... u cant romanticize it like GUNDAM SEED or fantasize it like GUNDAM 00, this is just perfect way of showing how the real world is imperfect and unfair , sometimes brutally injustice but if one were to make a big enough impact through sheer determination and sacrifices sometimes, just sometimes u gain the fruits of life in the end, the goals that most want, a sense of freedom to discover the purpose of life for those unfortunate in life. Like orga said, there is only one way forward, and don't stop believing... this really conclude a strong Japanese spirit and moto of life."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Incredible, suspenseful, heartbreaking","This is easily in my opinion the best Gundam of all time, and one of the best anime's of all time. Season one is a 10/10 masterpiece and although season 2 is not as good it is still excellent 9/10."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,A top 5 Gundam series,"This is the first Gundam series I ever watched and since then I am huge Gundam fan ! It has everything: cool characters, awesome story, action, bittersweet ending and more... If you 've never watched Gundam before, you should start with this one and I believe that you won't regret it!"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,You will cry ...you will screen.. anime with better ending,A lots of action.. Emotion.. One of the best story line.. And well directed
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Not bad, but not as good as all the 10/10 reviews",Comentario no disponible
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Best Gundam and anime for me,"Seriously one of the best anime's I have seen. The emotions, the bond and all of that. The end of S2 was really sad. But man this crap was better then most non anime movies and series."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Good but slow with immense stupidity.,The series is pretty good but definitely not one of the better ones. There's a lack of a lot of fight scenes where there could have been and said there's a lot of convoluted plot twists. Also in other moments later on in the second season where there could have been more action instead there are big gaps with just immense stupidity that's really hard to watch. At many points I wanted to give up because I felt that this character in these choices that are being made are so hard to watch.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Very, very slow start",Comentario no disponible
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Stuck in awe,I can't get over the fact how messed up my emotions are after finishing season 2. Lol. I don't even cry at funerals and this one pushed me close to the edge. I'm telling myself to snap out of it - repeatedly reminding myself none of these people are real. The story was being excellent. If it hadn't received an award it should. Much respect to its creators
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,"Raw, powerful, and emotional. A must watch.","An incredible series from start to finish. I'm struggling to put it in words after only just finishing season 2. You find yourself completely taken in by the raw and gritty struggle of the characters from start to finish. The rising up of the down trodden, whom as often are in Gundam, only children. This certainly isn't a Gundam series for children to watch though. Dark in many parts, its brutal nature brings a serious realisation to the issues and suffering of the people in this world.

The story aside, even the editing adds to the emotion when the end of some episodes spill over as the credits start rolling. Excellent.

I strongly recommend this as someone who is a Gundam fan, but one that has been looking for one with such a raw feeling to it without the over the top heroics and Mobile Suits (there are some of course)."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Very cool,"I was very happy to get this edition of the first season of Iron Blooded Orphans. The whole package is great quality! The box comes in a nice plastic sleeve that protects it while making it look nice. The Card board holder for the Blu-ray boxes is really strong and finished with a polished design that makes it sturdy and great to hold your Blu-ray boxes in (there is even room for season 2 when that comes out). The art book is a cool little added bonus and the Model was fantastic! It's a high grade model and the metallic injection style really was a nice touch. All in all, I highly recommend getting this if you're a fan of Gundam."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,One of the best,"Amazing story line great action best I've seen in a long long time

You might even watch it twice

Top draw"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Great!,I have not watched a Gundam series in a while (since Gundam SEED) so when i watched Orphans i was amazed on how good the show is. I would recommend this show to both fans and new comers.
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Not the best Gundam show,"Granted I've only seen 3 and read the Thunderbolt manga, for the most part they're a depiction of the art of war as well as being drenched with politics, with this you don't really get that.

Instead you follow a bunch of loud mouth kids, as they take on anyone who gets in there way. Even gangster's, at that point I was hoping they're have their comeuppance but it just made things worse. The main problem I have with the series is how stupid it is, you can't go from being a slave to having your own spaceship and escorting a princess, logically it just doesn't work.

Let talk about the princess quickly so she's from wealth obvious, he wants mars to have independence so she decides to team up with slaves. I kind of get but at the same time she think that she's had it rough like them, no just not. As for everyone else the Gundam pilot doesn't have a personality but everyone looks up to him for some reason. The actual main guy in this is Orca, he's so cock sure of himself, doesn't matter how many people die he just wants to achieve his ever changing goal. The rest of the guys in this are basically the same, mindless sheep that just follow orders. I did kind of like the new group in the second season, they had a bit of flavor to them as well as the main villain through the series, shame the disguise where blatant and obvious, they tried it twice and both times it was as clear as down who they were.

Now lets talk about the fights, they were most good but had some hiccups. Like the end of season one they had to throw in a big battle but the outcome is so clear it sucks all the tension out of the scene, actually the same can be said about the finally. It was laid out differently but you could tell how it was going to end, I think the most interesting fights were all by the secondary characters. My personal favorite only actually got about 2 or 3 episodes, I think is where one of the problems lie, all the interesting characters are all back up.

All in all I did enjoy watching the show, quality wise it just doesn't hold up to the other Gundam. I even think Unicorn looked a lot better, which is weird being it made 5 years before. Gundam's main selling point is it's depiction of war and the politics, as that doesn't really happen in this I felt a little disappointed. Quality wise I would say this was on par with Neon Genesis Evangelion, though both have there ups and downs, they're worth a watch and can be quite fun."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,First time review ever,"This will be my first ever review ever of anything, but this series had me both mad and satisfied . On one hand one expects the protagonist to always win, but alot of Japanese drama ends in tragedy, this is neither one but the perfect balance. Great story telling, amazing characters building, some sexy innuendo, and lots of moral lessons. All in all, a series way above expectations, at one point I was expecting the mega tragic type of Japan type of drama a d you do get that but way more. Highly recommend. Is way better than I jad expected. Its starts slow please give it a chance is way better."
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Constantly things happening I didn't see much of story,"Constantly things blowing up, screaming, rocket thrust. It was just too annoying noisy, brought memories of my favorite x-men show even though that also a bit annoying noisy"
Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans,Corny and Derivative,"The characters are cookie cutter, predictable anime characters that we have seen a million times already, including the all-too-common Gary Stu who is a super cool teenager doing an adult's job with inhuman skill that has multiple female characters swooning over him. Of course, like many animes, the show also has the usual annoying ""fan service"" thanks to the typical, forced ""princess"" character (among several other female roles) who looks like a 14 year old barbie doll. Even worse than that is one of the characters being an adult man who is engaged to a 9 YEAR OLD GIRL!? Freakin' pedophile writers. Every line, every scene, every cheesy moment makes me roll my eyes. The only good thing about this show is the animation quality, which is above average, but nothing else. It's basically just the type of bottom of the barrel anime one tends to watch when you are out of everything else."

Santa Clarita Diet,Brilliant,"I saw this show advertised and thought it may be OK to fill a gap if there was nothing much else on to watch.

The first episode was good, so I watched the second, then the third, and couldn't stop watching it as each episode got better and better as the characters developed.

Each and every performance in this comedy is brilliant, from the most minor of supporting roles to the lead cast.

I really didn't have high expectations, but this comedy is HILARIOUS"
Santa Clarita Diet,Netflix we Need a Santa Clarita Diet Season 4!!,Comentario no disponible
Santa Clarita Diet,Unexpectedly Hilarious,"My first thought when watching this show was that it was a combination of DEXTER, THE WALKING DEAD, and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES. The first episodes were good, but I couldn't really imagine how it would sustain. Then the plot twists came, and it just got better and better.

Some of the bit are so gross they are hilarious. I'm laughing even though I can barely look. But it's comedy we need these days.

Great cast for a funny show that doesn't take itself too seriously, but simply provides clever get-away-from-it-all content.

I really hope the show continues. Great job."
Santa Clarita Diet,WTF Netflix!,"So mad they cancelled this excellent comedy. The actors were so charming and funny, especially Oliphant! He cracked me up every time I saw his tense smiling face! The concept was fresh and I love zombie flicks. Rare a comedy makes me laugh out loud so often, and guaranteed in each episode. So bummed. I want it back already. Bring it back!"
Santa Clarita Diet,DON'T CANCEL THE SHOW!,It is weirdly the best comedy show that I have seen for a long time. It makes me laugh out loud while disgusted at the same time. It doesn't deserve to be canceled in its 3rd season at all. Especially like this.
Santa Clarita Diet,Netflix did a horrible mistake of cancelling this show.,One of the weirdest shows I have ever seen. But it was awesome.Why good shows keep getting cancelled.
Santa Clarita Diet,Whoever canceled this should be fired,"Fun and enjoyable show that didn't take itself serious and netflix buckled under the pressure again, because god forbid you keep a good show."
Santa Clarita Diet,Short Sighted,"Another quality show cancelled by short sighted executives, such a shame"
Santa Clarita Diet,Super disappointed that it is being canceled!,If they're going to cancel shows can they at least wrap them up. Especially the way it ended:(
Santa Clarita Diet,Hilarious,"I wasn't a fan of the pilot episode. I felt that it was weird and off. But then I decided to watch the next episodes, and I got hooked because it became better and better. Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant have a great chemistry, and I also love Liv Hewson playing their only kid. Mary Elizabeth Ellis is clearly the funniest as their neighbor Liz.

The third season is the best, which is why I got disappointed when I found out that there will be no more fourth season. Why, Netflix, why? I was really looking forward to the next season then...surprise...it's cancelled. Really?"
Santa Clarita Diet,Was not expecting it to be as funny as it was,"I've been wanting to watch Santa Clarita Diet since season one first came out in 2017 but kept putting it off because there was always something else I wanted to watch more. Well, I finally got around to watching it and it was great. I'm actually mad at myself for putting it off until now. I had no idea it was going to be so funny. Timothy Olyphant and Drew Barrymore are both terrific in this. Especially Olyphant. Justified is one of my all time favorite tv shows so I'm a big fan of his but I had no idea he could be as funny as he was in this. I knew he could be funny but not like this. The teenage neighbor, Eric (Skyler Gisondo), is also hilarious in this. Every character on this show is so well written. It took a few episodes before it finally found itself but once it did it was great. At only 30min episodes it's an easy binge. This is just a flat out fun show."
Santa Clarita Diet,Bloody new comedy by Netflix,"I was looking for something to watch on Netflix before I go to bed when I saw they just released the new 'Santa Clarita Diet' show. The marketing material looked interesting, and I'm always intrigued when they drop a new show! I am three episodes in and about to start the fourth one, so far I like it.

The show is very watchable in my opinion but the production value is pretty average in general. In fact, compared to other Netflix shows, you can tell the money went to the cast, which is great by the way. Even though you have Drew Barrymore, Timothy Olyphant, Patton Oswalt and Nathan Fillion appearing, I was expecting a little bit more from the performances given so far.

The story is amusing, there's a very attractive premise but it doesn't quite get there for me, however I'm having fun with the show, the comedy is mostly working. Props to the special effects, the blood and the vomit are definitely gross! I could see this grow on me as I'm watching it. If you are in the mood for a decent dark comedy, this is a different show by Netflix that might not be for everyone!

6.5/10"
Santa Clarita Diet,"Dark, offbeat and fresh.","Like most other viewers, I'm not completely finished with the first season of Netflix's original Santa Clarita Diet, but I'm confident enough to submit my review already.

I was caught off-guard when my Mom asked me about a show I had never heard of, as it's usually the other way around, when she proceeded to fill me in on Netflix's newest project debut. I've been a fan of Timothy Olyphant from the first film I saw him in, the odd-ball Girl Next Door. I thought he did a great job handling the funnier aspects of the character and I've been keeping tabs on his comedy ever since.

I feel the same way about Drew Barrymore and think she's a great actress. Like Olyphant, Barrymore thrives in comedy roles that allow her goofball personality to shine, and Santa Clarita Diet perfectly encapsulates her ability to play the quirky, smart and funny female lead who is also still believable and someone you can relate to. With subject matter as potentially as dark as this show is, her charm balances it out and makes some of the more questionable acts really funny.

The supporting cast has been amazing so far as well, especially the daughter and the neighbor boy. I think they balance each other out very well, and I expect in future episodes that they'll take more of a leading role in the series, and maybe even become the ""responsible"" ones. The neighbors, and the gang of women who hang out, are also just odd enough to break the Stepford Wives cliché and make their part of the show interesting. The show is a situation in which there's something oddly satisfying going on, but keeping up, and also digesting exactly what's going on is challenging to do. It keeps you interested with the acting while also throwing insane things in your face simply because it can.

If you're a fan of absurdist/black comedy, pointing out obvious clichés, and allowing actors to be themselves, you'll be interested in giving Santa Clarita a shot. The flavor of comedy is certainly unique, and when dealing with the subject matter this show deals with, uniqueness is a necessity in order for the project to thrive."
Santa Clarita Diet,"Please, do NOT cancel this show!","For anyone who's followed the show for the past 3 seasons, I do not need to even explain why this show is way too good to be cancelled at this point. Meanwhile, other shows with not even half the talent and script continue on air. I hope this decision gets reconsidered, the show and it's cast as well as fans deserve better than this. I am thouroughly dissapointed."
Santa Clarita Diet,Don't cancel!!,This is an amazingly hilarious show!! Very upset it's being cancelled. Makes me want to cancel Netflix subscription
Santa Clarita Diet,Underrated Comedy,"I just watched Santa Clarita Diet with my brother and it had us both laughing out loud. It was freaking hilarious. It stars Timothy Olyphant and Drew Barrymore as Joel and Shiela, married realtors who live in Santa Clarita raising their teenage daughter. Shiela wakes up one dead feeling strange and throws up. She also has no heartbeat. She's a zombie. Not like the ones you usually see in movies or shows, she looks and feels as good as she ever has. The problem is that she has to eat people to survive though. So they try to find the worst kind of people to kill for Shiela to eat. What follows is a lot of funny and sometimes dark moments."
Santa Clarita Diet,Best Marriage in TV History,"I just finished re-watching this show, and it's even better than I remembered.

The concept of the show is quite surreal (zombies, casual murders, and lots of vomit), so it might not be for everyone. But if you are willing to dive into the absurdness of it all, you are in for a ride.

It's actually funny without being depressing, which is quite rare in these days. It is unique and original, and interesting, and so much fun. This show has an assembly of really well thought-out characters, where each has their own individual multi-dimensional personality. I really cannot think of a weak link when it comes to a character in this show.

Timothy Olyphant and Drew Barrymore do an absolutely phenominal job of playing a married couple, trying to get by under very absurd and unusual conditions. Their chemistry really manages to capture the day-to-day interaction between a married couple who genuinely love and like each other. Without any doubt one of the best marriages I ever saw on TV.

More than anything, the viewer can feel that the creators of this show put a lot of thought and heart into this show - and it is clear that they had fun while doing so.

Even years after it finished, this still remains the Netflix show I am the most upset was cancelled. If you don't mind a bit of absurdity, this show is a gem that you will be grateful to have watched."
Santa Clarita Diet,Who's your favorite mombie?,"Mine's Drew BarrEATmore. That's right. You heard me. Nothing beats the sardonic humor she dishes out as she gnaws on a humerus bone. When she plays a role, she really gets down to the guts of it. (Pun Intended). Tim Olyphant is top notch in his role as the spaced out nut of a husband. Liv Hewson is one of the best comedic young actresses on the rise. Skyler Gisondo is an amazing supporting comedy actor in his own right. This show is like Butter Rum Life Savers. I can't get enough of them or Santa Clarita Diet."
Santa Clarita Diet,7.4/10. Recommended,"FIRST SEASON : 7,3/10

SECOND SEASON : 7,6/10

THIRD SEASON : 7,2/10.

This is a good comedy horror tv series, with emphasis on ""COMEDY"", this is not scary neither intense. At times, i would even call it brilliant. There are many funny scenes. There is wit, somewhat original script, it's never boring. Its greatest quality is acting. These actors seem to enjoy this a lot, they seem that they had the time of their lives. Barrymore, Olyphant, Ellis etc. Young actors were great too (Hewson, Gisondo), they were definitely among the most likeable young characters i have watched recently. The interaction between all of these characters was a joy to watch.

This is not exciting, you will not be on the edge of your seat. Still interesting, funny and well acted."
Santa Clarita Diet,This show is an absolute comedy gem!,"An absolute gem! Out of all the good shows that are cancelled, this one that I'm disappointed the most with the cancellation decision. I was never a fan of fantasy/zombie/vampire type genres. I happened to watch this show at work (I support people with special needs and one of them liked this show). My first impression was that ""oh it's one of them cheap production weird shows"". But as the I went past the first two episodes and the story and characters developed I realised how hilarious this series is. And I mean that unironically. The jokes and the writing is clever and witty! The main characters are endearing, the side characters are hilarious, the twists are captivating, the show doesn't take itself too seriously but the love put in making the show is also apparent...etc. Each character also has a unique personality and you find yourself caring and for them all. It has got some comic book vibes as well. Everything about this show is brilliant! If I have one wish,.. well obviously I'd wish for world peace and peace, end world hunger and all that. But if I had one selfish pleasure wish, I'd wish for this show production to resume."
Santa Clarita Diet,Most of the time illogical but a real time killer,"Between reality and fun, Santa Clarita stands the perfect binge watch Netflix series to time kill. The situational comedies are great factor of this series. It may not fit to your brain but it tickles your funny bones and so I would surely recommend it to watch. Although it's sad to see Netflix canceling it after 3 seasons."
Santa Clarita Diet,Great Show,"I read the crap one star review and felt compelled to write my own simply because it could not be more wrong.

Note to reviewers: actually watch the whole show. Clearly that reviewer watched one or two episodes although I suspect even less than that.

Comparatively the first few episodes are not as good as those that follow but I think that is because they are really setting up the story and establishing the characters.

There are so many funny moments which mostly arise from situations going from bad to worse. I found the show quite compelling and very entertaining. YMMV.

No way is this show one star. No way."
Santa Clarita Diet,A housewife with an appetite for brains...,"Oddly enough then this series had eluded me for 2 seasons, which is very strange because I am big fan of everything zombie. And when I did find out that this Netflix series was about a suburban housewife turning zombie but retaining her cognitive ability, then I was hooked immediately. I sat down and binged watched two seasons in no time and I loved it.

The characters in the series were quite interesting, but also very detailed and fleshed out for the audience to enjoy.

The storyline was great, and it had all the right elements of comedy and light-hearted gore and horror to make it ghastly enjoyable.

I was rather impressed with the cast ensemble here and I didn't even know that Drew Barrymore was in it. But it wasn't her whom impressed me the most, that was Timothy Olyphant with his amazing performance. And I think this series really was an eye opener for me in terms of his skills and on-screen performance.

""Santa Clarita Diet"" is definitely well-worth watching if you enjoy the zombie genre, because it is a fresh injection of material into the genre. Lots of laughs and a good amount of gore as well, so there is something for everyone. I just saw that there is a season three for ""Santa Clarita Diet"", this I need to catch up on..."
Santa Clarita Diet,I tried to enjoy it,"This was soooo unfunny, it would have been amusing if the actors did not speak and act like ongoing punchlines, it was so bad i gave up half way through series One episode two, just tedious, everything i hate about bad American comedy."
Santa Clarita Diet,Full Circle executed perfectly,This show was cancelled but that is what made it brilliant. This show has the most best cliffhangers ever and I hope they dont ruin it by making a movie or a spin-off. Its not for the faint of heart and contains extremely graphic scenes. People that say its not funny don't understand that comedy is subjective and this show contains many subtle nuances and incredible acting by lead characters. Every main character comes full circle and the show leaves no stone unturned. It is also a fresh take on the zombie genre without repeating things we've already seen in countless shows and movies. The acting is incredible and its nice to see something having canonical symmetry. It's quite similar to a play consisting of three acts and three seasons achieving perfect curvature by the end. It also includes one of the best on-screen couples without the cliché infidelity storyline seen in literally every show or movie that has a couple in it.

Abstract: The Art of Design,,
Jailbreak,Love behind bars.,"Staff at a corrections facility are shocked to learn that their colleague, Vicky White, a stalwart of the facility has fallen in love with an inmate, Casey White, and helped him to escape.

What an absolutely crazy story, talk about an unexpected love story. It's a very well made, intriguing storyline, well made, interesting and surprising, with some fascinating interviews.

I had a feeling it would have a tragic ending, and it really does, what a way for this story to end, a tragedy.

It doesn't seem as though Casey was a particularly good guy, he wouldn't have ended up where he did I guess, but what on Earth was Vicky thinking, what a crazy risk to take. One thing that seems obvious, they fell for eachother.

One question I came away with, is nobody monitoring those phone calls inside the prison? Surely someone would have clocked the sheer volume of calls?

7/10."
Jailbreak,Vicky: Not as Innocent as She Seems,"So, I watched ""Jailbreak Love on the Run"" and, let me tell you, I'm swimming against the tide here. Vicky? Not exactly a damsel in distress. She knew the ropes and was well aware of the rules she was flouting, which could have landed her in hot water. And Casey? He wasn't just along for the ride. The documentary, in my opinion, didn't lay all the cards on the table. If they had been keeping an eye on things like they should have, this whole caper would have been shut down early. And seriously, who's ever heard of anyone being allowed out of uniform? No way.

Now, let's dive into the behind-the-scenes antics. This could have been stopped so early if people were actually doing their jobs. Red flags were popping up like crazy, and yet, nothing. The documentary made it clear there were some serious management issues. We didn't hear from many perspectives, which makes me wonder if some people kept quiet out of fear of retaliation. Wouldn't surprise me one bit.

So, in conclusion, this documentary needed more expansion and less ""let's gloss over the juicy bits."""
Jailbreak,Life Imitating Art,"I would not believe that this could actually happen in the prison system but here you have it. Vicky White, who has a senior position at the jail, falls in love with Casey White, a dangerous offender who is looking at 75 years imprisonment and has now confessed to another murder.

This woman is obviously lonely and vulnerable as she gets taken in by her prisoner because he tells her that she has a nice butt. From there, they begin an intimate relationship in the prison; it's astounding to me that they are never caught. It seems like the other prisoners in this overcrowded cell are aware of what's going on, but the staff are completely ignorant to it.

This love she has for her Casey will cost her dearly.

I'm perplexed as to why women guards are even in the male prison system. It does seem dangerous, especially if some of the prisoners are violent and require maximum security.

Interesting story that almost seems to outrageous to be true and I'm sorry that the ending turned out the way it did. Glad that Netflix didn't drag this out and make it into a limited series.

I recommend."
Jailbreak,Love Or Manipulation?,"Not an awful documentary but strangely portrays the situation as a Romeo and Juliet meets Bonnie and Clyde love story.

I don't doubt that Vicky White cared deeply for Casey but I can't believe Casey reciprocated her feelings.

Casey White is a manipulator. He found a weakness in Vicky that he used in an attempt to get him out spending the rest of his life in prison. People like him are skilled in finding the most vunerable and know how to play the game.

I think it is a tragedy that Vicky's legacy as a steller employee was completely ruined the instant she gave in to her emotions. She simply should've known better.

Decent documentary."
Jailbreak,Love knows no rules and regulations,"Love does make you do the weird, wild and unthinkable things. It seems love is not just blind, it numbs your mind too. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. This true story has more excitement and suspense than a fictitious thriller.

How else can you explain a lady officer of a correctional facility getting friendly and falling in love with a much younger inmate who is in prison on a charge of murder. A case of fence eating grass. Worse how can this lady plan to run away with him in order to settle down with him in some remote location.

With years of experience in procedures of the law did she not realize that this escapade would end in their arrest not to speak of the shame it would bring to all concerned ?

The movie keeps you riveted throughout even though the narrative is in an unconventional format with extensive use of CCTV footage with faces blurred. The voice over and the storyline is well done keeping the suspense live."
Jailbreak,A Tragic Tale of Passion and Prison Break,Comentario no disponible
Jailbreak,Sad story,"On April 29, 2022, Vicky took Casey out of his cell to transport him to the nearby courthouse. Or, rather, that's what she claimed she was doing; instead, she and Casey got into her vehicle and vanished. By the time her fellow corrections officers realized what was going on, the duo was long gone. This was stunning to everyone, including Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office investigator Sgt. Matt Burbank, who had known Vicky for years and, like everyone else, immediately feared she might be in danger. However, upon finding her abandoned car and searching her home, he quickly deduced that she wasn't a victim but an accomplice. Before long, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton was appearing on television to spread the word about this crime to the public, all as a U. S. Marshals team led by commander Chad Hunt initiated an urgent manhunt."
Jailbreak,Dishonest Portrayal,"Vicky was certainly experienced enough in her position- having worked there for over seventeen years- portraying her as some simpleton that was merely looking for love and fell for the wrong guy is disingenuous, at best. There's a lot of excusing of stupidity here, and if the roles were reversed i sincerely doubt we would see a male guard portrayed so sympathetically or as an innocent who was merely led astray by a predator. Casey is definitely preying on her vulnerability, but as an employee surrounded by men every second of her working day (50-60 hours her WEEK) one would think the need for fortifications and reinforcements in place to ensure this was not even a possibility. There should never be any vulnerability to exploit, and one should never be acting as some sort of 'surrogate' of a mother or worse, a lover, for inmates with nothing to lose and everything to gain by exploiting these employees. I understand sympathy, or even empathy, but that's what those incarcerated are looking for- a way in. Even if there isn't ill-intent on behalf of the inmate, you're becoming a loophole for them. Just as the inmate interviewed talked about trying to ferret out those who threatened to out the affair, he expressed anger over her not being able to be his 'mommy figure'. That is absolutely not her job, and that should never be something expressed to these inmates. That she was constantly going out of her way for her favorite inmates or that of her 'boyfriend' says everything wrong with this entire debacle.

One has to wonder in what type insanity would you ever have an opposite sex employee that oversees so much of the daily goings on? The entire reason she was able to escape the view of her coworkers and/or superiors is because she was responsible for so much of every facet of the facility. Even if opposing sexes are needed, more oversight is absolutely necessary and should be mandatory; the checks and balances didn't even exist here and nobody could see past their own duties to even consider this a vague possibility. There's absolutely no way Vicky wasn't just as culpable, and maybe even more so. Someone has to be the adult in the room or we're looking at mass chaos of the highest order.

It wasn't an unbearable watch, but there were portions far too incredulous to digest. Far too many people placed far too much confidence in someone who was, what seems to be, merely abflattering compliment away from an incredibly felonious act with zero regard for the path of wreckage left in her wake."

The Ritual,Worth a watch.,"I really liked this movie. Yes, the ending could've been better, a lot better, but it was really psychologically thrilling and spooky, especially for a Netflix movie. I'm really impressed with Netflix's content lately.

I see trends in the low star reviews that I want to address.

1) ""the ending was bad"" I agree, but the rest of it wasn't. A movie with a bad ending isn't going to be the best movie of all time, but if I enjoy watching 90% of the movie, then I would say I got my time's worth. It's just a shame that it didn't take the opportunity to use the ""monsters who scare your mind, not just rip up your body"" thing that it could have had going for it.

2) ""not scary enough"" it was suspenseful and creepy. It's more psychologically thrilling than outright terrifying, and I genuinely wonder which movies these people deem scary enough for them to enjoy because most horror movies really suck, especially in the past 20 years. Where are they finding all these ""genuinely scary"" movies? Or are they just consistently always disappointed with all of the horror movies they watch but keep watching them anyways? I have a lot of questions.

3) ""didn't capture the essence of the book"" why does everyone who reads a book that gets made into a movie feel the need to say this? I'm not sure if they just like being pretentious or if they genuinely believe a 90 minute movie must entirely capture the essence of a full length novel. There's no reason to judge them as if they need to be identical. They're standalone works. When I choose to watch the movie, I would hope that they don't drag it out as long as turning a book into a literal script would require.

4) ""Blair witch rip off"" very few movies, songs, books, etc. are truly original. You can make a movie with the same basic story tone as another one. Add your own twist, or don't, whatever, I'm not the purity police - just make an entertaining work without breaking copyright laws. If I'm entertained, I don't care if it resembles something else that also entertained me.

Anyways, if you read this entire review to learn if this movie is worth a watch, you clearly don't have anything better to do so just watch it. It's not bad."
The Ritual,Good Old Fashioned Horror,"No spoilers in this review but having come away from watching this film, on my own at the local Empire Cinema on Friday 13th I would say this is a good horror film for those who are bored senseless by the endless tide of ""jump scare but not scary really"" horror films we have to endure these days.

This is a proper story with a proper start, middle and end.

At times unsettling, at times creepy, at times a bit distressing whilst always being restrained (its not an utter gore fest and the violence is all the more affecting for that) this is a decent film elevated by good characterisation and very good acting.

Whilst nothing utterly original is on offer here, it is a film that does what it says on the tin and it is all done well. Special mention to Rafe Spall who, just like his dad, Timothy, continues to be brilliant in everything he's in.

Solid 7/10 and one for fans of proper horror. It deserves to be seen at the cinema as well so I'd urge people to get to watch this."
The Ritual,Strong start but poor final act.,Comentario no disponible
The Ritual,Promising Start. Sturdy Middle-Act. Underwhelming Finale.,"Making effective use of its isolated setting to amp up its claustrophobic aura, The Ritual begins on a promising note, gets even better with a tense middle act but all the potential it had of finishing as a thrilling example of its genre is ultimately squandered by its underwhelming final act.

The story follows a group of four friends who embark on a hiking trip in Sweden to honour their recently deceased pal. Things take an unexpected turn when they decide to go off-trail by taking a shortcut and are lost in the woods. To make matter worse, they are being stalked by a menacing presence.

Directed by David Bruckner, the premise is set up rather quickly with a finely crafted prologue and once the characters go off-trail, the director expertly switches gears by smartly utilising the silence & mystery of the surroundings to ratchet up the tension while the excellent camerawork & brooding score only add to its foreboding aura.

The characters aren't fleshed enough to make us invest in their journey but their shared predicament is still relatable. The tension is nerve-wracking when it's done right but few creative choices don't work out in its favour. Performances aren't any impressive but the cast still manages to deliver enough with what they are given.

On an overall scale, The Ritual had the opportunity to secure its place amongst the better examples of indie horror in recent years and was on trail during the first hour but the last 30 minutes foil the overall journey, for it doesn't pack the same punch as what unfolded before. At its best when capitalising on our fear of the unknown, The Ritual finishes as just another middling entry in the horror genre."
The Ritual,Safest place in the world are actually the Swedish woods,"As a film, I really enjoyed it. Kinda creepy, and it was well executed from cast to photo to everything.

Only thing i oppose, as a Swede, is the image of the Swedish woods as something scary. It really isn't, I'm sorry to say. I have spent a good many nights there in tents and cabins, and I am pretty well educated about the folklore. This one turns into something that is reall none-Scandinavian in terms of that. None of the ""rituals"" or creatures have nothing to do with actual lore. Sure, they speak about norse figures like the children of Loki, but that is just silly.

As a fright-flick, though, it is good.

And for you to know: We do have scary creatures in the woods. But we who live here know them, and they look like nothing as projected here. Come and see."
The Ritual,Stick to the road,"Never read up on this so went in blind.

What I found was tense and well done affair that gave as much as it promised.Kept up the tension all the way and some of the cinematography and audio really brought the theatre to life.

Able acting all the way through and had just enough jumps to stop it getting predictable. Well directed and great script...some of the banter was really well done and made us all giggle.

The set pieces containing flashbacks and hallucinations were very very well done. I've read some reviews about a so called silly ending, bur for me I thought the ending was in the vain of the movie.

It brought back to me last years Blair Witch with the camera- work..did i see that? ..what was that ?? Very well done indeed. Well worth a trip with your partner as they will be clung to you from the off set. Will keep an eye on the director for more. I gave it a 6 and not a 7 because of the ending..it wasn't silly but maybe could have explained a bit more."
The Ritual,Into the Forest,"So going off wandering might not always be the best idea. Especially if you have some baggage to carry (pun intended). And while we do get some flashbacks and some backstory to the characters and their motivation to go on that trip, some may feel like the rest of the story is detached from that. Don't get me wrong, it has quite a few moments, it is shocking and it is tension filled, which might make you sit at the edge of your seat.

There is also the moral question and the what would you have done (that's for the inciting incident, the one that is the reason for their predicament in the first place)? It is a tough question to answer for some, though even those who may say different might have acted exactly the same way. The ending is maybe a little bit of a let down, but technically this is sound to say the least ..."

The Ritual,A breath of fresh air...,"I don't remember ever reviewing a movie here, but I decided to come at the rescue of this movie... I really enjoyed this movie and I go against the reviews which once more put it in the ""average around 6.0 score"" where so many other scary movies are standing. I consider myself a horror/scary amateur and I have seen many movies of this kind, and since the last 10 years, its getting harder to find some that makes you say ""ok, this was a bit different"".... (of course there are some, but in my opinion over the large quantity, only over 20% are passing the ""not too bad"" test""). For once, we don't have to bear some stupid teenagers partying for spring break in the forest, some people behaving so stupidly that you think ""seriously ??"", a haunted house, a possession, or a redneck hillbilly family... Here the movie has a lot of a ""realistic"" touch to it, the characters are normal and they could be us, normal people behaving normally in the face of danger and fear and that reinforce the attachment for the characters. Many times I wondered, ""damn, i dont know what I would have done in this situation"". The mood is nicely growing more and more stressing and not much of the ""monster"" is shown for a long time, letting the viewer finding out slowly about the real horror happening in those woods. The change of scenery (Swedish forest) and the isolation of the characters reinforce the idea that nature in itself can be scary and that even a friendly country like Sweden can appear in another light... The last quarter of the movie is a bit more conventional to the genre but still not falling in all the clichés. I especially raise a thumb up for the creature design and the explanation on what it is. Probably not all will approve, but I liked the way this was going and when learning what the creature really was, I wondered ""would I try to fight against that or give up ?""

So yeah, this movie is not THE movie of the year for me, but for sure, it is totally over many of the ""i watch and I forget"" movie that I've been seing in horror recently. I recommend."
The Ritual,Above average low budget horror movie,"Less is often more. In The Ritual, this is so true as the wilderness, the forest and creepy sounds are what create the tension. The effects are few, but effective. Four men go on a hike and end up somewhere in the deepest forests in Sweden, only to discover that something evil awaits them there. The first half of the movie is really good. The end not as good but decent. Unfortunately, the film is not shot in Sweden but in Romania, which I think is a shame because I myself am Swedish and immediately saw that nature does not look at all like in Sweden. But overall it is better than average low budget horror movies and worth watching."
The Ritual,"Great first hour, but the last 30 mins are so disappointing",Comentario no disponible
The Ritual,One of the most tense and exhilarating films I've watched in a long while,"The key to any good horror film has always been having characters that are realistic and that the audience can relate to and care for. Yet so many horror films completely overlook this element in their film. 'The Ritual' does not make this mistake. These characters are highly flawed, but they're also relatable and we as an audience can understand (if not fully agree with) choices and decisions they've made. I suspect a lot of this stems from the fact that 'The Ritual' was based on a novel as the source material. Movies based on novels almost always contain more depth to their characters for obvious reasons.

So you've got yourself a set of great characters, but that still isn't enough to guarantee a successful film. You now have the obligation to utilise those characters you've created. 'The Ritual' ticks that box as well. Firstly, it's a great looking film. They did a fantastic job picking the setting for the film. Creepy and atmospheric, whilst beautiful and endearing at the same time. Secondly, this film ticks possibly the rarest box a horror movie is ever able to achieve these days, which is to be scary. I almost never get any rise in my heart-rate during a horror film any more, but that was certainly not the case here. I was invested in the story and the suspense had me on edge.

The first 3/4 of the film are some of the best mystery, suspense, horror film watching I've done in years. This film was almost destined for greatness, but unfortunately the final 1/4 does let things a slip a bit. Once any mystery is gone from the story things lose steam a little and everything becomes a little stock-standard. The ending is quite abrupt too, and I had hoped for a little more. Altogether though I certainly recommend giving this film a watch. It's about as good as modern horror films come."

The Ritual,"Okay, but it could have been better",Comentario no disponible
The Ritual,"Stunning, visceral, and intense.","The Ritual is an atmospheric folk lore horror akin to 2015's ""The VVitch,"" or Bruckner's debut film set in Terminus, 2007's ""The Signal.""

A superb viewing that mounts tension without long, dragged out environmental shots or minutes of expository; instead, Ritual relies on the innate human fears of getting lost in a foreign place to craft a sense of dread that is all too palpable.

There is a wonderful backdrop crafted in Ritual, wrought from ancient Elder Futhark and a devastatingly delicious dose of Proto-Norse mythos.

Genre buffs looking for a cerebral treat that doesn't need to be spoonfed will enjoy every minute of the Ritual, with an ending that provides answers but still leaves a sense of ambiguity large enough that the viewer can draw their own conclusions.

This is a masterclass in psychological terror; Bruckner has outdone himself with The Ritual and I expect this title to cement his worthiness as a visual story teller in stone. Ignore the ""Blair Witch"" copycat comments -- The Ritual is a superior movie in every conceivable way."

The Ritual,"Awesome horror movie, truly creepy","I don't understand the 2 star ratings here. This is a solid horror movie. I was truly creeped out the whole time, which is what I look for in a horror.

Yeah it's not perfect, but it is WAY better than the Blair Witch project. As a horror fan I give this a 9/10. Not because it is a perfect movie, but because I found it so unsettling, weird, and well, scary.

Don't look for logic, just surrender yourself and be afraid!"
The Ritual,I Loved This...,"If you enjoyed films like Trollhunter, Thale etc you should get a kick from this. Four British lads on a hiking trek through Sweden to pay tribute to a departed mate who has been murdered at the start of the film in an off licence robbery. The story has a slight Blair Witch feel to the discovery of the carved runes in the trees as the group soon get lost in a forest. With most of my reviews I do not want to spoil the movie so I try to keep my comments brief and spoiler free. This film plays heavily on how damned creepy forests can be..even in daylight..and combines this with the concept of ancient nature elemental's/demons or gods...The acting is very natural which makes the group of friends feel familiar..like your own mates. I recommend this..but insist you view films the way that I do for full affect..view alone, in the dark..on a 42"" screen..sitting between stereo speakers or surround sound if you have it. That is the ONLY way to view any movie to be able to fully appreciate it. Make your viewing a ritual and you should enjoy 'The Ritual'."

The Ritual,"The woodlands are a sight to see and have a very alienating feel that tells you that you are never safe, no matter if its daylight or night.","The film is about a group of friends who go trekking in the Swedish forests to honour their dead friend's wish. I got enticed due to the trailer n the director's name was sufficient for me. Have enjoyed David Bruckners films. (The Signal 2007, Siren, Southbound). Saw this on a rented dvd. The film captured the eerie nature of the forest so well, it becomes the most important character in the film. The creepiness n sense of dread in the broad daylight n the surrealistic nightmare sequences in the nighttime added solid tensions. The dream sequences in the cabin was truly nightmarish. The suspense is maintained throughout. This film makes getting lost in the woods scary all over again. The woodlands are a sight to see and have a very alienating feel that tells you that you are never safe, no matter if its daylight or night."
The Ritual,"Makes you want to go camping in Sweden, or NOT.","It's not the first movie that we all saw before with people wandering in the woods where something is definitely wrong. So the story might be a bit cliché but the execution was good. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, that I thought was completely overrated, you also have people in the woods and the supposition of something evil watching them. In The Blair Witch Project you will never get an answer nor see the thing that freightened everybody and that was a major letdown, plus it was not filmed good at all. Supposition of evil in horror movies is good, in the right ambiance, but at one point you have to see the evil force in real to be satisfied. In The Ritual you get that and that's a bonus. The acting was good, all characters added something to the story. A story that is creepy enough for a horror/thriller. To me it could have used a bit more blood to make it scarier, but that's just me. The best way to watch this movie would be at night in the middle of the woods somewhere in Sweden."

The Boy,My Antidote to Marvel and Co.,Having being all superheroed out with the never ending train of films this is so much welcome relief. It's not for kids and I love the choice language which is appropriate.
The Boy,It's 4am,"Started watching this brilliant spin on a superhero show after dinner. Now it's 4 am and I have just watched the whole thing.

From the very first episode I was glued to this exciting, interesting and crazy ride."
The Boy,It's exactly the opposite of your usual superhero show!,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching."

The Boy,Unexpected,"Excellent dystopian reimagining for Superhero nerds. Surprising, violent, always twisting. Binge-watched in 2 days! So glad for a second season, though will be so impatient! Thumbs up."
The Boy,"Amazon pulled off a ""Netflix"" spectacularly !",Comentario no disponible
The Boy,Definitly one of the best series this year,"First it's just a very interesting take on the whole superhero genre. But there's also a lot more. Great actors, great storyline and very nice picture. I guess for me it's the best superhero series yet, followed by Titans and Umbrella Academy."
The Boy,"Just... Wow. Dark, funny and gripping.",Just finished watching the four first episodes. The pilot has to be one of greatest pilots I've ever seen. It has everything and I was hooked immideately. And it keeps getting better. I didn't know I needed this. It's really bold and a fresh wind for TV.
The Boy,About time,With all these awful shows like supergirl and legends of tomorrow etc..The Boys is the perfect antidote to that insipid moralistic tripe that's spewed our TVs so thank you Amazon Prime for treating us like adults and I can't wait for the second season
The Boy,Awesome!,"There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!"
The Boy,Excellent!!,"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!"
The Boy,"Violence, depth and American values right in your face!!",Comentario no disponible
The Boy,S1-3 are great. 4 is a disgrace.,"Predictable. One shocking scene after another. This is the layziest writing and directing ever. Talking heads, bs dialogs and constantly people sitting and talking. And talking. No dynamic. This season is so off, it looks like they cut the budget in half. If it wasn't for some effects this would be really impossible to watch. The quality dropped so much that it is not worth wasting time and energy.

The family story lines are boring and feel like time fillers. The characters are off and lame. Even the new ones. The pretend like we know them, but we don't. And why would you care? There is so much implausible stuff in this season.. I don't even know where to start."
The Boy,This show fell off really hard,"The boys started really well, but from the last episode of season 3, the show has been going downhill. The story has stopped progressing, and the creators are only adding stuff to generate shocking reactions from viewers. Unfortunately, this isn't working anymore. Weird scenes looked good when the story was moving forward, but now that it isn't, I am just unable to watch it anymore. The performances of all the actors are good, but the writing has been really bad. The characters are making weird choices that don't match their personalities, and the attempt to stretch things out is very visible on screen. All in all, The Boys has fallen off."
The Boy,Super hero reality check in affect,Want to see what it would really be like with super heroes around? Check this out! No kids play here folks....not for kids. Best damn series on right now....about time!
The Boy,A superior 'Superhero' series,"This Amazon series is set in a world where there are superheroes; they aren't typical superheroes though; they work for the powerful Vought Corporation and consider ratings and profit to be more important than saving lives. They are also arrogant, disillusioned or generally unpleasant. The worst of these are 'The Seven', the most senior heroes who are heavily marketed by Vought. Working to expose them is a group known as 'The Boys'; led by Billy Butcher who is convinced that leader of the heroes, Homelander, is responsible for the disappearance of his wife. We are introduced to each group via new members; Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after ultrafast hero A-Train ran through his girlfriend; and Annie January an idealistic young heroine known as Starlight who joins The Seven. Hughie and Annie become friends before learning what the other is doing.

When I first heard of this I thought it was just a case of Amazon jumping on the superhero bandwagon but then heard a radio review which made it sound like a series I might like... it most certainly is! If you like your heroes to be heroic and good rather than self-centred egomaniacs you might not like this but if you like to see conventions turned on their head this is great. Another major difference between this and more typical stories featuring superheroes is that this is definitely not family friendly; there is a lot of strong violence, some sex and nudity and possibly the most swearing I've heard in a TV show. The story develops well over the two seasons that are currently available with some good twists and plenty of interesting character development. The characters on both sides are interesting and the cast does a great job portraying them. While the story can be a bit dark at times it is lightened by its humour; often being genuinely hilarious as we see events that wouldn't seem the most obvious source of laughs. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to older superhero fans who are looking for something different. I can't wait for season three."
The Boy,Big things for Homelander,"Can't say I recall seeing Anthony Star in any films (and I'm an Aussie) but his performance as Homelander is really something else - someone give him an award. Can't wait for next season, and more projects with Star."
The Boy,Check it out. You will be surprised.,Great twist on the superhero genre. The story is well written. The acting is good. Definitely an entertaining series.
The Boy,A Super Series,"When I first heard of 'The Boys', I thought it would be your standard superhero series, but when I actually watched it, I discovered I was dead wrong. After 15 minutes of the first episode, it was impossible to stop watching. It was a more believable take on what the world would look like if superheroes were flying around today, with characters that were unforgettably unique. There were times when I thought that the 'good guys' were the 'bad guys', and times when I thought the 'bad guys' were the 'good guys'. But in the end, I found that there weren't any 'all-good' or 'all-bad' characters, but 'all-human' characters, sometimes with more-than-human abilities. It's a super series, definitely worth your time."

The Boy,Ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-nannas!,"EXCELLENT first season.

Incredibly, an even better second season."
The Boy,How I imagine Superheroes would really be!,"Give a celebrity super powers and you have The Boys. Narcisistic and arrogant. Above the law. Of course I enjoy Marvel and DC, but honestly, they are unrealistic. If Supes were real, this is how they would act. Sure, you would have a handful of good ones, but the majority would do what they wanted. The Boys shows the real and darker side of humanity. Our current celebrities consider themselves better than everyone else, and if you gave them super powers, then just imagine how they would behave. On the outside they would appear good, but behind closed doors their true colors would show. Well, ""The Boys"" know this and they are bent on taking down the Supes and showing their true colors. Like I said, if Supes were real, this is how I imagine it would be. Did I mention Karl Urban? Stellar performance. And Anthony Starr as Homelander is fabulous(Superman meets Captain America meets Arrogant Superstar). If you want a realistic look into Superheroes, then watch The Boys."
The Boy,"Season 1 and 2 are fire, 3 is okay, 4 is total TRASH","Season 4 of The Boys is close to unwatchable.

Violence and gore are ok as long as they're justified and part of the plot, in season 4, it feels like it's there just to A, fill up the time and B, because the writers are simply deranged

But the biggest problem, as many other viewers point out, is that it is way too political

Hollywood and Hollywood-adjacent screenwriters and showrunners need to understand that the audience does not want political views shoved down their throat

I guess it's going to take a few more years, box office bombs and scathing reviews for them to understand it, but they'll get there in the end

hopefully."
The Boy,R.I.P. The Boys...,"It's a sad year for The Boys.. What started as a captivating and entertaining show, has devolved into a painful hour of viewing each week. I could easily binge the first 2 seasons seasons (and even season 3 for the most part)... but the subtle & clever political undertones of earlier seasons, which were an afterthought to the storyline & character building, has become the sole purpose of the show now it seems. I barely get through each new episode, but continue to hold on in the hopes of some kind of glimpse of The Boys seasons I fell in love with in the first place. There are still a few good scenes and humor sprinkled in, but it's mostly just the writer shoving their extreme political view down your throat every chance they get. It's becoming predictable and very repetitive at this point. I hope things will start to get better, and I'll most likely tough it out for the remainder of the season as something to put on in the background while I'm doing other stuff, but if it continues this trajectory, I won't be around for season 5 (if it even gets there)."
The Boy,Fairly unique,"Bad superheroes have been done before, but not like this. Very entertaining."

Simon Calls,Garbage,"This is probably the stupidest movie ever made. It has minimal dialog, a non-existent script and seriously bad acting. It was clearly made on a shoestring budget, and might only appeal to a local audience. The scenes have little or no continuity and for the first half hour of the film, there are probably less than fifty words spoken. The film is a pointless one and one can only imagine why it has even reached a streaming site. On the off chance that there is a story hidden in this garbage, it is well hidden and will never be found by the average viewer. Why such poorly produced films are made is beyond comprehension."

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Michael Lang no longer smells like roses after this,"So Michael Lang, the organizer of the original Woodstock, sells his soul, if he ever had one, to help put on what he hopes will be a money-making Woodstock II in Rome, NY. The lesson being that we are idealists when young, but realists when we grow up. Unfortunately he and his partners were out of touch with the young people who showed up in 1999, who felt robbed by expensive food and disrespected by ""the man."" Lang went from hippie to ""the man."" In the end, this documentary does not tell us if W2 made money, but to many of the attendees it was the event of a lifetime, despite the chaos. Based on this three episode docu, I'm glad I wasn't there."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,A bit better than the previous doc,"Slightly longer than last year's ""Woodstock: Peace Love and Rage"" documentary, and the 3-episode chronological format (covering each day) works better and seems more focused. As another reviewer pointed out, this could've been several episodes longer, or at least longer than 45 mins an episode; for anyone who listened to music critic Steven Hyden's 10-episode podcast in 2019 (""Break Stuff: The Story of Woodstock 99"") both of these documentaries seem lightweight by comparison. But in the end, I guess there's only so much available footage to use and people to interview.

And to the reviewers who said they never mention Woodstock 94 or blame the organizers instead of the bands, what documentary were you watching? 94 is mentioned in the first episode, and the organizers are painted throughout as being ignorant to the many problems happening, and then spinning the truth for damage control and refusing to accept any blame in the aftermath."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Enthralling Documentary,"I happened across this documentary by accident, and being a huge music fan, I was intrigued by the subject. What unfolded was more of a statement of the social status of the US at the time than the music scene. The thing I took away from this was the unbelievable naivety of the organisers, the lack of understanding of the current music scene and the rampant capitalism of the licenced vendors. Back in the '60s, the music scene was all peace and love and hippies. Hendrix, Lennon, Crosby Stills and Nash, Santana. All mellow stuff. Cut to post grunge USA, the music is angry, violent and aggressive. Korn, Limp Bizkit, Chilli Peppers, Rage Against The Machine. Add to that the appalling facilities, price gouging for food and drink and the 100c + weather. It is almost an A-Z of how not to organise a rock festival. The scenes of 300,000 people undulating to Limp Bizkit on stage is mesmerising, and must have been intoxicating for the artists. The organisers seem to ty and deflect blame on the artists for getting the crowd over excited, particularly Korn, Limp Biskitz and RHCP. That is literally their job FFS! Recommended viewing for any music fans, or anyone interested in the Mob Rules mentality."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,"No rules, it's a wild story.","Woodstock conjures up images of peace, love and unity, Woodstock 99 however conjures up very different images.

Here you'll see what people will do when they're pushed to extremes, those behind this event set this up, wound people up, ripped them off, and failed to control the subsequent fallout.

Incredibly well made with some amazing and shocking footage. Surprising interviews, some of what you'll hear would make Pinocchio look honest.

It's an interesting look at the generation of the time, it may just give you an insight into where we're at in 2022.

Enjoy it for the music, you'll be reminded of some of the amazing tunes from the 90's, an incredible era musically.

The biggest shock comes at the end of Part 3, a very sad moment, sad end to the series.

Well worth watching, 8/10."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,"Super insightful, insane footage, and some still-outdated perspectives! [+72%]","Ahh, the late '90s. Such a wild time. The rise of nu metal and the rising popularity of alt rock. That was the first time I got introduced to the likes of RHCP, KoRn, Limp Bizkit, and all those names. At a time when popular music was perceived to be soft (and focused primarily on positive feelings alone), these guys who screamed at the top of their lungs delving into deep, inner levels of anguish and distress became more relatable to the average youngster. Back then, there were no smartphones or social media where you incessantly receive validation from. Life was simpler, but it was also still heavily focused around the male gaze (in everything pop culture - and music was no different).

Now, we can't blame the team of Woodstock in their attempt to revive a classic music festival which symbolized peace, love, and harmony in trying times. But the makers of this three-part documentary run us through the finer details - we get to know early on that Woodstock '99 was never meant to work in the first place because it was an attempt at cash-grab with no real sense of organization, safety, security, personal hygiene, or sanitation. You can put big names on a poster and expect people to attend in droves, though no one would remember a show if the music alone was decent.

What makes a days-long concert memorable is firstly of course, the music and its presentation (stage setup, sound systems, pyro etc.). Then comes the F&B, decent sanitary facilities and so on. But more importantly, you coming out alive and healthy at the end of it all is what matters the most (Astroworld and many recent incidents come to mind). Woodstock '99 probably only worked in one aspect alone - getting thousands of people to a single spot all in the name of music (and drugs, and hopes of getting laid, etcetera). Everything else seems like a natural clusterfuck - the choice of location, the ultra expensive food & beverages, the main acts themselves which were focused around riling people up (than calming them down), the lack of a proper security system, and riotous crowds acting like they were ready to raise hell any moment.

It's insane to still see part of the Woodstock team (the OGs i.e.) continuing to blame a few bad apples and not admit how criminally chaotic things got. I'm glad the documentary brings these things to light with crazy footage, insights from people who ran the event and who attended it, and also including the perspective of some of the musicians (good to see you, JD!). If you watched the more recent Fyre Festival documentary and found that amusing, then this one will certainly grab your interest and maybe, even make you look up more content on this infamous event."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,The Fyre Festival that happened...,"It develops as an apocalypse anouncement. The conditions of this festival resemble a mix between Mad Max and Spring Breakers. The sexual agressiveness and the hate that you see in those images are overwhelming.

A good watch for those who want to organise a festival on what NOT to do and what is crucial to have onsite.

And just because Woodstock is in the title it does not mean the crowd are hippies... The organisers were so naive and Lang was so careless and uninterested."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,More to it than that!,"They didn't touch on the lack of resources enough- clean toilets and showers! By day two we left and found a place to shower at a local park; just couldn't take it anymore! And even though we paid for the entire event, we could never find a way back in. They had it all sealed off. After driving in circles for hours, we gave up and angrily left.

Maybe that was a blessing in disguise after seeing the horrors of day 3.

And they were correct on the ridiculous prices. Most of us were under 30 and didn't have a fortune to spend on simple bites to eat and waters.

These promoters really should be ashamed of themselves, but they obviously won't take the blame."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Good documentary,Comentario no disponible
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Fascinating tale of when greed and incompetence destroy something beautiful,"The original Woodstock was a cultural turning point, Woodstock 99 was also a turning point but in the opposite direction.

It's clear from the start that Lang doesn't know what he's doing and that it was only will hardwork of his 3 partners for the original Woodstock that it actually work. Without them Woodstock 99 failed.

John Scher defending all the rapes (especially of children) was just sickening, what an absolute disgrace of a human being.

The tried to capture the hippy magic of the original but then decided to play metal/rock/aggressive musics/bands, so obviously that's not going to bring in a hippy band. They you don't do the festival in a field/farm, the idiots decide to do it on asphalt in 40C heat. Banning drinking being brought in was ridiculous and letting a bottle of water go for $15 (in today's money) was just an absolute joke. No wonder people were kicking off.

The original Woodstock wasn't about money and it had even less regulations and security. People were giving out their food and drink for free. Woodstock 99 you'd be lucky to get a slice of bread for less than $5.

I'm glad they didn't do any other Woodstocks after this as Lang clearly was riding on the coattails of his original peers, and the greedy corporates pigs as responsible for it's death. Thank God Glastonbury still knows how to do it right."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Good Documentary - BAD Event,"The documentary is good - but the event itself - was just a massive failure on soooo many levels! Everyone from the artists, to the promoters, to the fans - all pitched in together to create a massive embarrassment, and a shameful event! There's nothing good that can be said about Woodstock 99 - it's just a terrible example of human greed and depravity!!!"
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Well presented but still missing content.,Comentario no disponible
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,So what happened after?,"After nearly three hours of seeing what a train wreck the festival was you would think there would be info about what happened afterwards. Who cleaned the the mess? How much did they make? Were there any lawsuits? Arrests? Deaths? Etc... Nope , not one bit of info except for the promoter died three months after the documentary was filmed."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Not quite the documentary of the century,"Let's just say it right now and get it over with - Trainwreck: Woodstock 99 is easily one of the best documentaries Netflix nas come up with in recent years; it's partly because most of those has been utter crap, but in a way, Trainwreck can really hold up its own. And if you're a fan of seeing things go south (and you are, aren't you, why else would you be here?), then you'll enjoy every bit of this one.

But of course, Oscar for best documentary short contender this one is not. And it isn't for the lack of trying - it's properly produced, nicely put together, with a clear vision almost till the end. Because -much like the event it's trying to portray- it's towards the end where things really start to fall apart. Are there repercussions? Ramifications? What do we really feel about the festival, 20+ years later? Have we learned anything or, was this documentary -again, much like the event- just an excuse to see s#it burn? Is saying, no plans for another Woodstock, really it?

A good documentary is a pure and simple art form - it's a music piece, an opera. It must come together effortlessly and it must make sense from the start till the end - here, you're left with an unfinished symphony. Unless this has always been the idea. Much unlike the even it's trying to portray."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,A good example of human nature,"I write apocalyptic fiction so I love documentaries that show how how quickly people give in to that animalistic nature. My husband and I often go back-and-forth about things like this because I think people are basically bad and will flip pretty quickly given the right circumstances and he thinks people are basically good. I thought this was a fantastic example of how quickly people can switch to an animalistic/selfish violent nature and it really does validate all of the books I've written about the apocalypse and how people will react.

Secondly, I don't believe there are so few sexual assaults. I think thousands of women were sexually assaulted during this train wreck of a weekend a c just didn't report it. I cannot begin to imagine the trauma that has come out of this event."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Not for the faint hearted,"The documentary itself I found good, lots of original footage. Well told, from few angles and the story is pretty self explanatory as is written in other reviews how messed up it was. Missed some people taking responsibility but hey what else was new. It was my first time watching something about the Woodstock festivals, so don't have anything to compare it to. But wow the images are intense and I could feel the adrenaline just from watching it, found it quite scary. 3 episodes is enough."

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Solid but limited,"A look at Woodstock 99 and the hell that went down after the show ending.

This does a solid job of looking at the ill fated Woodstock 99 from inception to building to execution, interviewing lots of people and with lots of archival footage. What it doesn't do well is follow the actual timelines of band performances, ignores huge acts and fudges a few facts to place more blame of a few people and not others. Like how come nobody even mentioned Rage Against the Machine when people were literally chanting their lyrics during the riot?

Also, talking about Fight Club, which came out well after this show was a little disingenuous.

Overall though a good doc about greed and corporate ruin."

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,A Compelling Look at This Trainwreck,"A compelling look at the 1999 Rome NY attempt to revitalize Woodstock 30 years later. Some great interviews from John Scher, Michael Lnag, Ananda Lewis, Jewel, and more. Terrific footage of the original Woodstock, the 94' flop, and this crazy event. I generally think most documentaries today are too long, but this one seems to have enough to hold your interest, especially if you are from the MTV era. While they keep calling this concert Woodstock I don't see to as Woodstock. I see it as an imposter-trying to capitalize on the nostalgia of the original. I am not sure why I do not remember the details of this disaster but this movie did bring back a lot of memories from the era."

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,How not to make a festival guide,"I've heard before that W'99 was a failure and that Limp Bizkit was framed for that. My worst dreams I couldn't have predicted how bad it really was and how incompetent and greedy organizers can be.

The 3 episodes are a collection of failure after failure from start to finish, and what the consequences you may expect of every stupid decision. I don't understand how Michael Lang and especially John Scher avoided imprisonment for what they did. Their combined mindset of stupidity and greed concluded as a hell on earth event and throught the entire document they haven't acknowledge pity once.

There are some fantastic interviews although I feel there's a lot missing. Out of the provided I would say the highlights are Scott for filmig the last night events, Cody for the peace patrol perspective, Sara for honesty from start to finish and Lee Rosenblatt as the biggest voice of reason for the management.

Polish Woodstock rip off (Przystanek Woodstock currently called Pol'and'Rock, as they no longer have rights to refer to the original name) which takes place since 1995, and for years now gathers 400k+ attendants, has it's own imperfections and accidents. No brainer for that scale of the event. My point is that it is possible to make it work and provide a safe environment for everybody including children. Instead Woodstock 99 is now a guide HOW NOT TO make a festival.

Going back to Limp Bizkit. After watching one and a half episodes you can already see how bad things were. So David Blaustein mentioning that Fred Durst's ego fumed the crowd was the biggest lie of the entire document and made me question everything else he said. What was the standard Limp Bizkit performance for years, somehow got framed as provocative at the event. This document is clearly missing some words from Fred Durst himself. Every other artist interviewed, mention that they were not told what is going on.

Putting any blame on the attendants, weather, lineup is just disgusting. I have a lot of questions regarding other things, such us how it is possible that people were refused to bring in their water, while so many drugs made it to the festival. How the water supply got mixed up with feces. How big of an idiot you have to be, to even think that giving candles and fire to drunk and drugged people, sounds like a good idea. And why Sara was not allowed to answer whether she would attend the event once again.

Huge props for a lot of camera footage, but same as the interviews, I believe there is a lot content they were not allowed to show us."
Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Sooooooo many things left out,"I'm still trying to understand how HBO managed to make a better general and FULL portrait of the event in 1h50min than Netflix in three episodes.

First of all, how on earth did they not even mention the fact that Metallica was there? I actually thought I had dreamt about that. Also, almost disturbing how small the range of opinions and various testimonials is considering how many people there were and are still alive today. The festival was an awesome idea of course, and a bunch of people would do it again, but I feel like the mini-series completely and, to be honest, shamefully missed the point... What's important to understand is that, probably not coincidentally, this docu-series is coming out at a moment this has recently just happened again at the Astroworld Festival with a way younger crowd and multiple deaths. I still personally enjoy festivals but they absolutely failed to say that THIS is what started the festival fever we all have today, they simply are separated by genres now to make it manageable.

I love Netflix's documentaries for its deep research and honest take on things that most ""mainstream"" documentaries don't dare to do, but this isn't one of them for me. I was extremely uncomfortable to see how much attention they gave to the organizers instead of the people who lived it in many many many different ways. Countless women were raped, many people hospitalized and at least one person died... Again, I don't understand how HBO could very decently and respectfully present this full portrait of the event in way less time. I feel like, especially in three 45 min episodes, it was their responsibility to make a clear connexion between events that are still unfortunately happening today; especially for victims of crowd stampede, asphyxiation and heat exhaustion who's lives were taken because of the greed that is behind these festivals. Sure, Micheal Lang is a legend, but what about the people? I mean, if you're not going to tell the whole thing, why bother even trying to explain it from just 1-2 point of views?

Anyways, that's my opinion. I'm happy to have discovered Korn through the tellings of this event :)"

Trainwreck: Woodstock '99,Michael Lang and John Scher are disgusting human beings,"I loved this documentary, it was so insightful into the tragedy of Woodstock 99'. The production was great and I finished it in one night it was that good.

I am, however, so angry over how Lang and Scher blamed the whole event on the poor behaviours of some of the crowd, when in truth it was them that was to blame.

The mistreatment of the crowd over the course of three days was appalling and even now (over 20 twenty years later) both Lang and Scher still don't recognise that the ones who are to blame are them. They were not prepared for a crowd of 250,000 people."

Missing: The Other Side,I'm hoping for many more seasons!!!,"Phenomenal series!!! If you're a fan of the supernatural you'll have to watch this. The show is an emotional roller-coaster as you come to know the individual ""dead"" characters. While you will hope for their killers to be caught and their bodies to be found, you will feel heart broken when it happens. I wasn't sure where they would go for Season 2, after the way Season 1 ended, but they pulled it off. It turned out just as good as season 1. If anything, Season 2 was probably even a little bit more mysterious but no less enjoyable. In addition to a great story, the show is filmed beautifully and has gorgeous nature shots and scenery. I am hoping for many more."
Missing: The Other Side,Great Drama. One of the best drama in 2020!!!,Comentario no disponible
Missing: The Other Side,From the other side is a great idea,"Loved season one 10/10 scenary, story line, emotions were all on point.

Season too, I get it, you lost a daughter stop brooding all over through the seasons. The old man in this season was exhausting to watch, looking miserable and really not helping to find anyone, fifthe episode of 2nd season, I just forward his scenes. Jeez men, move on, honour your baby with finding all the other babies stuck there.... The script writer lost it on the old man in this season.

Wook and the rest are brilliant as usual.

The usual Korean threatening faces and boastful walks and eishhhhhh and it's driving me crazy hahaha.

Great story all in all."
Missing: The Other Side,Beautifully written,A ghost show but not scary show. This make you smile. The whole cast is soo good and I liked each and every character. For me it was beautiful imagination of the writer. A missing dead people staying in mysterious village until someone found the body. And two main character can see them and help them. That was really a good imagination. I liked second season as well hopefully we can get the third season also It will be amazing. Unfortunately this kind of drama doesn't get recongnization from the people because there is no hot actor in the series according to them and no kissing scenes so they won't even tried to watch it.

I love all the actors, they are funny and know what they are doing."
Missing: The Other Side,Refreshing,"It's an amazing concept. Watched the first season on Netflix and waiting for the more seasons to come. I really loved Mr. Jang's character, what a beautiful way to portray for father's endless love and their quest. It's a breath of fresh air when you see most of the K-dramas revolve around some sort of a love story. Although this too has bit n pieces of love story, but that's not all of it, which is the thing to love about this show. Highly recommend it.

There were some characters which did not make any sense at all. They were there for one or two episodes with no real need or justification, for instance Jong Ah's friend. But other than that it was a smooth ride."
Missing: The Other Side,"Roller coaster of emotional ride, familiar plot & beautiful scenes","Not bad. Great storyline something similar that ive crossed with multiple times especially on animes and other series that i cant think of the name, but definitely familiar. Great line of casts although im not familiar with not even of them. Beautiful sceneries and really great graphics. Looks every clean and tone of the series was very bright and cheerful despite having a depressing/sad plot. Average sound scores, nothing extraordinary (exception on emotional moments - very moving sounds). A huge fan of the natural sceneries. Very emotional, suspenseful/mysyery and great drama for the fantasy loving audiences. Highly recommended."
Missing: The Other Side,It's a 1000 out of 10🔥,"I cent percent recommend this drama, if you're a fan of seat edge thriller genre... You just watch the first few scene, you will automatically watch the whole series as soon as possible.... Bcoz, they have the fire to add into the fire in our heart.

The way the series was presented and the actors' determination, all of these factors made the drama in it's shape.

After each episode, I was like riding on a rollercoaster.

I could feel the emotions that the actors shown.

I laughed and cried with them. Even though it's a series, I was literally telling them, ""don't do this and that"" and ""don't cry"" like a crazy madman.

It's definitely a must watch series.."
Missing: The Other Side,Great idea but too slow,"Missing: The Other Side is similarly in concept to Hotel Del Luna., (which I absolutely loved). I really wanted to like this series, it had all the potential of a great series: ghosts, crime, mystery and hidden identity. However, the slower pace, drawn out plots, predictable character arcs and incoherent character stories lost a lot of points for me.

Missing became extremely dragging midpoint and some story points became fairly illogical (ie. Antagonist had the option to follow main character, choses not to but still ends up trying to trick him into a trap). These odd decisions leads the viewers in a long-winded route just to get back to the same spot.

The acting is great was the cast but the writing for the characters weren't as captivating as there was a lack of indepth development. Most of the character's main goal remains the same throughout and their decisions are made to prolong the series rather than logical.

There are many heartfelt moments in the series as certain characters moves on, but these moments were either dragged out or not developed enough.

If it had slightly faster pacing or less episode, it would have worked better."

Missing: The Other Side,MISSING: THE OTHER SIDE OR WAS IT THE FLIP SIDE,"I watched all 12 episodes on Netflix today, this is typical Korean TV or Movie Drama, where everyone cries throughout the series, the Men cry, the women cry, the children cry, everything and everybody cries but the dog, or maybe it was crying to, it's in almost every scene, after a while all that crying gets to be down right annoying, there's not that much drama in world. Aside from the tears and the bellyaching over any and everything, the series was worth watching, the plot was sound, the special effects they used on the ghost sequences was interesting. The acting for the most part was believable. Don't see why they would want to make a second season, all the fine points of this one was solved, there was nothing left. Please don't go back and rehash old plot lines. Let it stay missing, on the other side. If you are wondering if you should watch it, I say ... yeah, give it a try, if you'll not hooked by the third episode, then this series isn't for you, don't worry about bringing tissues, just mute the sound when all the crying start, it does tend to get on your nerves."
Missing: The Other Side,Have the tissues ready,"This is an awesome series in 12 neatly-written and directed episodes.

The number and diversity of characters was unusually large and their development fully fleshed-out. No 2-D characters here. The actors all did a fine job of presentation.

Has the plot been done before. Kind of, kind of not. There are very few totally original concepts these days. I don't judge a movie by concept, but by execution.

That said the one issue I had with the show was the core premise: that the dead could not ""move on"" because their bodies had not been found. That's a little hard to swallow, even if one believes in an afterlife. That odd premise remained a sore-thumb that for me affected the entire series.

Beyond that, be prepared for repeated tear-jerkers, emotional moments, subtle and enjoyable humor, and an overall well-done series."
Missing: The Other Side,The Mysterious Village in the Deep Deep Woods °8.3° °excellent° 💯%🔍,"For as much as I liked this show, I don't have much to say. In part, that's because not much can be said without spoiling something. I went into MTOS knowing nothing and I'm glad I did. The mysteries undergo a gradual-unravel. The viewer that comes into the show with even half of the answers is MISSING half of the fun.

MTOS follows a string of murders and missing persons - some new, some old, some very old. The viewer watches police as they investigate, and follows the families, friends and the victims themselves. It is utterly heartbreaking, yet it is lined with hope. It is a 2 season 2020 release, rated 89 on AWiki and consisting of 26 60ish-minute episodes. Currently, the very popular S2 is not available for streaming. S1 is just 12 episodes.

The acting is truly superb. Go Soo (Heart Surgeons, The Flower in Prison) is Kim Wook. He witnesses the abduction of a woman which makes him the next target of the gangsters - they saw him seeing what they did, and they don't like witnesses. He must run for his life and his running takes him to a very strange village.

Heo Joon Ho (Kingdom-8.3, Why Her?-8) plays Jang Pan Seok, a man who lives in the village. His life ended when his daughter was abducted over 15 years ago. He spends his time handing out fliers, visiting the police, and chasing leads - most of them false. Ahn So Hee (Thirty-Nine, Eulachacha Waikiki S2) plays Lee Jong Ah, one of Wook's coworkers. She is super-cool. Her part is cool, but the coolness really seems to the actress herself. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her. Ha Joon (Black Dog-8.2, Destined with You, Crazy Love-7.8) plays Shin Joon Ho, a cop who appears to have much more head than heart. Two residents of the village are Seo Eun Soo (Dr. Romantic, Duel, Chief Detective 1958) as Choi Yeo Na and Song Geon Hee (SKY Castle, Lovely Runner) as Thomas Cha. Ji Dae Han (Chicago Typewriter) really shines as Officer Baek Il Doo. I can't explain it, but midshow I realized that every line he uttered amused me immensely. I'm looking forward to seeing more of him as well. The director is Min Yeon HongInsider from Ugly Alert. The screenwriters are Ban Ki Ri from Who Are You and Witch's Romance, and Jung So Young - a first effort.

MTOS is more a crime thriller than anything else, but it is quite unique. While many horrible things happen, it somehow manages to send the viewer off strangely uplifted. It's a horrible world with horrible things going on all the time. We are blessed if we can find any decent companions with whom to brave the elements. Wook navigates heartbreaks while forming firm alliances with worthy allies. By the end, he's missing much less despite his losses. He is able to reconcile with his past and go forward as a better man. Would that each one of us could.

Hero Mask,So they gave this a second season...,"Wow, as far as Netflix animes go this one falls ridiculously short. Yeah it's beautifully done. Yeah it checks off a lot of boxes one would expect from NF animes but can't get past the crappy story line and the tired recycled, self smiling, maniacal bad guy that pops up in way too many animes Yeah I get it he's insane blah blah blah Just annoying at this point"
Hero Mask,Amazing Graphics,"I am 52 and I was tired of the same old garbage on TV. My nephew liked anime so I thought I would give it a try a year or so ago and, wow, was I amazed! I watch anime now most of the time, lol. Hundreds if not 1,000+ hours in the last year. Back to my review.....

The graphics in this are extremely well done! Probably some of the best I have seen to be honest. The eyes are bigger when a character wears glasses, reflections off car windows, the record player how the record spins around, all just spectacular! Graphics wise I would give this an 11. The action in this, fight scenes, I give and 8 to 8.5. The story line is okay but not great so I give it about a 7. Overall I gave it a 9 just how impressed I was about the graphics. It is a good show. I believe it is rated a bit low here.

Enjoy!"
Hero Mask,Unwatchable,"The story is pure gibberish and the pacing is brutal. You never come to care about a single character and it is hard to find anything that will keep you interested. Since I didn't find one after three episodes, I quit."
Hero Mask,People overreact,"People are so upset that it's nothing big and completely surprising. But it takes place in the REAL WORLD. It's also a Netflix original anime so you can't expect it to be the most amazing thing ever. Don't get me wrong stuff like Cyberpunk Edgerunners was amazing but the city already had a story behind it. They also get upset because the character design isn't the best but that's also the real world in the story. No one has natural bright pink hair. They just assume all anime's need to have some big power so something. It's also a mystery story so people are upset it's ""not special"" as I said. That's like being upset because a fantasy story has elves, dragons and dwarves."

Angry Birds Toons,A true Angry Birds classic... this deserves a Season 4.,"Recently watched all of the episodes (well, almost.) and was a stunning blastoff. I've watched the 1st episode while I was 9 back in 2013, and now 9 years later, it is still the best show in Angry Birds history.

This deserves a fourth season if Rovio renews it, I can't wait to see more in the future. Loved it.

Instant 10 stars!"

Angry Birds Toons,Best Three Minute Show EVER!!!,"This was a well-executed show about angry birds unlike other modern angry birds shows,

each episode is well written (mostly season 1), and each character is cool and unique like how Matilda is very nice, and Chuck is fast and wants to show that he is a hero and Terence is just AWESOME!!!

I would defiantly recommend watching this mainly because it is only three minutes long.

The animation is beautiful, and it gets even better in newer seasons."
Angry Birds Toons,Fine Show,"I watched this when I was really little, and it was a fun show to watch. It isn't great or anything, but it's a solid how. Recommend watching if you enjoy angry birds stuff."
Angry Birds Toons,Angry Birds Toons,"I think Angry Birds Toons has some lame episodes but at least it's good. This is because Angry Birds Toons have most violent episodes, not very violent but interesting. As says on Wikipedia, the episodes are getting interesting.

It's interesting, some violence but a good cartoon series for children. Not very funny but worth the while of watching. For all ages maybe.

The quality which gotten better I really like the most because you can see what the characters are doing in full HD content.

There are plans for Rovio company that a season 2 is coming out. I hope their are more violence, maybe fighting but no silliness on it which I don't like"
Angry Birds Toons,i like amgry bird,"I used to have this on I think dvd? Its always been really good and i rewatch some episodes every once in awhile. The way they adapted a simple mobile game (and i guess they also took inspiration from the nat geo book) into this is great. This is one of those shows where you can FEEL the artists behind it, and you can tell they actually really cared. They adapted the characters really well, and their personalities all work really well together. The blues are now mischevious little triplets instead of a bird splitting into three which is a great idea, chuck is all hyperactive and careless cause hes fast, red is... just an angry bird. Matilda is all motherly and nice (cause she lays eggs i guess) but goes crazy sometimes, terence just sits there and grunts menacingly (kinda like in the ab movie if youve seen that) and bomb is the obligatory dumb one. Just a really fun little show."
B. A. Pass 2,Bad and unrealistic story,"I find this movie as waste of time. Worse then Part 1. Story is really bad, very bad. Any girl even who has mistakenly slept or married to a guy whom she don't want, how could she went with her to meet his family and stay there for few days.

I cannot understand the way it showed that she never practiced for acting despite of getting many chances.

Overall - Bad acting, VERY BAD STORY and direction is ok.

Please save your time by NOT watching it. I already wasted mine."
B. A. Pass 2,Worst movie ever,I couldn't understand how can it get even 2.4 stat. I just made an account on IMDb to review. Disgusting. You will hate yourself after watching this for wasting your time. How can someone even make a movie on this crap.worst piece of video I have ever seen.
B. A. Pass 2,"Don't waist your time, Please __/\__","I went to counsellor after watching this movie. After few sessions, I got courage to watch a movie again.

B. A. Pass 2,A Spoiled Young Woman Faces Reality,"""Neha Singh"" (Kritika Sachdeva) is a young and rather spoiled woman who lives with her parents and older sister in Bhopal, India. Then one day after a series of arguments with them she decides to relocate to Mumbai and live on her own. Although she hasn't planned anything out, she luckily comes across a real estate agent by the name of ""Vijay"" (Satiiysh Saarathy Sasho) who is clearly enamored with her and does everything he can to make her move there as pleasant as possible. To that extent, recognizing that-other than her youth and beauty-she has no real skills or source of income, he recommends a talent agent of sorts by the name of ""Manorama"" (Sanghmitra Hitaishi) who has some informal connections to those in the fashion and film industry. Sure enough, she gets a couple of jobs in the advertising business either posing for fashion magazines or for a couple of commercials. Yet, even though these meager jobs manage to pay the bills, she still wants more and tries hard to make things work in a couple of television serials. The problem is-she can't act and seems to always mess up her lines. That being said, Mumbai can be a very tough place to live for a beautiful and naïve woman with an attitude and no real vocation. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that I found this to be ta rather bleak picture which seemed to drag on forever in a number of places. And although the acting was satisfactory for the most part, there were too many repetitious scenes which had the effect of leaving me quite bored most of the time. Likewise, I didn't care at all for the ending and for all of these reasons I have rated this film accordingly. Below average."

They probably used the name to grab the attention of the audience who knows about B A Pass. This movie just shows a girl who tries to become an actress. She move out and live alone. And meet with a guy who happens to have connections. Basically a casting couch sort of movie. Which we have seen several times. This has really bad actors, looks so artificial and really poor story line. Just stay away from this. And don't make it about listening to one's parents and all. People should be independent.

The Woman in the Window,,
Chasing Cameron,Hoping this show was produced as a joke,"I am not entirely sure why Netflix took on this show. I almost hope they did this as a joke to show how ridiculous ""MAGCON"" really is. The group is essentially made up of slightly above-average looking children who take advantage of the fact that millions of impressionable pre-teen girls around the world are willing to pay just to be in their presence. The fact that they even take themselves seriously is almost humorous, and whenever the camera cuts to interview each of the boys individually, the things they say are so unintelligent and illogical that it's laughable at times. These boys have no idea how to carry themselves professionally, the one kid Taylor is an ego maniac, and the others are just kind of in the background. They call themselves the ""talent"" but I'm really not entirely sure what talent any of them have other than jumping around on stage while girls scream. I'm not sure how the CEO Bart came into the picture, but he seems like a weirdo who preys on teenage boys' daddy issues. These kids live in a dream world, and this show was essentially just a way to promote themselves even further. Pretty addicting to watch, though, it's interesting to see what these kids view as reality and how preposterous it is."
Chasing Cameron,Looks like a parody; is hellscape reality,"At first I thought this was a parody. Then I thought it was a nightmare. All these young men wanting to be famous without a talent, other than persistence and youth. A few FIND their love of music after their instagram fame. But then I got hooked and it just became sad. One kid had a song that was so similar to another rap song I am waiting for a law suit. Lots of the kids (mostly white) have sad backgrounds with divorce or bullying. Cameron is a smart kid with business smarts. But what are they doing? Do the ever read a book? They never discuss anything deep, but only their own fans and money. Their handlers (except for one Mom) look bewildered. The idiotic girls, who in another generation would simply be Tiger Beat subscribers, become a real security threat. All this to be noticed. Excellent look at the downside of fame. One manager was even texting while driving! That's the idiotic world they live in. I think Cameron will survive with his hustle. Good male model material, which was his original goal. The others I fear will meet a sad fate of many child actors. Weird show but addicting."
Chasing Cameron,Trainwreck television,"I have got to admit it: I found this series absolutely riveting - but for all the wrong reasons. It was like watching a train wreck or a car smash; I wanted to look away, but I couldn't. I was gobsmacked both by these delusional, self-important, spoiled-brats of young men and by the oodles of screaming girls (and some boys) who follow after them. I just couldn't believe people like this exist! These good-looking, sometimes personable, sometimes obnoxious, entitled but extremely untalented (and extremely unaware of it) young men walk around as if what they do online and in life actually has some value or merit. They have the hubris to refer to themselves during this series as 'the talent' (despite having none) and 'influencers'. Heaven help us if these people actually have influence, but I guess they may because it seems there are actually young people who are caught up in all this, attending their idols' appearances, screaming, fainting and acting like they were at a Beatles concert in the 1960's. It's absolutely unbelievable. I hope for their sakes that these young guys made money out of this stage of their lives and that they have invested it wisely, because at some point it will all come crashing down and they'll be forgotten. It has to happen. (Please let it be soon!)

This is a fascinating and scary insight into the cult of celebrity, although I don't think that was the makers' intention. I recommend that every adult and definitely every parent should watch at least a few episodes of this. It's an eyeopener and it's scary."
Chasing Cameron,A prime example of whats wrong with the kids today,"This ""show"" is about a group of kids, who are complete morons. They think they are celebrities because a bunch of really young girls follow them on social media. It mainly focuses on Cameron who will say things such as ""I like hanging out with my best friend because he doesn't look at me like everyone else does, he looks at me like I'm normal""... This 20 year old is constantly playing with his hair and acting like a complete jackass, disrespecting his peers in the process. You can tell he never had a father figure in his life, someone to bring him back down to reality and spank that butt. Its easy to see his Mom let him get away with anything and everything growing up. He acts like he thinks he is a God or something, he has no idea.

They call each other ""the talent"" when speaking about the other members of the group. I watched all the episodes and I am still trying to figure out what their talent is. In reality, they have no talent at all, unless being a complete idiot and being extremely conceded is a talent. I watched all the episodes because I couldn't not watch this train wreck of a show and how messed up these kids are. And I guess that is the brilliance in the show, you can't help but to watch it. But most normal people look at these guys and shake their head in disbelief because of what they are saying. Its kind of like the Anna Nicole Smith or Whitney Houston reality shows, you just cant help but to watch the train wreck. Most people thank God that they are not in their shoes because they really have no idea what is actually important in life. But they hopefully will one day once their 2 minutes of fame is over, and trust me, because they have no talent that time is coming sooner rather than later."
Chasing Cameron,Terrible,"It's just terrible waste of time. If ""Haters back off!"" was funny enough to watch, this is just ZERO. A bunch of kids who got no talent at anything just showing off their abs and Calvin's to screaming girls. It's just this! Huge mistake of Netflix. I googled the subject and was not happy to knew that Shawn Mendes was messing around with that bunch of so-called ""social media influence"". I'm not surprised that there is just one review - it's very hard to describe what happening on the screen in more just one sentence. I've read in some reviews that Cameron Dallas will have a big future in Hollywood - doubt this. What's the most disappointing for me is that there are lots of really talented kids and teens on the social media who are really talented in what they do - like Shawn Mendes, all the sports-persons, amateur singers, musicians, but we got this..."
Chasing Cameron,Nothing burger,"What a disgrace.

They left a black boy behind in another country and didn't do anything about it. Pays to be white in America.

This show should be banned.

Shame on Netflix."
Chasing Cameron,i hate myself for loving this,this show is so good. i couldn't stop watching it. i finished the whole show in one night. i know i am supposed to hate it but i definitely do not and am now having withdrawals without another season to binge. this show has so much drama and gives an inside look at social media influencers life. the magcon boys encountered a lot of problems along the way and overcame a lot in the first season of this show. can't wait to see what season 2 has to offer.
Hache,Takes its sweet time but it is worth it.,"If you are used to American TV shows then by that standard it is a bit slow. The pilot is measured yet entertaining and laids a good foundation. Despite being a predictable story and characters full of cliches, it is never boring. Keeps you interested just enough to click on the next episode button. The most positive aspect about the show is the acting. From minor characters to the three protagonists the acting is superb. Can't say that about 80 percent of Netflix's other international ventures. Give it a shot! It is worth it."
Hache,"""Hache"" - For Adults Only.","From IMDB: ""Inspired by real events, Hache is the story of Helena, a woman catapulted to the heroin trafficking business in the Barcelona of the 60s. Creator: Verónica Fernández. Stars: Adriana Ugarte, Eduardo Noriega, Marc Martínez.""

Two seasons, 16 x 50 minute episodes. No doubt season 3 is upcoming.

Hache (Spanish for the letter ""H"" (Helena), starring the gorgeous Adriana Ugarte rises from humble beginnings to run a night club and Heroin manufacturing business. As so often happens, her closest 'associates' are her biggest enemies and she has to use all her wits to survive.

Amazing to see the Barcelona, fashion and cars from almost sixty years ago. In many ways Hache reminds me of 'Queen of the South', where another strong woman rises from the ashes and becomes a Narco boss in Mexico.

Lot's of smoking, drug use, and gang violence, so no kiddies to watch this. I give Hache and 8/10. Easy to binge watch."
Hache,Somewhat Entertaining,But mostly boring in long stretches. Could have taken 4 one hour episodes to tell the story completely. Lots of filler.
Hache,Loved it!!,"I really didn't know what to expect from this Spanish series but I found it quite compelling. The theme, music, strong woman story and chemistry between actors, everything about the show was done rightly!

Not sure if we get a second season but I wish we'd have!"
Hache,Great beginning - something different,Comentario no disponible
Hache,Love this series,Love this series. We'll made with high fidelity cinematography that represents the epoch pretty well. The music is also very good.
Hache,Simply Stunning,"A tasty cocktail poured over ice cool cubes of 1960s Barcelona night life. An intoxicating blend of gangster grit, sweet suspense, and a rich aftertaste of raw humanity. I'm not sure about the shaken, but it will leave you stirred. ""Another season senor?"" Don't mind if I do."
Hache,phoney characters,"Not a bad series her character is way overblown which ruins a decent story. The detective is one dimensional too. I watched most of the series hoping she would be terminated very irritating character.

Check our Cost Del Sol much higher quality well written and acted series."
Hache,Woderful !!!!!!,"Excellent series I really liked, Adriana was fantastic in Helena's role, Janvier Rey was fantastic in Malpica's role."
Hache,Dull,"Barcelona, 1960. Helena's husband is in jail and she needs money to get him a decent lawyer. She finds work with the gangster Malpica, a heroin importer and distributor. A drug turf war is underway and Malpica is quite ruthless, leaving a trail of dead bodies in his wake. The string of murders has the police interested and they have a team trying to identify the culprit. The police investigations and drug war also put Helena in the firing line. In her new world, Helena is known simply by her initial - Hache.

This TV series had the potential to be quite interesting, and at first glance seemed to be a combination of The Sopranos and Breaking Bad. However, it is soon apparent that this is nowhere near either of those two superb shows.

The plot is not that intriguing and largely seems to go sideways rather than forward. Very drawn out and padded, making for dull viewing.

Character engagement is limited. We should be empathetic towards Helena / Hache but while she's not a dislikeable character she is actually quite bland. There's no other characters worth supporting, except maybe the cop Vinuesa but he's also rather dull.

To top it off, production values are not that great. Colours seem drab, making the dull script even more lifeless. For a 2019 series there's none of the crispness and depth you'd expect from HD. It seemed so bad I thought I was watching it in 480 p resolution! Turned out it was 1,080...

Disappointing."
Hache,You will be hooked,After the second episode - you will be hooked. The first episode wasn't quite a grabber but I felt that it had promise - I wasn't disappointed. The acting is excellent and the drama is above average. The story is just complicated enough to keep you from browsing your computer and expecting to come back and know what is going on. I would have rated the first episode a 6 and rarely give an 8 or better rating but when I start binge watching a show - I don't have to wonder if I am hooked or not. I have to disagree with one of the earlier reviews in that I am finding many of the Netflix international shows better than the American ones - I suspect because Netflix has to be careful about nudity for syndication in the US and that isn't a worry for countries that have moved into the 21st century socially.

Hache,unstable camera,"Tried to watch it, looked good but gave me a headache after a few minutes. I understand the unstable camera method is something new to 'create a realistic effect' but this is over the top"
Hache,Would watch it again!,"1960s Barcelona nightlife, drug trafficing, intoxicating chemistry between actors...what is not to like? Hopefully we get another season soon."
Hache,Not nice,"Very disappointing. Wasn't able to watch even the first chapter completely. It's sad to see that nowadays se hace to ser something like this. Not nice at all, maybe just the music is a little bit entertaining in some scenes."
Hache,Great,Amazing show. The plot is enthralling. Easy to understand. It's different fans unique. The main characters are lowkey toxic
Hache,RHF,"So cute, I wish there was a season 3 I keep watching for Hachi, it's really cool.💕💕💕"
Hache,Camera,"The used camera feels like a cheap budget series, I understand that the director intended to add the oldies effect but it was too much of it, the pics were not clear fuzzuy hazy it's not clear and sometimes annoying.... but in general it's a great series and can't wait to see the 2nd season.

Please take care of this matter next time it feels like a series was shoot in the 1990's and am not talking about the plot."
Hache,Queremos más porfavor,"I love Adriana Ugarte. She is phenomenal. Story isn't like money heist but I am a fan nevertheless. The idea of a woman, surviving in a mans world is appealing."
Hache,Very suspenseful and well written,"This show really holds your interest and it is one now easy to predict what direction it will take. Well written, well acted, and absolutely holds you interest. One note, there is probably more gratuitous sex and nudity than you may expect. But since the show is written by a woman it makes sense especially since the hero is a woman who basically uses her good looks and sex to her advantage. This is basically a ""rags to riches"" story, or what one might call a ""Gangster Cinderella."" The story also includes some famous gangsters of the time period, about 1958-1960. If you are looking for a good show to watch this is it. Well worth your time and not a story you will easily predict."
Hache,Request for English dubbing,"I want to watch this series Please dub this series in English Spanish series are awesome

I humble request to netflix please available this Series in English also."

kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Wow 👏🏾,Comentario no disponible
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Wonderful series,"Kimi ni todoke is one of the best animes I have ever seen. It explores the emotional depth of its characters and also adds sparks of humor to its story lines. Albeit filled with hope, it explores the impact of personal experience on the way we learn to communicate our feelings and our thoughts, and the sadness that can occur when we are unable to do so. Sawako is a beautiful character whose altruistic personality and purity of heart and of thought reminded me why the Japanese people never cease to intrigue me, by the subtlety with which they revive the forgotten spirit of human kindness.

Although to some viewers the sometimes slow rhythm in which the events develop might become tiring, I hope you will have the patience to let the story reveal itself and discover its beauty, the complex mind of the human being portrayed through a brilliant psychological analysis.

This is my first commentary, I sincerely hope it to be useful :) In other words, the exact ""kimi ni todoke"", which means ""reaching you"" :)"
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Pure sunshine (please read the original manga!),"""You brought color to my life""

I've been in love with this story since 2011 and first things first - the original manga is far superior, so please please go read it!!!

But anyway, anime did a great job, it is soooo beautiful, it's a ray of PURE SUNSHINE, literally a roll of happiness and harmony that slowly covers you head to toe, with amazing visuals and voice actors. It sends the most kind and self-reassuring message, all characters are captivating and the music is astounding - I've been listening to its openings and endings for years now. This is a story about real character development, about finding the strength to develop your own voice, to power through, to grasp the life you truly deserve - and never letting go of it. The story about pouring your heart out without expecting anything in return; of outgrowing a love that is detrimental; of distinguishing between what you really want and fleeting emotions; of learning the universal truth that it's all about the timing but if you have just enough luck left - you turn your head and see that your happiness is still waiting right beside you, while you've been looking the other way this whole time.

For those who know nothing about the plot: remember how everyone is scared of Sadako from The Ring? Now imagine Sadako is suddenly sitting in your classroom - silent, long dark hair, paralysing eye gaze, watering some poisonous plants in the school's backyard... But if you pay just enough attention you'll learn that's actually Sawako, whose name no one remembers, who's very shy, always nervous about doing something inconvenient, and has a habit of planting medical herbs. But no one has any idea... no one but the nice guy she helped on the first day - the actual center of attention. It's a universal understanding that they are from two different planets, Sawako knows that better than anyone, so how can they possibly approach each other even though they desperately want to? That's how it all begins.

You will laugh, you will cry, you will sit on the edge every time any character tries to reach another with the words that have been burning in their throat for weeks, you'll be over the moon seeing them finally smile - and you'll love every character, even those that a simple story would deem as ""evil rivals"". Everyone in this story is three dimensional, layered and powerful. Everyone has their own share of heartbreaking moments - and they are all so true to life, so beautiful, so familiar that your own heart skips a beat more and more with each episode. The title of your favourite character will most likely be reassigned several times throughout the series (and maaany times if you read the amazing original manga, for me it has finally settled on Ayane).

And if you ever feel lonely or sad, you can always go back to this story and remember that there is still hope and you can still feel all the emotions you thought were already lost for you.

Thank you, Kimi ni todoke, for always reminding me of how I felt when I was 15. I love you so much.

(P.S. Yanopin forever)"
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,ADORABLE,I loved this show because it had a really healthy relationship in it and it showed a development within the characters.even my sister who does not usually watch romance anime really enjoyed this one!I really recommend it!
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,A beautiful show,"This show has become my favorite shoujo anime! Am I the only one that thinks that this is super underrated? This show is not only a love story but a story about how to become a better version of yourself. The art style is BEAUTIFUL!! I just can't stop admiring how unique looking all the character designs and the backgrounds are. Most people would consider beautiful art style as the number of details or vivid colors or how well animated it is. But Kimi ni Todoke's art style helps you connect with the show's emotions uniquely. The music is also very fitting and beautiful.

The characters are all interesting and three-dimensional. They all develop throughout the show. This show will make you laugh, cry, and scream in frustration. The relationships between all the characters are so cute and will warm your heart.

If you are looking for a heart-warming show that will make you feel all fussy things inside, seriously, look no further!!!"

kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,best romance/slice of life ever,"I watched this first when i was like 10 and I loved it. ever since I've probably watched it at least 5 times, it's become a tradition to rewatch it every spring. I love the art style. I like to describe the feeling you get when watching it as sunshine, it makes me feel so warm and happy...This show has definitely done something to me, I love all the characters so much too and I want to read the manga :)"
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,A series very seldom deviates from the stereotype,"A series very seldom deviates from the stereotype that its genre has created for it, and even fewer distinguish themselves from one another. With Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You, this is the situation. It takes all of the traditional shoujo romance plot elements and clichés and turns them on their head to give us a very satisfying and innovative romance.

The plot of Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You initially drew me in even before I saw the first frame of the movie. Sawako, our protagonist, is a kind and kind young woman with an awkward demeanor who has a striking similarity to Sadako from The Ring. Despite her desperate desire for understanding, her classmates dread and avoid her. All of this changes when she meets Kazehaya, a boy who is the first to really get to know her, and she gradually starts to come out of her shell. The rest of the story follows Sawako as she discovers who she is and feels love and companionship for the first time.

I genuinely think that you had to have already experienced at least a dozen or more of Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You's shoujo contemporaries in order to truly understand how exceptional it is. The usual worn-out clichés are absent. Sawako isn't the innocent, vivacious heroine out to win over a man who treats her badly or ignores her. She is not a harem of bishounen pursuing her in a frantic attempt to pick between them, nor is she seeking retribution. To put it mildly, Kazehaya isn't a dick.

The scenarios and emotions that are shown to us are strong and genuine without being unduly exaggerated. Nobody has a terrible background, a tormenting family life, or any other circumstance that always seems forced to produce drama when it may be better achieved with wonderful characters and compelling narrative. The pace is leisurely, the principles are straightforward, and there are plenty of the obligatory blushes and aw shucks moments. Similar to its tranquil artwork and color scheme, Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You is the kind of show that will make you want to kick back and forget about all of your day's troubles.

This is not to argue that it is without flaws. Although almost every aspect of the show was amazing to watch, the final eight to ten episodes have seen the already slow pace of the show slow down even more. Even though I still thought they were fantastic, I think some viewers will probably grow impatient with the story's lack of development or action. Furthermore, the manga is still in progress, so maybe we are being set up for a continuation at some point, but the conclusion was not very satisfactory.

One of my all-time favorite characters is Sawako herself. It is impossible not to love her since she is so utterly pure and sincere. She develops into so much more than just a socially awkward, shy, and moe girl, even though her character concept isn't all that original at first. From a character development perspective, the person she becomes by the conclusion of the series is so amazingly different from her beginning that it's simply amazing. Everyone can identify to her. But in spite of this significant transformation, she never truly goes beyond her inner self. She has come a long way, as seen by her final monologue at the end of the show.

An uncommon breed for a romance series is the Kazehaya. He is the sole romantic interest, to start. This isn't a novel that wastes time or enrages the heroine with a harem of reverse bishies. He is particularly distinct from other leads in television shows like Clannad or Kanon since he is one of the few who feels and looks like a real person. He is never shown as a parody of young ladies' hopes and desires. He does not come from a well-known family, is extremely wealthy, or is a well-known athlete.

Although Kazehaya and Sawako appear to be very different individuals on the outside, they each have the same perplexing sensations and anxieties about their respective feelings for one another. The two have a very unique and beautiful interaction. Remarkably, I never truly lost patience with them or yelled at the television, ""Oh please, just give her a kiss already!""

The supporting cast of Kimi is also outstanding. Ayane and Chizu, Sawako's new best pals, are the clearest example of this. You would never have imagined that these females would end up being her pals from the beginning of the story. They had almost written ""villainess"" on their features, so it was a welcome surprise to watch these two grow into what may be the greatest shoujo best friends I have ever seen. It is quite remarkable that they are friends given how drastically different they are from one another. Chizu is the athletic, butch type, and Ayane is the lovely, stylish tempter. Their responses to Sawako are similar to how the public will view her.

Even though they come and go, other characters have an equal impact on the plot. Kurumi, the sole genuine adversary, makes brief appearances throughout the narrative and, although she may be considered the series' antagonist, she never comes off as a bad person in my opinion. Surprisingly, Sawako's family life is also very typical; neither her father nor her mother have a terrible home life, and they are both devoted and typical parents-to her as well as to one another.

Kimi is incredibly talented. The artwork and gentle hues nicely complement the story's tenderness and beauty. Every episode is visually appealing and makes you grin, thanks to the clever blending of funny art and stunning surroundings. This is enhanced even further by the outstanding musical score and cast. Mamiko Noto appears to be a natural for this part. Although it's a common character type for her and something we have heard from her frequently, fans will remember this for a very long time. I have no words to describe the OP theme; its animation is amazing and I fell in love with it right away after hearing the first chorus.

All things considered, Kimi ni Todake is in my favorite 5 shows of the past ten years. I found it very engaging in the first episode, and I am really sorry to see it come to an end. Anyone who enjoys the romance genre in the slightest should not miss this; this is how more romantic programs should be made. There aren't many things that compare to this one."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Near perfect love story,"Kimi ni todoke is a marvelous love story with fleshed out characters and near perfect pacing.

Unfortunately, that doesn't go for Sawako's beloved Kazehaya, as he often is an enigma. Mostly he doesn't say much, and when he says something it's rather hollow. First he is upset that Sawako distances herself from him, only to grow so distant himself. He absolutely doesn't act like you would expect from a boy in love. That irritated me a lot, especially towards the end.

Most conflicts are rather contrived, and that's okay as the show doesn't dwell on them and the characters aren't overly unreasonable as they tend to be in anime.

I absolutely love the art style, which changes to doll like animations in comedic scenes, which there are plenty.

Season 2, on the other hand, is absolutely terrible. The characters haven't grown in any way, there are so much forced and silly conflicts, Kazehaya grows dense and is really annoying, and they shouldn't have introduced more despicable characters. Also season 2 has only half as many episodes."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Very Overrated...and boring and irritating,This anime is toooooo slow...story is too slow most of the time it's irritating us....so don't waste your time......I like romances anime like.... Horimiya...Tonikawa...kamisama kiss...Bunnygirl senpai...Tsuki ga kirei...your lie in April...pet girl of sakurasou.... And this anime Kimi no todoke not near to this show....

kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Masterpiece,"This show reached through my laptop screen and touched my heart. The vibe of this show is immaculate the art style and animation are so comforting and soft. I think what was the most beautiful thing about this show was easily how amazingly considerate and kind the characters were. This show makes me want to become a better person, I want to become kind and inclusive like my king Kazehaya, or considerate and helpful to others like my queen Ayane, or patient and calm like Ryu. The characters are constantly worrying about how other people feel and how what they do might be affecting their friends. They are constantly putting other people before them and its so inspiring. I also really like Ryu and Chizuru's relationship, to be honest I really like the childhood friend trope, and lets just say it's something I dream to experience as well. But the way Ryu declares that he wants to change their relationship is so wonderful I have no words to say. I first watched season 1 and 2 and from there I finished the manga. When I watched the first episode of season 3 I immediately started tearing up man, something about seeing this masterclass of a manga get a third seasons was truly too emotional. I believe if everyone in the world watched this show we would have explored our entire solar system, world hunger would have been solved, and everyone would be friends. This show is not only a good show but it's an example you can follow. If you want to change your life for the better, watch this show and then read the manga, you will not regret it."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,i love it,"Gosh ever since i watched it years ago its been on my head rent free, its such a cute and adorable show with your typical popular guy gets with unpopular girl but done wonderfully, theyre such couple goals yall dont know the EXCITEMENT i felt when i saw that it was getting a s3 a DECADE after s2 i was jumping without believing what i had just seen, this anime really deserves it and it definitely deserves a watch from anyone who is interested in the shoujo genre also aside from the main couple i love the side characters so so much.. ayane and chizuru my girliesss they are everything so drop whatever you are doing and go watch it rn."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,"Wholesome, heartwarming, slow, repetitive.","Initially captivating but after a few episodes certain patterns start to get really repetivie and annoying. The show lacks pace, most situations, a few words are spoken but it takes several stares, sighs, screen pans, silence. The story makes a tiny step forward but at a cost of your precious time. Repetitive - lots of scenes do look the same, have the same music, characters act the same way, repeat the same doubts in their heads, then say 2 words. Too much time, tiny steps.

I personally found myself wanting to skip froward more - which is not a good thing. This time could be spent discovering other characters.

There were a few very nice moments that gripped my heart. I liked how certain characters didn't gave up and pushed forward instead of keeping back and having doubts and awkward misunderstandings for 10 episodes. I liked the talk between Chizu and Ryu, that was exceptional for the series.

But it's a drop in the ocean. You have to endure a lot to get to experience those.

That being said, it's not a show for everyone. In general, it's very hearthwarming, though there may be too much sugar for some. Definetely quite far on the sugary end of the scale. It's not exactly cheesy and silly, obnoxious but rather warm, calm, soft, nice.. I love it and hate it at the same time, hence the score.

Visually, it has it's own style, which I don't mind. It's not the strongest point of the series but it doesn't matter that much to me, it's ok. Would be nice if it had less of the sparkly screen pans.

I'd be definetely way more satisfied had it was more compact or filled in. It looks like a thing that could be easily done with editing, one could make the series much better by just cutting out things. But such a decision was made and that's what you get. So be prepared!"
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Oh so sweet first love,"With her long straight black hair and full bangs, Sawako Kuronuma has been likened to the protagonist Sadako of horror film The Ring since elementary school and has developed extremely low self-esteem. Her schoolmates even call her Sadako. In high school, she meets cheerful and popular Shota Kazehaya who treats her with kindness. This boosts her self-esteem and she starts to come out of her shell. Her journey from being an outsider to popular is filled with amusing, though sometimes exasperating, introspective musings of a teenage girl.

This animation depicts first love in all its angsty sweet glory. It can be vexing at times because of how clueless and overthinking Sawako is, but the start of the series is compelling enough to keep me watching. And it was worth it."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Good but prolonging,"The show is actually pretty good, I hate that they made her overly shy. Like can't even get a word out, prolonging everything. Hopefully she gets some confidence next season because omg.

I dont have any more ""characters"" to add so now I will type unnecessary things.

Pizza turkey ham and bacon all the thing of the grass is good and trees are green but where is the in between.why does this need to be so long anyways??? Some things dont take an essay to get to the point ugh, mac and cheese cant wait for thanksgiving . My favorite season is winter btw. The. Cold is great, summer is hot. I prefer yay nvm."

kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,A GOOD ANIME BUT WITH FLAWS,Comentario no disponible
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,Extremely slow and annoying.,"I read many reviews before watching this. At first, I thought the girl would change eventually after few episodes but damn she's slow and annoying till the end. The show shoves down sweetness in such a frustrating manner that at one point I felt like I would get diabetes just by watching it.

I like more mature work like wotaku wherein communication between couples feel natural and not forced. The mc cries her eyes out all the damn time even if she's happy, sad, embarrassed or surprised. There isn't even one episode where she hasn't cried and I can't take It anymore. Female leads should have more attributes to them. They forcefully want to label it as cute and sweet but it actually feels even more dumb than wolf girl and black prince. Both leads could have confessed on 5th episode itself but even communication between characters is slow, this whole thing could have been completed in 15 episodes without leaving a damn thing."
kimi ni todoke -From Me to You-,GREATEST SHOW KNOWN TO MANKIND PLEASE WATCH I BEG,"It is honestly a life changing anime. Great OST, really good character development and a slice of life served alongside a romcom. It honestly may be a slow starter but trust me it gets good and the love in the anime is just pure. It's a really good anime and I recommend you to check out the manga. The pacing is a little slower but it's just a little and if you have enough patience you genuinely experience what the peak of love could be. They have dropped a season 3 recently and it's most likely that it will go on till they finish it and I'm grateful to Karuho Shiina for creating a masterpiece which I consider the best piece of work to ever exist in my opinion so please consider watching because it doesn't get the recognition it deserves."

Miniforce,Bizzare and disturbing but my son loves it,"It feels like an anime written by toddlers, and I would rate this series higher if it didn't have so much inappropriate expression of emotion. The premise is so strange it's almost watchable as an absurd comedy. The main characters are child-like animals similar to sentient stuffed animals, they are a four member defense team with a commanding officer who contacts them in times of need. In their regular day to day they live with a pre-teen human girl who is their caretaker. She has a home which they live in, but doesn't have parents, also is bullied sometimes by other human kids. There is an overlapping metropolis of humans and animals who go about their lives in a strange parallel symmetry. When a villain inevitably shows up the animal team members transform into human power rangers to fight and also have corresponding mech vehicles. They often combine, transform, and do other power ranger things, but the perspective shifts from power ranger battles to anime soap opera drama in domestic settings. Dialog is so terrible and cliche that it is hilarious. The only real irredeemable quality is the emotional immaturity and outbursts of characters could teach your kid to be a brat, a bully, or otherwise disrespectful and annoying. But overall I'll put it on from time to time to entertain my kid, just in moderation. Side note, if you're looking for something to get drunk with friends and watch this will have you laughing in no time."
Miniforce,It funny but there are some problems when it comes to having a crush,"Me and My sister like this show, it is really funny, but the I one thing I hate about this show is the reason for having crushes many characters have crushes on other characters due to their looks, not their personality if you watching this show with a kid, please tell them they shouldn't like people cuz of their looks. Looks don't define a person. These crushes stuff doesn't make sense if the characters fell in love with someone in first sight when they don't even know them, another problem is that the characters like people with good looks not people with good hearts. Later seasons the crushes end."

Miniforce,What the @$*#,The show is terrible! I made an account just to make this review. Makes no sense and it's a huge rip off of Power Rangers. I lose brain cells every time my son watches it. I know it's a kids show but my God it's horrible for a kid show.
Miniforce,Makes Garbage look great,"Think of the worst thing you have ever seen. Then imagine that was unanimously voted by the world as the greatest show ever created. The reason that would have happened is because this show is so bad, it makes everything else look THAT much better.

There is no reason for this show to exist. There's no imagination. It's a bad English dub over, the voices don't match the characters, the stories are just awful. 90% of the villain attacks are poop and toilet related.

Just don't watch it...ever...it's not worth it...it will corrupt and destroy your mind...it's the worst thing on Netflix...which is saying A LOT cause there's some real garbage on there."
Miniforce,Great show,"This show is interesting and funny, even tho im a bit to old to watch this kind of cartoons, I still enjoyed watching it. I don't get why people are hating on this show, it actually teaches you some moral and if you think little kids shouldn't watch this then switch another show then. Like some of the characters has crush on another, its just showing that when normal person see someone with good looking, they will actually like them. Just like that, and this show doesn't contains any thing about love that is more than friends, just cute transformers defending themselves to protect the earth. Idk abt your opinion, I just loved this show."

Ingobernable,"Season 1 Pretty Good, Season 2 Weak!","I really enjoyed season 1 of this show. Sure, there was the usual overacting, but several actors turn in a decent performance. There was a lot of action. Season 2 is Weak!! They must have phoned it in because I was very bored. It is too bad."
Ingobernable,I really liked this; waiting for season 2,"Mexican First Lady Emillia (Kate del Castillo) wants to divorce her husband, the President, Diego (Erik Hayser). During a brutal argument, Diego falls from the balcony, landing on top of a car and dying. Emillia goes on the run when she realizes she is being accused of her husband's murder. She needs to find the killer and exonerate herself. She winds up in the barrio Tepito, where she is not considered very popular.

Very exciting series with some wonderful performances, particularly by del Castillo in the workhorse role. Lots of great suspense and dramatic scenes as the actual story unfolds, far more complicated than Emillia could ever have imagined.

Emillia has two children; her daughter, Maria (Alicia Jaziz) is gay. I have no problem with that at all, but it was completely unnecessary to the plot. Eréndira Ibarra brings an elegance and coldness to the role of Ana Vargas-West. Both she and Erik Hayser were in the series Sense8. There are many striking performances, particularly from Aida Lopez, Alberto Guerra, and Tamara Mazarraza.

Looking forward to season 2."
Ingobernable,A political/police thriller set in Mexico.,Comentario no disponible
Ingobernable,Loved it,"I haven't seen the English subtitles, so i am not sure if the few bad reviews are from people who read a poor translation, or just don't get it....but this show is great! The action, the drama, everything! Disagree with the bad acting comment. This show's characters are well developed and multi-faceted. If you like exciting thrillers, especially if you speak Spanish, you will probably love this. Also... this isn't ""Mexico trying to be the US."" That kind of US exceptionalism perspective is so limited, misguided, and uncultured (sorry)....and appears to be based on a stereotypical viewpoint of how people in Mexico should dress/act. I can say that this show is definitely Mexican, and definitely a fun watch."
Ingobernable,Decent for Latin American Audience,"First: Good on Netflix for working on decent Spanish shows for the Latino/Spanish language Audience. Second: The general quality if fine. It does feel like a Spanish language ""Houes of Cards"" / ""Narcos"" style production. So if you like those, you will probably enjoy this. Third: Ignore the""Overdramatic Cheesy Telenovela"" comments. Those comments are by people expecting things to feel like USA English language productions. Apples and Oranges. If speak Spanish fluently, are Latin American or at least know Latin American culture, and have watched sufficient Latin American TV, it presents appropriately for shows of this genre. I suppose the target audience is for Spanish native Latin Americans, not for those watching through USA English style glasses."
Ingobernable,Sure to please!,"Ingobernable is a superior show. It follows a serial format with short seasons that are popular today. I watched two seasons over the course of a couple weeks, and I loved every minute.

The First Lady of Mexico finds herself in the midst of intrigue that is illustrated by the dichotomy of the corrupt and powerful and those who live in fear and fight to be treated with dignity.

The characters are well written and three dimensional. Each episode is fast paced.

There is something about Spanish language production that have really made me a fan. They commit to the story, and go for it.

Kate del Castillo leads the ensemble cast. She was in the Telemundo production of La Reina del Sur, and again delivers a strong performance.

As First Lady, Emília Urquiza, she wants to fight corruption in Mexico that plagues the life of the innocents.

There are twists and turns, heartache, friendships, loyalty and betrayals.

The production values are stunning. Sets include a presidential palace and desperate neighborhoods.

Even if you need subtitles, it's worth watching. I noted there were complaints about the subtitles. Not every sentence spoken in one language translates well to another language, but the subtitles serve the story well."
Ingobernable,Action packed Mexican political thriller with soap opera overtones,"Mexican culture is separate from American culture and vastly different but in this series they try too hard to be American, in their style, hairdos, morals, absorption of the narco culture via American influence, what I find about all of this is that it is sad, they have semi assimilated into Americans without questioning anything. That's what this series has made transparently obvious when I watched it. The first lady and president appear to be barbie doll perfect, all the upper echelon Mexicans appear perfect, coiffed and lipsticked to the T, that's not how I remember Mexicans. There's flashes of crowds of Mexicans, and there you see the real Mexico in the crowd. There are too many sex scenes, overdone to adnauseum, they're tiring after a while. There are too many flashbacks throughout the series. It's not necessary, it is just filler. The main characters carry on like Americans, violent,overly dramatic emotional, the characters don't behave pragmatically, rather hysterically all the time. At times it is tedious to watch, cause here we go another flashback, who cares, we've already seen this. If you have nothing better to do with your life watch this series."
Ingobernable,Amazing!,"Ignore the bad reviews! This very well written, directed and cast. This was not shot in Mexico, and I impressed in how well the locations were choose. The acting in really good. The plot is decent and crude. Some pleople will say it's exagerated and unrealistic, but in Mexico worst things are happening. Kudos for Kate del castillo and the makers"

Ingobernable,"Promising start, but does not deliver",Comentario no disponible
Ingobernable,"Relevant, entertaining focused on contemporary issues","Honestly the only reason why foreigners may not like Ingobernable it's because they do not know Mexican history and don't understand the relevance of this show. The references to important historical events, the portrait of the military, the media, and the Mexican government, the re-writing of history, foreign government interference, corruption, greed, the interest of few driving a whole nation, it's all just wonderful. Epigmeo Ibarra did an amazing job here and he couldn't have picked a better lead actress. I like how women are portrait in this show too. For me, this show would be a 10, simply for the speech the president did. The speech was, personally, a cathartic moment I am sure 90% of the mexican population would want to see happening in real life. Everything; the president's speech, the well written characters, the portrait of the reality plus the fictional scenarios that are so extreme yet so believable, the good acting, it all makes the show simply amazing."
Ingobernable,"Good action and tension, .. but too much unnecesary, boring and really long sex escenes.","I only saw the first season, I just won't watch the second. The series reminds me a little of 24, but only a little.

Action and moments of tension are the best. That kept me going.

The worst of all are the very long sex scenes combined with very important action scenes, stupid, and also with a terrible background music.

This ended up convincing me not to see the second season. Unfortunately the action did not seem enough to continue watching."
Ingobernable,A soap opera with a better budget,"The story has the usual melodrama and stereotypes of your regular ""telenovela"". As such, it highlights the acute class differences in Mexico in a very Manichaean way (the rich are bad, the poor are good) and uses trite ploys like fortuitous lesbian sex for shock value. There are a lot of inexplicable situations, for example, a fugitive First Lady running away in exaggeratedly high-heels with which she can barely walk or the secret service taking all the time in the world to respond to a presidential emergency. There are just too many holes in the logic of the story to make it believable.

All these traits of the decaying soap opera genre would be enough to question Netflix's new quality standards, however, even the production values are lacking and it clearly wasn't a matter of budget but carelessness. There are night scenes where the daylight coming in from the windows is apparent; the blood looks like ketchup; there are continuity glitches; there is a toy airplane taking off that should have been edited out

In short, I think this show can only be truly appreciated by those who have grown up with - and love - soap operas."

Ingobernable,Watchable & Flows along,It's better than a lot of reviews state. A bit melodramatic at times but then picks itself up. Language dubbing is better than a lot of foreign language shows/movies. Season 1 was easy to watch and haven't seen 2 yet. It won't go into the all time favourites but it's better than the last few series I've seen in Netflix
Ingobernable,Can't stop watching,The thriller is really good and I can't stop watching the first season
Ingobernable,Weapons soup,"More and more a banal and unrealistic story, for each episode, especially in season two. Constantly unrealistic spontaneous actions with weapons, carried out by people without weapons training. Screaming even when it's not critical. Cinematic effects are used as the make-up of a soup of a story."
Ingobernable,Ignore the super low ratings!,"I upped the rating to counter the 1 or 2 star voters. The show is genuinely not bad at all. Yes, it's full of holes but then it's a Mexican production; it doesn't have the big budget and experience of more popular series.

I binge-watched the entire 15 episodes of series 1 and enjoyed it. If I have any real criticism at all, it's that E15 didn't ""end"" / tie up the series. The whole thing left you feeling like it had been cut mid-stream, without an appropriate resolution to the series. That is poor writing/production and, hopefully, S02 won't leave one feeling the same way at the end. It's worth a 6 or 7 out of 10."
Ingobernable,The Shows is a joke!,"Overall the title has good action, drama, corrupt government and all that. But is is a rotten tomato because 5 simple person is beating the system and fighting three different Armies and cartel is not real. Specially a girl (Emillia) she was an X first lady and she is killing right and left everyone who gets in her way. She is defeating the whole Army, Cartel, Government and the show more looks like a Bionic woman. Basically this show is far from being Real, doesn't make sense."

Ingobernable,Escape in High Heels,"Other than trying to run across town in 9"" high heels and constantly making sure her makeup and hair are perfect and her skirt is high enough, I guess the First Lady is reasonably believable as a surgeon. Otherwise this is actually a reasonably decent chase flick. Oops! I mean chase episodic t.v. show not unlike The Fugitive."

Ingobernable,Great fun. Tense. Entertaining.,"Good cast. Good mix of characters. Netflix connected the sweet spot with this one! I read a few reviews on here and mostly agree with them, except one I read (no names) the author clearly has no clue about class differences in Mexico. So a lot of drivel ensued about Mexican culture is very different from American culture, blah blah blah. Give me a break. First of all, the political class in Mexico is more European than American. But also, culture is not homogenous. It's a complex thing. American culture is complex, it's not one size fits all. Not every American is a nascar loving, feverish consumer, bible billy. Our culture is stratified. Mexico is no different; so don't miss out on a great series because some teaspoon opted to demonstrate how shallow. This show is a political thriller and it delivers."
Ingobernable,Too much drama and rotten tomato,"At the very beginning the TV series gets very interesting. But The story have too much twist. Too much back flash between past and present will confuse the audience. The part that doesn't make any sense that how a simple first lady is beating everyone including government, army, cartel and anyone that comes in front of her. 3 or 4 people against the entire Army! The shows is far away from being real. It just looks like a fantasy world where 3 or 4 people that have super power."

Girlfriends,It grew on me,"This is the show that taught me to look at TV shows for what they are: writers' impressions of what life ""somewhere"" for ""someone"" is like. No, this show doesn't portray all of my personal experiences as a Black woman, but it also doesn't portray what I think my life is going to be like as an attorney, either.

If it's funny, then it's funny - and 'Girlfriends' is funny. Just because the stars are Black doesn't mean that it is necessarily there to represent the ""Black"" experience. Nor does it have to. No more double standard for me. I recommend this show to everyone - not just Black women."

Girlfriends,Funny show,"This show is really funny but sadly underrated. The lead actors are good though the changing supporting cast is not fantastic. I'll be very sad if this show gets cancelled because I stay up till late to watch it and its definitely worth it.

The show lasts about 20 minutes minus ad breaks and tackles some real-life issues like children, marriage, career aspirations, therapy. I wouldn't compare it to Sex and the City though that may have been how the concept for the show began.

I await its move from late night television show to prime time sitcom but doubt it will be happening too soon. All four female leads are quite beautiful...contrary to previous comments."
Girlfriends,Awesome,"Great except for the cliffhanger, I want answers. I feel like twenty years is a long time to make viewers wait. Enough is enough. Answers please."
Girlfriends,A RARE GEM IN THE COMEDY GENRE,"I REMEMBER WATCHING GIRLFRIENDS AND FEELING GOOD AFTER EACH EPISODE. WHILE IT WAS A COMEDY, THERE WAS A SOCIAL MESSAGE AS WELL. THIS WAS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT STYLE OF COMEDY BUT IT WAS FUN TO WATCH AND GROW WITH EACH RESPECTIVE CHARACTERS' DEVELOPMENT.

I LAUGHED; I THOUGHT DEEPER ABOUT LIFE AND I SAW BLACK WOMEN HAVING TRUE FRIENDSHIPS AND STRUGGLES. IT WAS A PLEASANTLY UNIQUE AND BOLD STATEMENT COMING FROM THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES: COMEDY. BRAVO!"
Girlfriends,Nostalgic,"I love this series way back in 2000 still wholesome 22 years later. I kinda find Joan controlling, bossy, judgmental, thinking she's better than everyone else, lowkey narcissistic. Everything had to happen at her house or she wouldn't attend or it wasn't as good as it would have been if it was to be at her house. Then turns around and make everyone feel like she's always there for them. She's that bourgeois friend with the money, status, right family and money connections, who's always there to help her friends out but later uses it to gaslight them about how good she always is to them. She's a victim of her very restricted/protected privileged conservative upbringing.

Toni is the insecure girl who tries too hard to breakfree from poverty and the smalltown countrygal image, she ends up materialistic, self-centered, selfabsorbed narcissistic, but in reality all that is just a front for her fears, insecurities&low selfworth. I feel the others ganged up on her most of the time, they're just plain mean to her, made her the ass of jokes, I can see why ""she"" left the show. The show lost it's pepper after Toni keft, Jill-Marie nailed that role, it was never the same after she exited.

Lynn was the typical Aquarius. She's over-educated, whimsical, philosophical, but lots of talent&potential. She's hopelessly incapacitated by her identity crisis. She's the open-minded, sexually liberated and artistic woman, very smart, intelligent, acting lazy, spoilt brat, hoochymomma airhead as a way to fit in, deal with her identity crisis and fit in. She seems to have fear of rejection, using sympathy to sponge on her friends. She is the one whose easy to talk to and you can turn to because she's not judgmental.

Maya, the typical ghetto fabulous teen mom, who married too young, yet grounded with some solid values. She's ambitious and determined to rise above her past mistakes and follow her dreams, nonetheless. She's the levelheaded, wiser one among the four."

Girlfriends,"A Show with comedy, drama, and most of all... love.","Girlfriends is an EXCELLENT show which expresses how some friends can truly help to change your life in a positive way. The main characters are Joan Clayton, a 30-something year old entrepreneur, Maya Wilkes, a sassy author and mother, Lynn Searcy, a free-spirit woman who shares many passions, and Toni Childs, a single mother who has changed her wicked ways for the new baby in her life.

All four of them have different personalities but that is also what makes their bond so strong. This show expresses the love that they all share. The four of them lift each other up when they are down and are always willing to lend a hand in each others lives to make it a little bit better. This show is definitely one that will be remembered, this show shows what the true meaning of friends is!"

Girlfriends,Grows stronger with each season,"This show started out good, and has gotten better and more assured throughout its run. Comparisons to ""Sex and the City"" and ""Living Single"" are fair, but only tell half of the story. As the show has developed, it has made such comparisons necessarily reductive: ""Girlfriends"" combines the best of both of those predecessors and throws in other elements to make a series which is both thought-provoking and one of the most raucously funny projects on TV today. Its location in UPN's Monday night ""ghetto"" is both a blessing and a curse: it gives ""Girlfriends"" a firm foundation within the target African-American audience, but it limits the show's ability to reach out to other audiences. I wish more people would seek it out; I'm pretty sure they'd love it as much as I do. During the third season, scripts have continued to tackle serious subjects with greater and greater success, while keeping the laugh count as high as ever (much higher than 90% of comedies on the air). The performances remain strong as the characters are taken through much more than usual sitcom paces. This show actually has the nerve to tell real stories, rather than growing stale out of fear of change. The producers have managed to keep the viewers laughing while becoming the leading fictional forum for racial issues and simultaneously earning its feminist bona fides (including an A+ rating from NOW)."
Girlfriends,Could watch this series over and over,"I completely connect with each of these characters in different ways. You'll laugh, cry, and get lost in this show. The actors are amazing and have a true and real relationship with each other. Truly a fan! This show has been my therapy since Covid started. Thank you for bringing it back!!"
Girlfriends,Great Show,"I was resistant to the show at first because I was overwhelmed with shows like Moesha, the Parkers, and I didn't like the way they portrayed black people. But This show is different. These women and especially Reggie Hayes show strong successful Black people who worked their way up to their positions. You can see a bit of your self in all the characters, and William is non stop funny as a momma-loving, republican, success oriented lawyer.

There are other characters that you learn to enjoy, but the friendships between these women is stronger than anything thrown at them; including man troubles."
Girlfriends,Excellent Sitcom,"I truly have been enjoying all the characters featured on Girlfriends. Their talent is so deep and rich that I have to remind myself they are actually actors and not real life characters. Having said that I know you will agree with me that it is because of their true talent which is so convincing, compelling and genuine to life that I can almost believe in the reality of the characters as true to life.

I look forward to ""many"" more seasons of ""my"" Girlfriends! Congratulations ""Girlfriends"" for your success of the past and the future with ""CW"".

Girlfriends,"If you like Frasier, you'll probably like Girlfriends","It's unclear who led Girlfriends' formation, whether Kelsey Grammar rounded up a bunch of African-American heavyweights to build a show, or whether the heavyweights leveraged Grammar's success to get their show aired. Either way, Girlfriends operates at the peak of Hollywood production, with a VERY richly talented team of actors, writers, producers, etc.

The result seems much like Frasier, blending stereotype, caricature, and ""comedy of manners"" humor with delicately woven stories of challenges contemporary audiences will see as ""real"" and relevant. That's a tightrope walk. The humor is an established art, in accomplished hands; but the right compromise between humor and realism is far less certain, even for such a skilled group.

Though I might personally prefer to tweak the compromise a bit more toward realism, that would make it a different show. I really like Frasier -- familiar eccentricities/caricatures and all. But I find Martin Lawrence, Tyler Perry, and Eddie Murphy far too silly/campy/ghetto. I did, however, notice that they continue to make more money and garner more fame than certain others. The very-accomplished-but-not-as-famous crew behind Girlfriends surely notices that too.

Creators for HBO & Showtime craft shows to build on the networks' reputation for more weighty/intense/realistic programming. (e.g. Soul Food) Girlfriends' creators must likewise craft the show for the very different market positioning at UPN.

I expect the Girlfriends we see is a very deliberately crafted balance, adjusted to maximize ratings/earnings in a UPN context. The same could be said of Frasier; and I find both shows entertaining.

Male character construction in Girlfriends is an interesting side note. William is given more development & air time than any male on Sex & the City or L-Word, serving as a foil not just in interaction but in his parallel story lines. In making the story about the girlfriends, the writers have wonderfully shown no urge to regurgitate the standard set of negative black male stereotypes. Even more than with Sex & the City, Girlfriends mostly explores the leads' ""issues"" by contrasting with normality in its male actors."
Girlfriends,Fun and entertaining sitcom.,"That is free of race baiting and against victimization speech. So it's possible. The show aired twenty years ago, which is probably the reason for that. I'm only at season one, but I'm enjoying it so far. And if this light tone is kept throughout, I think I'm about to have a good time watching this series. The only real issue I have with it though, is the Lynn character. She's weird, but not in a funny way. Like the actress was on drugs, and it distracts me. Maya is my favorite, obviously. And I love how fearless the humor can get sometimes, especially for a CW series. And even though the show was clearly trying to be Sex and The City meets Friends, with colored women. It has its own appeal and sens of humor, and I like it."
Girlfriends,definitely something for the ladies,"When this show first came out it was considered the Sex and the City for the black folk, and while the premises of the show is smiler (withe the four female friends looking for love career and everything else in between) it's rather different as well.

it's incredibly witty in that Frasier type way and that probably has to do with Kelsy Grammar producing the show, and while they not afraid to talk about sex or in the case of Joan the lack there for every episode is not contaminated with naked torsos all over.

this show does not give the illusion that as a writer for a weekly column you can afford to stay in the heart of Manhatton (i come from South Africa and i know that is expensive) and afford Jimmy Choo's and Blonicks please, these women work hard to look as good as they do, and in Joan's case you might even make yourself broke trying to maintain the look.

This show defiantly found a way to touch on all subjects, broken homes (with out being stereotypical because daddy doesn't always have to beat mommy or be an alcoholic for the home to break up) in the case of Maya and her husband.

you have the Nimphomaniac friend who refuses to stop studding and get a job in the case of Lynn.

the up and coming Legal Aid in the form of Maya

the definite girls girl in the form of Toni Childs so this show def has something for us all....

Defnaitly something for the ladies but Gentlemen you more then welcome to join the fun...."
Girlfriends,A Sophisticated Comedy,"This show is, in my opinion, a very funny well written well acted program. I find it to be sophisticated and not your typical ""urban"" comedy. The chemistry between the four actresses is wonderful and believable. I must admit that there is a familiar feeling to the format of the show but, so what there are many sitcoms that are ""like"" other sitcoms that doesn't necessarily mean they are bad. Girlfriends brings a fresh approach to a old format. I like the fact that all the characters are in different places in their lives and that they are different in their approach to life, I find most of the story lines to be very truthful and realistic. This show is worth your time!"
Girlfriends,great show,"This was a brilliant story about successful African American girlfriends. The writers took us through their valleys and their celebrations. Each character had a different personality. It was well received by professionals. It wouldn't be a show with out one male friend. Big Willie was the voice of reason for these girlfriends. His whit, logic, and a great level of success created balance to the show.

Each girlfriend had her own form of success. But, eventually they all found their true calling/success. They were all happy.

Unfortunately, the show was canceled during the writer's strike. Losing this show was a definitely loss. I wish someone would pick this up or give us a reunion show."
Girlfriends,"True friends are forever, unbreakable and eternal.","You don't find that many shows involving four black beautiful successful women in LA so finding Girlfriends was a gem. This show is an inspiration to strive for your goals, do what makes you happy, don't settle, and friendship is important. I love how even though all the ladies have different personalities they mesh together so well especially when sharing their problems they all come together to find a solution and we even get insight from a male point of view too. Even though the subjects covered are educational, there will be frequent humor. You can accompany the girls as they go through many stages of life, such as Joan's desire to be married, Maya's transition from marriage to divorce, Toni's involvement in a committed relationship and her learning to compromise, and Lynn's development. It's very relatable and will open your eyes to different experiences and the outcome."
Girlfriends,Girlfriends!!!! We need you!!!,"When I tell you I combine this with Martin and Living Single, that alone tells you my collabor of TV. I truly appreciate girlfriends for their timeless topics. I WANT TO SEE THIS UNFOLD. We have enough tv we didn't ask for but this is one that is wanted. The world thanks you in advance and the culture celebrates you."

Archibald's Next Big Thing,I liked it,"It's strange, weird, funny and entertaining for the whole family"
Archibald's Next Big Thing,Unique animated series filled with adventure and kid-friendly humor,"Archibald's Next Big Thing is a unique animation series filled with adventure and kid-friendly humor.

In this season of Archibald's Next Big Thing, Archibald goes on all kinds of wacky adventures with his siblings, Loy, Finly and Sage. Being a chicken and living in an egg shaped house with neighbors of all different species, Archibald finds himself making multiple mistakes and learning valuable lessons through his experiences. From damaging a doctor's office to body switching and even shrinking himself, you never know what situation Archibald will be in. Now matter what, with the help of his friends and family he is able to solve his problems in unusual ways and also with a happy ending.

Tony Hale's, Archibald's Next Big Thing is the next chapter for Archibald Strutter. Producers Eric Fogel and Tony Hale continue to make Archibald a likable character with a great sense of humor. The talented voice-overs of the lead characters Archibald (Tony Hale), Loy (Chelsea Kane), Finly (Jordan Fisher) and Sage (Adam Fally) make the characters believable and bring life to the series. The music, produced by Matthew Janszen, seamlessly transitions the scenes and creates a silly and fun atmosphere. The art director, Sierra Lewis and visual effects directors, Karla Monterrosa and Jessica Oh, are to be commended for designing an animated series adapted from the book and staying true to the original book. The animated drawings and visual effects easily tell the stories of Archibald's never-ending curiosity while being visually engaging.

This cute series makes it okay to be curious and encourages children to learn from their mistakes. Archibald is far from perfect, but the theme of acceptance and compassion guides him through the process of solving his problems. Being a silly chicken turns out to be a lot of fun.

I rate Archibald's Next Big Thing 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 3 to 10. Archibald's Next Big Thing premieres on Peacock February 18, 2021 and can be seen on Netflix as well. Reviewed by Calee N., KIDS FIRST!"

Unless you are a cynic ... actually I am one ... sometimes, so I totally understand if this is too sugarcoated for your taste.

All that aside the rhythm and structure of the movie move along fine - and yes things are way too easy at certain points and the tough love aspect the male mentor is showing our female love interest ... actually his love interest, might feel wrong to some ... but hey we are all different aren't we? So suspend your disbelief if you can and just dance... express yourself any way you can, doesn't have to be professional. Go on ... enjoy."
Into the Beat,"Disappointing at times, but still quite thrilling","Positive:
great main actors
many fresh and varied dance performances
good vibes, but also touching moments


Negative:
often seen film idea without great surprises
overly educational."
Into the Beat,Full of chlichés,"Nothing new in this movie that we have not seen before.

Story is predictable and the dancing is mediocre, especially the ballet scenes make it hard to believe that this girl was supposed to pursue a career as a professional ballet dancer.

What is troubling is the same racist cliché that we have seen before: Black hip hop dancer that is coming from a troubling family background and lives in an orphanage. Come on, why do we always need to put black people in these same roles?

To sum it up: A German version of ""Save the last dance"" that you can easily skip."
Into the Beat,not a bad film,"Great cinematography and good actress, but it felt fake and predictable on some points. A phew scenes were better than the others, I enjoyed the last dance, the metro part and the camera movements. I'm sad because I felt the potential of this film, but lacked a better and more original scenario and a real connection between characters. Congratulation to the team for all the work."
Into the Beat,TL;DR - Wealthy ballet daughter fell in love with a hiphop dancer,Comentario no disponible
Into the Beat,Cliche yes. But just enjoy.,Full of cliches but don't over think it and it's very enjoyable. Katya played by Alexandra Pfiefer is adorable and so enchanting.
Into the Beat,Terrible,First why wouldn't the music match the dancing ? It makes no sense. Second. Are there no talented dancers in Germany ? I've seen better dancers get laughed of the stage on So You Think You Can Dance and America's Got Talent. What a waste of my time.
Into the Beat,It's a fun film...,"This is a cute film that almost feels like a modern day (foreign) version of Save the Last Dance (2001).

If you watch it for what it is, what it gives you - a love and appreciation for dancing you will find that's it's heartfelt. The cinematography is great, and the actors are solid even for them not being well-known. There's passion, ambition, rebellion, attitude, and love all felt throughout the film, and I support all of it.

You will too."
Into the Beat,Boring,"Seriously another movie with ungrateful parents, they think that their children should do whatever they want even if they will be sad for the rest of their lifes , and they don't even care about it, the rest of the movie was boring , she just dance , soo??"
Into the Beat,Predictable... but kinda Loved it :),"Predictable story line and some clique moments here and there... but the chemistry between the two leads was way more believable than most other dance movies I've seen. Overall some really great acting and very skilled dancers.

I think part of the reason I liked the movie so much was because I watched it in Spanish and the translation was fantastic! Way better than the English in my opinion. (I'm bilingual so I pick the best one)"
Into the Beat,Watchable dance film,It's the usual story about a trained dancer wanting to do a less disciplined type of dance but it's done well and the acting and directing is good. Music is okay but is often too loud compared to the dialogue which usually begs the question why. If what is on the screen is so entertaining then why distract with loud music? If film makers want to really make a different dance film then why not flip the story and turn a hip hop dancer into a ballet dancer or is that just too unbelievable?
Into the Beat,Beyond Frustrating...,"I have never seen such a disrespectful female lead. She's selfish, entitled, and rash. Doesn't think things through and lets her emotions get the better of her. Can't get her priorities straight and is painfully indecisive to the verge of hurting important people in her life. She doesn't know how to apologize either. Literally so many setbacks would've been avoided with the right dose of responsibility and communication. She doesn't deserve the people around her."
Into the Beat,Alien,A lot of good dancing in this movie but in my opinion Alien was not that great of a dancer.
Into the Beat,Cool...,"As cute as the others on the subject, here a little more dramatic due to the loss of his mother, and almost his father, he swore that he had died in that initial scene, a delicious soundtrack, very cute, cliché and passionate..."
Into the Beat,Cute film,"It's a cliché, no doubt, but I watch films like this one because of all the dancing, and I liked it. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of a story, full of mystery and excitement, I was expecting exactly what I got and that's enough for me. I also loved it was German, I don't usually watch many German films and this one had nice dance scenes. It's valid entertainment."
Into the Beat,.great dance choreographies,Awesome choreography on the dance scenes but a small let down on the most predictable scenarios. Dance scenes are done great with excellent cinematography.
Into the Beat,Great movie,"Great movie, good message too the world. Follow your dream. Thats the message of this movie."
Into the Beat,Surprise,"Normally I hate movies about dancing.

But this one is good! Great acting, good story, skilled dancers."
Into the Beat,Sweet and light,"The movie is full of cliches and the characters don't speak much.. But I like the movie and I like the way they dance together.. there is an connection between them and that is why I'm rating it 8 The movie is sweet, light and calm."

Marcella,STARTED OUT SO WELL....,"Very disappointed in Season 3. So many scenes with no sense or follow up as to what is going on. Marcella merely wanders around looking and acting the tarty role, and has very little dialogue! Struggling to watch to the end. No need for a 4th Season. Enjoyed Season 1 and 2, but it has gone downhill from there."
Marcella,"Two up, one down","While seasons 1 and 2 were excellent, season 3 misses the target. I was quite disappointed at the premise, including the weak dialogue and unconvincing acting. It seems that season 3 was either rushed to production or the quality control that one had come to expect dropped substantially."
Marcella,Third season is a complete bs.!,"Really third season ruined the show completely, these mental relapses and split personalities is a total bs, unwatchable scenes you just fast forward."
Marcella,Way too serious for such a silly concept,"Enjoyed S1 and found parts of S2 were good. But S3 has been a hard slog. It's just so badly written, I don't understand how it ended up as bad as this. Surely itv have people who check that the story makes sense, that smart characters aren't constantly doing stupid things etc. It feels like they made it because of a tax break in Ireland rather than because it made sense. Please don't make a 4th series. It's run out of steam and ideas."
Marcella,"Maybe I'm getting old, but.....","I really liked this series. I'm reading some of the other reviews, and I think this should get more love.

If I'm reading this correctly, folks think this is pretty standard, along the lines of ""The Fall"" ( I'm going to review that too). My problem is I am not comparing this to other shows that are obviously, and clearly comparable. I realize that this is a good, or even maybe best way to judge a show, but I ain't doing it.

I liked the story, the writing and how the actors managed the lines. I liked the lead, I felt I ""got her"" right away, so any faults she made in character, and her characters behavior got a pass from me. She is a bit much upstairs for law enforcement, but the actor made me want to hope she keeps her job even if she's far from ""stable"".

I felt most of the characters developed well enough. One reviewer mentioned the stone faced guy, I see that too, but the rest felt like actual people who would say and do the stuff they said and did.

I felt it was well done, smartly done, kept me wanting, and in my view, delivered! In comparison to other stuff out there, I won't say it's the best crime series, but I liked it better than ""The Fall"", and I'm just digging in my heels and loving the production more than it's categorical rating. I guess I'm saying it ain't the best brand of candy bar, but it's good ""sweets""."
Marcella,"Great UK police - ""CSI"" TV show!","As you may know (if you are Americans you don't), in UK the police men/women ARE NOT ARMED, they're not allowed to carrying guns. It's tradition and they're keeping that way; that's why killing a cop is HIGH CRIME in UK, because exactly that - they are unarmed. (Of course, there is the ""Armed Police"", with submachine guns)...

...So, this show is a classic INVESTIGATION police movie, with a very good plot/scenario. It's like the ""CSI"" series, but with more field investigation and less lab research.

Very good TV show, I watched the two season in Netflix in ...a weekend! Very highly recommended. We're waiting the new 3rd upcoming season."
Marcella,hanging plots,"Anna Friel is terrific as Marcella in this tv series which began in 2016. And what a concept. She plays a police detective with DID (dissociative identity disorder) whose personal life is somewhat of a mess and has been since the loss of her baby daughter some years earlier. She is now divorced with two children.

I'll just say that there are some great scenes and some interesting storylines throughout Marcella, but there are a couple of big problems. First of all, if one isn't familiar with a group of actors (and I only knew Jamie Bamber) - well, the actors sort of look alike.

Too many beards, too many redheads, too many blondes - I was confused in the way people have been when I'm watching a soap opera and they ask, was that the same woman who was with the tall guy? Casting directors make this mistake all the time as they prefer certain types and keep casting them in the same show. Sloppy. You can do that with a group of stars that people recognize, not with actors no one knows.

The biggest problem is the show's failure to resolve a lot of the subplots. I kept asking a friend who'd seen it what happened with so and so, and all I got was ""keep watching."" Well, I kept watching and guess what - I still don't know what happened with so and so, and in fact, more than a few so and sos.

Case in point - though this has to do more with weak writing. The main character finds out that someone in the police department is filming her at home (which turns out to be a lucky thing). She returns to the office, slaps him, and yells at him for filming her. End of scene. We don't know why he was, we don't know if they had some prior relationship, we don't know if he was obsessed with her - we don't know anything.

However, because of the performance of Anna Friel, I recommend this. Just don't expect answers to everything."
Marcella,One of the best British crime shows,One thing I've learned is to not judge a show based on its reviews here. Stuck to my guns and watched it and binged watched both two seasons in two days . Amazing Defo worth a watch can not wait for season 3. Baffled by the 1/10 and 2/10 reviews it's at least a 7/10 always leaves you wanting more
Marcella,Lead character is so annoying,By season 3 they have managed to make their lead character the most annoying character. Time for her to go.
Marcella,"Great start, but.....","Loved the first episode in the new ITV drama series ""Marcella"" A real gritty start with a couple of story lines to follow including Marcella's personal life with her husband.

If you have read the Sebastian Bergman books by Hans Rosenfeldt / Michael Hjorth and seen ""The Bridge"" then you can see where the ideas are coming from, a typical Scandi Noir feeling to the plot which I just love.

The only thing that spoiled it for me was the ""Wooden"" acting of Andrew Lancell who seems to play the same part in anything he has appeared in. The face does not move, no expression whatsoever. Apart from that a (so far) excellent casting with strong performances from Anna Friel,(just like The Bridge's Saga Norén) Ian Puleston-Davies, Sinead Cusack, Patrick Baladi, Harry Lloyd and Maeve Dermody all playing great parts and strong acting

Looking forward to the next Five episodes in Season 1"
Marcella,Season 3 !!,"What was that?? Wtf is going on, it's like not the same show. It was weird creepy nothing made sense bad at everything. Where is the story."
Marcella,Not Your Average TV Cop/Mystery Series,"I finished watching the two seasons last night and find I cannot stop thinking about it. First, I'll say I think the way the last episode ended was brilliant. Just when you think Well, where can they go from here, Marcella is through, they've come up with a hook to keep us viewers eager to go on to the next season. Obviously from many of the reviews here there are lots of people who won't watch another season, but I'm not one of them. Yes, I agree that especially in the second season there was a lot that could have been better in terms of a cohesive plot. I, too, didn't know what was going on half the time. And then, the resolution of the second season was somewhat strange and unbelievable. Ultimately, though, what I loved about it supersedes what I didn't so I'll say I think the writers and producers succeeded in creating the most scary, depressing, morbid, depraved but in the end, very exciting, atmosphere that I've ever seen in a TV show. I'm not a film expert but I think it was the combination of the protagonist's manic and depressive personality, along with all the hideous things that were happening, along with the created ambiance of darkness, rain, grim isolated settings, along with a group of characters, each of whom was more treacherous than the next, along with the music... all of these created an atmosphere that was almost too sordid to watch. The main character, Marcella, is really so unlikable, but I found her fascinating, too. I thought Anna Friel played the role exceptionally. The irony of her little pixie-face paired with who she is and what she does is delicious. I'm thinking now I may watch the two seasons again to pick up on the many details I've probably missed. I'm so looking forward to seeing how it's going to go forward, given the way season two ended."
Marcella,"Well-done, but with too many holes in the story",Comentario no disponible
Marcella,Disappointing,"We just finished watching S3, not because we though it was so good, but just because my need for closure wanted to know how it ended. And it turned out it was even worse than the previous season."
Marcella,Marcella Season One - Erratic Attempt at Scandi Noir *mild spoilers ahead*,"SUMMARY

A certain murder method resurfaces after ten years of absence, and former investigator turned traumatised housewife Marcella (Anna Friel) decides to dive back in.

STORY COMMENTS

The story comes as a multi-package. There are (perhaps too) many subplots that lead to the ultimate climax, but at the same time don't really help its plausibility. There's simply too much going on, and it all coincides a bit too comfortably.

Marcella is a troubled investigator, whose personal affairs get her into serious trouble during the investigation. The fact that everyone has their flaws is a nice enough notion in this series, and the angle in which at some point the viewer, the main character, and the team of investigators are all uncertain about Marcella's own innocence is nicely done. On the other hand, it's quite disheartening (and a serious flaw) that a top team of investigators fails to assess the mental state of one of their members, which jeopardises the whole operation.

While Marcella appears to have a hard time coping with the loss of one of her children, she doesn't seem too interested in the other two. And for someone who desperately wants her husband back, she has an odd way of expressing it.

There's a satisfying climax halfway through, but at the same time it's such a red herring revelation that it drains the energy somewhat from the rest of the story.

Also, the final answer to the murderer's motives seems a bit far-fetched, crammed into the last episode, and quickly brushed aside.

ACTING

At times solid acting with mostly convincing characters. Though some bigger names top the cast list, they cannot lift an upper-mediocre story into the amazing range. Nicholas Pinnock playing Jason Backland, Marcella's husband, for instance, cannot seem to get past looking stoical most of the time in what seems a subconscious advert for a personal clothing line of tailored suits. Special praise to Ian Puleston-Davies, though. Although only part of a subplot, his portrayal of the disturbed and creepy stalker Peter Cullen really induces some nail-biting suspense.

CINEMATOGRAPHY AND EFFECTS

The lighting and camera angles support the story well. Nothing fancy or novel about it, just solid stuff. There are some redundant shots, that could have been left out for the sake of story progression, but they were probably kept for atmospheric or emotional effect. The tension-inducing sound effects were a little over the top for scenes that on second thought weren't that exciting at all. Other than that, not bad at all.

THEMES

The series seems to want to briefly comment on the aftermath of divorce and loss of children, but doesn't entirely drive the message home. Yes, we can understand it affects the parents deeply when they lose a child, and we all know it can destroy their relationship. Nothing new here. Love, friendship and the betrayal of it, the stubborn solo copper, blackmail, as well as the theme of the hard-line industrial mogul not hesitant to go the extra mile to get a project approved, it's all there. If the broadest of thematic coverage possible is what you're after, here's your show.

FLAWS

To put it mildly, It is quite strange that the main character can just jump in an ongoing investigation at will, after years and years of absence, and without even the slightest reintroduction training. Her trauma-induced relapses don't seem to bother anyone, not even when she blacks out in the presence of a lead investigator, or when she kicks her ex-husband down the stairs after she first wrecked his car. And when Marcella's husband is implicated, the top brass simply agrees she can keep working on the investigation. When Jason pays off his private investigator, he does so in broad daylight, with a terribly clichéed brown, neatly sealed package. Also, that private business investigator's computer is remarkably easy to hack into. And who killed Hassan?

ROUND-UP

To round things up, it is a nice enough story to keep you busy for a few nights, but nothing groundbreaking. Let's see what season two brings. Going by the reviews, we're in for a treat."
Marcella,A young woman detective returns to an old investigation at an opportune time in her troubled life,"Why are the reviews for this show so dubious? It's a well-timed, keep you guessing, edge of your seat thriller from beginning to end, with a perfect soundscape, lots of grip your chair moments, amazing modern photography, an easily followed yet gripping whodunit, a highly watchable lead with a hypnotically baffling personality, exuding with almost 24 hour energy, a mind that is both quick and brilliant and determined, there is up-to-date police method here, used with precision, and the back stories are almost as wicked and engaging as the murder trail itself! At eight episodes long it is not too much to ask of the viewer (each is less than an hour).

I was never a fan of detective shows being more concerned with the private lives of the detectives than the actual police work. Even though that is very much part of the case here what is brilliant about this show is that there are co-incidental tangents between the detective's life and the investigation, somewhat outside of her control, and thus, in this case, we need to see her private life to know what is going on.

To me this show is the correct evolution between British and European crime drama. Sure, I'd still like to see a gritty show that leaves the detectives' lives at home, but in this case all is forgiven. Even the dangerous sounding, and at first odd, sounds of the pumping electronic intro music eventually came to inspire me and see how appropriate it was.

All the actors are great characters, and at no time is belief suspended. It's so good that it becomes apparent to anyone who loved it just how difficult a sequel might be. It's that good."
Marcella,Good game;,"There is no point of watching a series, if it's doesn't keep us on the edge. The humans insanity and struggle between good bad and a strong fight with inner monster is all about this series, it's definitely thrilling"
Marcella,Should have ended with two,"I really enjoyed the first two seasons. They should have stopped there. The third season is terrible, and the last episode is laughable."
Marcella,"Not Bron/Broen, but still a good effort pursuing the mood of Scandi Noir","Being produced, written and directed by Hans Rosenfeldt, a Swedish screenwriter and creator of the series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge (adapted as The Tunnel for UK audiences), Marcella is a good example in bringing related undertones and approaches into the UK context. True, the plot includes some doubtfulness and the characters are not so sophisticated and bright-line as Saga Norén and Martin Rohde, but the series is still thrilling and interesting to follow, one can ponder on and over several events and issues.

The wrongdoer was on my list of suspects, but I did not guess the person too early, that is another additional point from me (I have watched hundreds of crime series and, in some cases, the solution is too plain). The cast is even and realistic, there is no one leading role/character shining over the others, as modern police work is always team-work (sometimes ""forgotten"" by US filmmakers). So, although the series contains hardly any wow! or novel effects, it is still a decent creation to follow, unless you dislike the framework and depiction in Nordic series."
Marcella,Oddly entertaining,"This isn't the type of show I usually watch, but I was just surfing Netflix and saw it. I decided to give it a try, and ended up binge watching it over a weekend.

Marcella is so incredibly flawed, as are everyone around her. There's no clear good and evil, no pat answers, no clean crimes. Everyone is connected, and every connection leads to another answer and another dead end.

There are several very good actors here, including the talented Sinead Cusack as a corporate mogul.

I was very intrigued by where this story is going, and I'm sure it will lead me down an incredible complicated path before it gets there."
Marcella,One of the Best,"Marcella is a show outside the box - I brilliant detective with personal demons that keep the show off balance - I rarely enjoy a show like this but this was a classic and well done. The British really know how to keep you on the edge of your seat when they put their minds to it. Anna Friel is terrific - her skills as an actress have clearly grown over the years - I can only imagine a few gals who could do this part justice and they are all Oscar winners. My only beef is that the show has an episode banner that reads in part Nudity, smoking, violence etc. I have to assume that a Priest is providing the review that specifies nudity - we have more nudity in the States on reruns of Baywatch - Can't wait for the 3rd season on Netflix ."
Marcella,Skip season 3.,"Season 3 was terrible. Very bad. 1 and 2 was pretty good,"
Marcella,Finally a series that is interesting,Comentario no disponible
Marcella,More Agatha Christie than the Killing,"So, yet another shabby detective with a complicated domestic life who brilliantly solves multiple murders on prime-time TV. We've been here before - and to be honest Marcella doesn't quite cut it up against the high quality of the competition.

I'll admit - I've a bit of a soft spot for Friel, and she has the star quality to have carried some slightly ropey scripts in the past, but she can't dominate here - there's just too much going on. Like the city it's set in, this show is frantic, with subplots and red herrings weaving in and out. But as with Agatha Christie or Dick Francis novels that leaves less time to get to know the characters, and attempts to make them ""interesting"" just get lost in the rush. In particular I suggest you watch (series 1) episodes 6-8 in a block because I didn't, and felt I rather lost track at that point.

Marcella isn't terrible, and is a pleasant enough watch if you've already seen most of the big-name modern detective shows, and/or you don't care for your murders to need subtitles. But at the same time it wouldn't be first on my list, and it probably only makes a 7/10 thanks to Friel."
Marcella,Marcella season 3,"This show has the most unlikeable cast of characters I've seen on a series and it begins with Marcella herself. I have no idea why I continue to watch it. I gave this series 8 stars the first season but 2 seasons later that's now down to 4 stars because of an unlikeable cast, other than Rav, and writing that makes no sense. Marcella herself is too disturbed to be trusted with anything."

Better Call Saul,It just keeps getting better and thats unheard of!!,"Someone is responsible for making this such an outstanding show, year after year. The intelligence in dialogue, empathy for characters, twists and expectations are genius. Breaking bad, The X Files are 2 other badges of brilliance. We are privileged to be living in this time as we might have been if living during Shakespeare. This may seem over the top but the scores are on the board, Vince Gilligan. Please correct or remove if I am wrong!"
Better Call Saul,Easily one of the greatest shows of all time,"People who are fans of Breaking Bad should definitely watch this it expands the Albuquerque criminal underworld to unparalleled heights. It's easily one of the most tragic, beautifully written and directed shows of all time and for me at least is at the top of the list of my favourite shows it's tied with Breaking Bad. I'm not really someone who's into the crime genre but this show as well as Breaking Bad are two all time great crime dramas that I actually LOVE. It's a master class of writing and direction. This show is the fastest show I've binged I finished the first 4 seasons in a matter of 3 days. Season 5 isn't out in Canada on Netflix yet."
Better Call Saul,A Miracle In Television,"As of today, it's officially been 9 years since Better Call Saul was released. It's been a little over a year since the finale aired and I'm still mesmerized about how this crew lead by Peter Gould & Vince Gilligan pulled it off, again.

When Breaking Bad reached its finale, it was hard for me to imagine any other show being able to reach it's level, let alone arguably surpass it. And when I heard that there was a spin-off regarding Saul Goodman, I thought maybe the show could have some solid and funny moments, and maybe bring a bit of depth towards some beloved Breaking Bad characters.

Spin-offs in television are usually seen to me as fan service, or a way to make more money off of a franchise that was loved. That doesn't mean that all of them are bad, but most of them don't have the passion or care that'd make you think it was extremely necessary to make a spin-off, especially considering the risk of making previous characters look bad writing wise. And while Better Call Saul was AMC's idea to make more money off of the franchise, I'm shocked with how the creators and writers were able to make another masterpiece.

This show was always meant to be in the shadow of Breaking Bad in my eyes, and I never would've thought of these shows as something that'd be deserving to talk about in the same breath as one another. But Better Call Saul took the ball that Breaking Bad was rolling, picked it up, and launched it forward.

While I think Breaking Bad has peaks that no other show can reach, Better Call Saul was able to do things that it's predecessor never could. The depth and writing of these characters are honestly perfect. So much so that I'd consider the shows leads Jimmy and Kim to be two of the best written characters in television history. And while the cast of this show is extremely stacked, Chuck McGill to me is a character that's honestly overlooked compared to the rest. His character has a pretty clear consensus amongst most people, but there's so much to him and Jimmy's dynamic that's it's honestly not as black and white as most people make it out to be, despite both being objectively wrong in certain aspects of the series. It's really fascinating to me.

The main aspect of the show that baffles me is how perfectly timed the arcs are considering this is a prequel. Every event in the show is written so well and is paced in a brilliant way to the point where no character arc seems to be rushed, yet the show still remains interesting. You think you've reached the pinnacle of a characters journey, then a curveball is thrown that changes everything.

That's not even mentioning how balanced both the lawyer side and the cartel side of the show are. When I first started the show I was eager to get more of the Mike and cartel portion, but the lawyer side of the story honestly paved the way for the first half of this show and was the most compelling part of the first 3 seasons.

My word of advice to anyone who watches this show.

1. Be patient 2. Understand that this is not Breaking Bad.

At some point the show will get very intense, but enjoy what arcs you are given at the time because before you know it, you'll look back and realize you were in the good times of the show. If you watch Better Call Saul after watching Breaking Bad, you might ask for one thing early on. But when you actually get it, you'll realize that the destination wasn't the key, but it was the journey to get there.

Considering most of the characters in this show were never even supposed to exist, it's safe to call Better Call Saul a miracle in television. Whether that was because of an actor wanting to be written off, an actor having a busy filming schedule, or a throw away line that created two of the greatest characters in the entire universe, it's amazing that Breaking Bad was able to pave the way for one of the greatest shows of all time. But what's even more impressive is Better Call Saul makes it to where Breaking Bad is not even complete without its existence.

Kudos to Peter Gould, Vince Gilligan and the entire crew that returned to create Better Call Saul, and I'm grateful I got to experience this universe come to a close."
Better Call Saul,Better watch this,"Had heard nothing but amazing things about 'Better Call Saul' (with nothing bad), with it being one of the most highly regarded shows in recent years. Am a huge fan of 'Breaking Bad', so was really psyched in seeing its prequel 'Better Call Saul' too. My opinion of Bob Odenkirk is also very high, so there was absolutely no way this was going to be missed. Have binged on many shows in the past seven years or so and was determined for this to be one of them, very like 'Breaking Bad'.

'Better Call Saul' was every bit as amazing as reputed. Have seen many shows that started off wonderfully but declined badly in their final seasons, a few with really bad last episodes ('House of Cards', 'Game of Thrones', 'Killing Eve'), but then there are rarities like 'Breaking Bad' where every season was at least positively received and on the most part universally acclaimed. 'Better Call Saul' is another one of the rarities and is the first show seen in a long time to not have a bad episode in it, since 'Breaking Bad'. Seriously compelling and addictive stuff and exceptional in every area.

Visually, 'Better Call Saul' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Better Call Saul' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, although quite talky, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The pull no punches and gritty approach to the subject was often chilling and harrowing to watch. The direction couldn't be better.

Likewise with the acting, with Odenkirk on absolutely towering form throughout as one of television's most fascinating and meatiest leading characters, one that one is repulsed by but also one that is not hard to sympathise with in some situations. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are excellent as well, McKean giving one of his best work in years. The character writing is rich and compellingly real.

Concluding, truly outstanding show. 10/10."
Better Call Saul,Absolutely Amazing!,"Better Call Saul is not only considered one of the best shows of the last few years but it's also considered one of the best shows of all-time! The acting & storytelling are so good that it really does becomes addictive to watch. There's a reason why this show is one of the highest rated shows on this site and why it's always nominated for so many awards and that's because it's freaking amazing! People always want to compare it to Breaking Bad because it's a spin-off but don't. Even though it has the same feel and it's not quite as good as Breaking Bad, it's pretty darn close! I, along with everyone else who watched, was worried how they would end the show and hoping they wouldn't mess it up (like so many other great shows tend to do). Well, they didn't! The ending was fantastic and will go down as one of the better finales to a great show. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad then this is an absolute must watch!"
Better Call Saul,"before the events of ""Breaking Bad"", the legal profession was a gritty field in Albuquerque","""Breaking Bad"" was undeniably one of the greatest shows of the 21st century. If you then hear that one of the characters got a spinoff show, you could be forgiven for doubting the quality. Well, doubt no more. ""Better Call Saul"" is an equally fine piece of work.

The protagonist is lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), who it turns out is actually named Jimmy McGill. He engages in all manner of shady activity, while other characters from the previous show have their own things to deal with. As with the previous show, it's a serial, with episodes ending in cliffhangers. And make no mistake, you'll want to keep watching.

Basically, it's the type of series that you have to see to believe. There have been lawyer shows and crime dramas, but never have they gotten combined so splendidly. It's the perfect mix of comedy, tragedy and thriller. Definitely see it."
Better Call Saul,Saul definitely deserves love too from Breaking Bad fans.,"One thing that stopped me from watching this movie is because I knew this show has nothing to do with Walter White, the man that makes Breaking Bad, Breaking Bad. I believe most people also think the same.

Personally, after rewatching Breaking Bad few times, I have come to the conclusion that there is nobody in the show that I love from the beginning until the last second. What I like the most is the character development for all the important characters.

Then? What does it have to do with Better Call Saul? I believe I love this show as much as Breaking Bad because of the exact reason. I REALLY love how every character behaves and develops in this show. What more fascinating is, this show has everything you like from Breaking Bad. Tension, emotions, atmosphere, character flaws, good antagonists, you name it. One other similarity this show has, this show gets better when it is closer to the end. (I know, it has not ended yet) You really don't want to miss every second of it.

I can assure you, all Breaking Bad fans, your love to this show will be AT LEAST as big as your love to Breaking Bad. Easiest 10/10 after Breaking Bad."
Better Call Saul,extremely underrated,"This show deserves more recognition. Better Call Saul is the most clever show I have ever watched. The acting, cinematography, the story, the writing, it's amazing. Some times even better than Breaking Bad."
Better Call Saul,One of the best shows ever created!,"Better Call Saul has a 8.9 rating for a reason and that's because it's fantastic! It's absolutely one of the best shows ever created! The acting, writing, storytelling, etc are all as good as anything that's ever been on television. This was Emmy nominated for most outstanding drama every season it was on. The cast, led by Bob Odenkirk, are all amazing and all perfectly cast. There's not a weak link on the entire series. This is one of the rare spinoffs that is as good as the original. I'm blown away how they kept this show feeling so fresh and where every season is incredible. If you haven't seen this show yet then do yourself a favor and go watch it as soon as you can. Just warning you now though to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge it as fast as you can!"
Better Call Saul,Absolutely amazing,Comentario no disponible
Better Call Saul,"As darkly comic and multilayered as Breaking Bad, yet very much its own thing","So here it is at last: one of the most highly anticipated new TV-shows of the year, the spin-off from probably THE most highly praised TV-show in the history of Television. Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.

For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at.

Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background ""noise"": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.

The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know.

And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments.

To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show. My (provisional) rating: 9 stars out of 10

Better Call Saul,It's like water pot on low flame....,With every episode it gets heated a bit...... and you won't even realise when the water stars boiling......
Better Call Saul,Kinda OK but at times put me to sleep,"As a huge BB fan and re-watch it at least once a year, I must say BCS is not as good. My biggest complaint is the first three seasons. The juiciest scenes were where the BB characters were involved but unfortunately those were few and far between in early seasons. And honestly, all those matters between Jimmy and his brother, I didn't find all that interesting. The writers would be better off to trim all the fat from seasons 1-3 and make it into one.

But I'll give a credit where it's due. A second half of a show was much better, especially season 5 which most resembles to BB. I did like how the show ended I must say. So, decent but not a great overall but worthy of 7/10."
Better Call Saul,Better Not Fall Asleep,Comentario no disponible
Better Call Saul,Thank god I decided to give this a chance,"Let's face facts: Spin-off TV shows tend to fare poorly to the original content. I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.

Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.

I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?

Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.

I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later. With no hesitation, 10/10."
Better Call Saul,Season 6 couldn't be more late,"Yet another masterpiece delivered by the amazing Vince Gilligan. Everything about this show is almost perfect. The writing, acting, cinematography are just beautiful. Also one of my favourite aspects about this show is the character development, and how well it covers two different parts of it's whole timeline (Jimmy/Saul's life at first and then getting into Gus Fring and the Cartel), something that hasn't been done as well in Breaking Bad. I truly think this show is one of the most underrated around and would definitely recommend watching it"
Better Call Saul,A Slow Burn That Is 100% Worth It,"Many people say that this show is better than the show that started it all, Breaking Bad. And while I don't agree with that, Better Call Saul puts up a really good fight and ultimately has become my second favorite TV show of all time(the first being Breaking Bad). If you go into this show expecting it to be similar to Breaking Bad, you're not going to enjoy it. Even though they are in the same universe, Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are pretty different. There are two stories being told in the show. One story is the story of James M. McGill,(Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad) a man who's struggling with his career as a lawyer. And the other story is the story of Mike Ehrmantraut, a man who gets involved with the world of crime. Similar to the film Inglourious Basterds (2009), the show tells two different stories that collide for the ending. Each story builds up, adding more and more details to the plot until they both get to a point where they collaborate in an incredible and jaw-dropping finale. The show is also masterful at making the viewer understand exactly how each of the characters think and act. It makes you feel like your best friends with each of the characters in the sense that you know everything about them. What makes them angry, what makes them happy, what their interests are, etc. The show also has many easter eggs to Breaking Bad and answers some of the questions that were never answered in the show. The cinematography is also phenomenal. From the variety of bright and beautiful colors, to the camera angles, it's gorgeous to look at. Another great thing in the show is one of the many themes portrayed in it. That theme being that the law isn't perfect. Jimmy and other lawyers are able to use many different loopholes in the justice system to get their way. The final episode especially, shows that even though many people think of the law as sacred, it is anything but perfect. The acting is also great with Bob Odenkirk giving a phenomenal performance. Another story that this show tells is the story of Saul Goodman after the events of Breaking Bad, which are filmed in beautiful black and white. This part of the show is especially entertaining to the Breaking Bad fans. All in all, if you liked Breaking Bad, I would highly recommend this show. In my opinion, it was definitely worth my time. 10/10."
Better Call Saul,An easy 10,I don't remembering rating and reviewing a TV show before but for better call Saul I had to. Its just too good.
Better Call Saul,Everything is great about Better Call Saul,"Exceptional cast just as good as Breaking Bad, writing is superb, soundtrack is so good, cinematography shots are very nice, and entertainment value is bomb! I'm surprised Bob Odenkirk hasn't won any of the Emmy nominations he's been up for. I'm a few seasons in when I started the series I wasn't reviewing then, glad I'm watching the show again I forgot how good it is. I love that the same crew from Breaking Bad is involved!"
Better Call Saul,This show has filled the Breaking Bad gap in my heart.,"I loved every second of the first two episodes of Better Call Saul. We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about ""Better Call Saul"" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come."
Better Call Saul,Definitely One of the best TV Shows Of the Decade!,The 2 seasons are kinda slow but trust me it gets better every episode and i love all of the scenes in Better Call Saul!
Better Call Saul,Let's Call It As It Is... This Show is Slooooow and Even Boring at Some Points,Comentario no disponible
Better Call Saul,Incredibly slow and uneventful,"If you liked Breaking Bad's ""Fly"" episode, then this show is for you. Otherwise there is very little of Breaking Bad here - almost nothing of the story, the pace, the quality or even the Saul Goodman humor.

*Breaking Bad Spoiler warning* Think of this. By episode 1 in Breaking Bad, Walt is already a cook, they're already dealing, have the RV and have killed someone and have another hostage. Walt has cancer, revealed it to the family, met Tuco, the Tuco attack on Jesse, Tuco kidnapping of the two, Hank killing Tuco, and Walt explaining his fugue state to the family and I still skipped a lot of events.

I am currently 11 episodes into BCS and the whole first season could be fit into 2 or 3 episodes. It is short on events and long with takes.

There is a scene where the camera zooms in to show graffiti and it takes about 30 seconds to show ""(I) was here"" when it could've done it in 10. There are a lot of mood setting and establishing shots that are made into scenes. A Cinnabon branch's closing routine is shown in full, including locking up the bottled water/juice, taking out the trash, the walk across the closed mall, etc.

The events are non-events - James playing with a light-switch is not interesting in any way.

The story doesn't seem to be heading in any direction. The episodes end without suspense, cliffhangers or even the slightest curiosity - you simply never feel like you need to watch the next one.

I feel as if all this material could've been great as a side dish for a real story. Instead it's a lot of filler but no real meat.

Breaking Bad was great because it had a great story to tell, great characters, quotes, music, drama and comedy. This one has none of those things. No great dialogues or quotes, forgettable soundtrack, no humor like Breaking Bad (Jesse, Saul, so many jokes), the drama is very little, and the characters, well, other than James and slightly Mike, there isn't much to write home about.

It's simply not an enjoyable show and it does not look like it'll get better."
Better Call Saul,Masterpiece,"""Better Call Saul"" stands out as a masterpiece in television history for its impeccable storytelling, complex characters, and brilliant craftsmanship. Set as a prequel to the renowned series ""Breaking Bad,"" it delves deep into the evolution of the beloved character, Saul Goodman, portrayed by the exceptional Bob Odenkirk. What makes ""Better Call Saul"" extraordinary is its meticulous attention to detail, meticulously weaving together intricate plotlines that captivate audiences from start to finish. The show's character development is unparalleled, allowing viewers to witness the transformation of Jimmy McGill into the morally ambiguous lawyer, Saul Goodman, with depth and nuance. The moral ambiguity of its characters adds layers of complexity, making every decision and action thought-provoking and compelling. The writing is sharp and intelligent, filled with witty dialogue and subtle nods to its predecessor, ""Breaking Bad."" Moreover, the cinematography and direction elevate the storytelling, creating visually stunning scenes that immerse viewers in the gritty world of Albuquerque. From its gripping courtroom drama to its heart-wrenching personal struggles, ""Better Call Saul"" offers a rich and multifaceted narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Its exploration of themes such as morality, ambition, and the pursuit of identity resonates deeply with audiences, provoking introspection and sparking conversations long after the credits roll. In essence, ""Better Call Saul"" is not just a television show; it's a work of art that sets the standard for excellence in storytelling and cements its place as one of the greatest shows of all time."

The Heirs,Scattered Script,Comentario no disponible
The Heirs,Beautiful,"Very good drama, depicted in the context of medieval Spain/Catalonia, reflecting its Moorish and Jewish legacy and the beginnings of the Inquisition. Won't win an Oscar but highly enjoyable drama. Btw, it's a sequel to the prior series La Catedral Del Mar, so if you're into this kind of genre I'd watch that one first. Both are very good yet different."
The Heirs,Very entertaining!,"This is a great historical story. I binge-watched in 2 days. I am a sucker for good period series and this was a good one.

The story races along over the eight episodes and there are lots of twists and turns, with some of them being quite unexpected.

The acting is good from the ensemble cast. The scenery and sets are superb, as is the music, and it's very well shot. One slight quibble would be a couple of the sword-fighting scenes could have been handled a bit better, but that's a minor quibble in what is a really good series.

And, as I always say, watch the native language version with the subtitles. Why anyone watches things dubbed into a different language completely mystifies me. They're never as good.

Recommended!"
The Heirs,Surprisingly Good,As a fan of period piece this show was very lowkey and I stumbled upon it. It's really engaging and the plot unravels perfectly with good pace. The characters are well fleshed out.
The Heirs,Dumbest set of characters assembled for a show,"The only stars are for the production value (location, cinematography, score, location) that takes a very flawed script and story and displays it with a straight face.

If the intent was to depict the suffering caused by religion in the medieval period, making every man cruel or a total dumbass with no principles or morality and woman jump in to have sex with them regardless of marital status isn't the way to do it. The only intent seems to be to create sufferance-porn in the way one might do a sadistic prison movie where misfortune and suffering is the point.

The story seems to jump between some episodes only captured in the intro as if some episodes were cut out.

The protagonist has all the emotions of a slug but always jumping to do the wrong thing so as to provoke more misfortunes or suffering which I guess is the point. Never seems to learn a thing.

Keeps switching between irritating and boring and finally one doesn't like any character."
The Heirs,Couldn't stop watching it!,"This was well worth the watch, especially if you wanted to learn something about the lives of the common people (Christians, jews, muslims, women and slaves) in a medieval kingdom which is in today's modern Spain. The acting was excellent and I believe that the storyline reflected the harshness of the Church and aristocracy of the time. The commentator who said it was boring was obviously not watching the same series as I was."
The Heirs,Unbreakable Bond,"Engaging story of love, passion, betrayal, family values, and triumph amid adversity at an important segment of Spanish history. The story of Hugo Llor brings us to mid-14th century to early 15th century at a time of pogroms, corsairs, regnal successions when the influence of nobles on the royal court was considerable and when Jews were better off than other residents of Barcelona causing resentment among them.

It's mainly the story of Hugo Llor and Bernat Estanyol, the heir of Arnau Estanyol, who is the chief character in ""Cathedral of the Sea,"" the prequel of this series by the same author, Ildefonso Falcones.

The avid student of European history will appreciate this story set against a nascent Spain when it's starting to flex its colonial muscle. He will be introduced to Spanish kings of those times like Peter of Castile and Alfonso.

This historical backdrop heightens the human drama as the viewer keenly watches the main characters tell their stories as they are caught up in events of that period.

The main actors are convincing especially Yon Gonzales and David Solans as the adult and the young Hugo Llor, Rodolfo Sancho as the adult Bernat Estanyol, Mercedes Leon as Barsha and Aria Belmar as Merce.

As this is a period film, the film ensures that the costumes and the settings are authentic. Quite picturesque are views of the vineyards under a bright sun.

Beside being a historical film, this one drives home important life lessons. Watch it. It's binge-worthy."
The Heirs,Perfect,"I enjoyed very much watching this Netflix series. The characters were great and the directing too. So realistic, It was like I was living at that period of Spain's past.

Haven't read the novel and I can't understand these few 1/10 reviews."
The Heirs,Pathetic characters,"Four episodes in and it's really difficult not to be frustrated by the characters especially the main one. Coward and indecisive.

Bit painful to watch.

Costumes are excellent though."
The Heirs,Amazing,"As a woman who was born in Spain 🇪🇸 these are the stories I've heard from family. This was an amazing TV series. Some people on here have said it was boring. I say it was raw and beautifully written. Yon González Luna is an amazing actor. He made you feel is pain. I would love to see him in American films. Please watch this series and make your own decision, I truly believe the series will not disappoint you. If I could read this 1000 stars I would. I was truly moved."
The Heirs,A lesson in impulsive thinking!!,Comentario no disponible
The Heirs,Amazing,"It's about the history we've lived centuries ago, and it has touched me as a woman. Amazing actors, deep emotions, and the feeling of being a victim of unfairness left me so emotional. I am grateful to all the staff who has worked on this awesome series."
The Heirs,Disappointing same as his books,Where to begin. I guess the fault lies with the writer of the books . He creates these characters so hateable and pathetic. It was the same in his previous book/series cathedral of the sea. It's all doom and gloom and in the last episode the hero wins . It's all religions suffering pathetic and weak. Don't watch this . Only Spanish people will vote this rubbish.
The Heirs,Amazing series!,"I learned a lot about Christianity thanks to this series.

Amazing story with; awesome acting and directing.

I recommended this to everyone who loves history, drama, and learning about religions."
The Heirs,Better than I expected,"What a wonderful series. The costumes, the sceneries, the actors, the educational story, all of it was simply great done and to experience. It brought me back and I could completely disconnect and enjoy each episode. See it and you won't regret. Congrats to the director and all the staff.

Hope to see more of this genre. It merits 9/10."
The Heirs,Confused by series,"THIS appears to be a continuation of CATHEDRAL BY YHE SEA (2017). Given the timeline each series covers I suspect there's a series I'm unaware of? I can't find anything online or on Netflix to confirm or deny a missing a series.

Heirs to Land is really good. Seemed to drag in places towards the end but overall...definitely worth a watch."
The Heirs,Where are the Moors?,"Continuous drama keeps the viewer's attention in this historical movie. I enjoyed watching an episode and then googling for a fuller understanding. However it wasn't until the 6th episode the word Moor mentioned. And the reference was to Hugo's slave housekeeper. The Moors occupied and controlled southern Spain for 800 years. Why was this woman a slave if the Moors were the conquerors? In fact, I counted only one person with dark skin in the entire series. The Moors brought culture and science to Europe and Spain was the epicenter. Just like in the USA, people of color are seldom historically appreciated."

The Heirs,Story of a grown-ass wuss and an idiot.,"3 episodes in its painful to watch. The main antagonist is a cripple and the protagonist is such an idiot and a wuss who fks up everyone's life around him, even you'll feel bullying him."
The Heirs,"Engrossing, almost epic","This is a sequel to Cathedral of the Sea, though it's entertaining on its own, even if you haven't watched the prequel.

In 14th century Spain, 12-year-old Hugo Llor (David Solans, Yon González), his mother Antonina (Marta Belaustegui) and sister Arsenda (Bruna Cusí) have to go their separate ways to find work after his father's death. Hugo becomes an apprentice at a ship-building company owned by Arnau Estanyol (Aitor Luna), the male lead in Cathedral of the Sea, and now a well-to-do and respected elder in the community.

At the same time, Arnau's son Bernat (Arturo Sancho, Rodolfo Sancho) goes out to sea to learn navigational skills.

Not long after, the king dies, ushering in a change in power dynamics that upends Hugo's life. Events happen that end up with Hugo living with Arnau's friend Jucef Crescas (Nancho Novo) and his community of Jews, helping them attend to their vineyard. He falls in love with Jucef's daughter Dolca (Gabriela Andrada) who becomes his lover.

A change in political situation again upends Hugo's life. This becomes a recurring theme in this series, showing how power struggles in the upper echelons of society affect common folks. Religious persecution, particularly of Jews, is also depicted.

Amidst these social and political changes, Hugo soldiers on. He reconnects with Arsenda and Bernat in much different circumstances, the entanglement of their stories fantastically woven."

The Heirs,S1E1,"So far, so cheesy. Just can't with this right now. Trying something else; maybe it's just my current mood. Castlevania it is, since I have to arbitrarily add words to meet a quota?!?"
The Heirs,It's pretty bad except the fact that it's also pretty good,"That's the first thing I thought when I started watching it. It's pretty good for upholding the era of Christianity and Inquisition. The plot seems scattered and I feel sometimes that I'm watching a soap opera. The show has potential but I think too much love drama is ruining it for me. Some scenes remind corn and they're unnecessary to the plot.

Honest opinion? It's better than some of the shows on Netflix."
The Heirs,Very boring and disappointing!,When I saw the title and name of the main characters I expected to see a great movie but after watching the first five minutes or so my mood drastically changed. Spanish is my first language and I was able to catch any and all language secret messages the actors were trying to convey. What a big disappointment. This movie turned out to be a big zero to the left. Don't waste your time with this movie.
The Heirs,Mixed opinions,"This had some great footage, and some interesting content, that being said, the story lacked polish. At least the English version. Maybe better in Spanish. The writing is a bit illogical and scatterbrained. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is the obvious work that went into this piece, however I do find it sad that so much effort was expended on a half hearted plot."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Definitely makes more sense as a show.,"This show is pretty decent. I mean a plot of aliens taking over Earth as a movie ended too early on considering that it lasted a while. But the show is pretty neat. My favorite episode is the last one from Season 3. To me, at least, this show would fit in 20 minute episodes for epic plots and stuff, but 11 works better. Be warned for gross out jokes though, which kept it from being a 7. The plots can be a bit random most of the time, but some can be coherent enough to be nice."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,It's pretty okay I guess,"I used to watch this show as a child when it first came out. I started rewatching it recently. It's ok. It's pretty random, but it's also kinda funny in some parts. I mean... obviously it's a Dreamworks show so... yeah kind of a lot of gross-out jokes. But when the show isn't being random and a lil gross, it's pretty entertaining! Not amazing at all. Pretty good tho. It does a good job leaving us where the movie ended. I'm only on the first season, but so far I think it's okay. I miss Jim Parsons tho... The new voice actor for Oh is good... but doesn't rly hit the same. Sooo... this show is a fair 7."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Better than the movie,"The movie is alright but they were almost killed because of an email. That was pretty silly. I feel like the permise works better as a show. Its a little bit like fairly odd parents because the gadgets are like wishes. Tip is rambunctious and up beat, Oh is weird and doesn't quite understant earth culture, and the mom is laid back. Its really wacky and alot of fun."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Tried too hard to be funny,"Got very excited when I saw this on Netflix... until I pressed play. Everything was just too over the top for me and the ""funny moments"" just felt too forced and the plots were all over the place. Although anyone who likes Adventure Time will probably love this as it's basically just that show with Home characters."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,One of My Favorites,"I love the movie but I have to say that the series is even better. The animation is amazing and can make me laugh without any need for dialogue. That being said, my son and I quote the show to each other daily. I love that the Boov speak improper english but no one corrects them. I love that the Boov have 7 genders. I love Tip & Oh's friendship and how they have disagreements and arguments but heal in a healthy way and grow. I just freaking love this show and am so glad there are multiple seasons. I can never have enough! Thankings you!"
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Love watching this amazing show with my daughter,"Thoughtful - Amazing, original and absolutely wonderful!"
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Hilarious and Inclusive,"This is a great show, it's funny and light hearted, but you'd have to watch more than the beginning of one episode to know that."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Reminds me of Adventure Time,"When it comes to DreamWorks Animation, there are any types of animation, theatrical animated movies and cartoons. The 2015 film, Home was pretty fine, yes, the movie was juvenile but at least it has a good moral, creative visuals and great animation. It's cartoon, Home: Adventures With Tip & Oh however, did some pretty decent job. It has some creative visuals and interesting stories in every episode of this show and plus, it has some pretty lesson learning morals for all audiences. The visuals of this reminds me a lot like the style of Adventure Time and it does has the similar tone from Adventure Time when it comes to fun adventures and great friendship. I would easily say that this show is pleasant and I give this one an 8.7/10"
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,funny and clever without taking itself serously,One of the few shows my daughter digs that I can enjoy honestly. Dont get all the negative reviews.../shrug
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Awesome Show,"I am 34 and my daughter is 16 years old and we both loveeeee this show! This is one of the only animations I will sit down and actually watch all the way through. Sharzod is one of my fave characters, she is Hilarious the way her and tip go back and forth. We always wanted to meet the writers for the this show to give them a high five! lmbo."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,good show,Love it! wow. this show is funny and perfect for kids.
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Great show,"The movie was good, but the show is great. Too bad it's over. I really enjoyed it."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Hilarious,One of few cartoons I enjoy watching with my child that doesn't annoy me. Sharzod is my favorite.
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Cute!,"Sad to see that it has low reviews. The boov are absolutely hilarious, and it's a heartwarming little show. So yea, I really love it. :)"
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,The Best!,Love this show. It's a jewel. Beautiful journey revealing the meaningful moments weaving an instance in the lives we live. Timeless joyful echoes
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,One of my faves,"I love this show. I had to wait until adulthood to get a cartoon with a relatable, black girl protagonist. Tip is an interesting character who is a bit of a tomboy, isn't a perfect Mary Sue, and isn't a boring stereotype.

The show itself is a fun watch for adults and children. My daughter and I have watched every episode and look forward to season 5. One of my favorite cartoons"
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,Crazy hilarious,"I've been watching this show with my 9 year old son for a few years now. It's an interesting perspective to a teenage girl's life and on how difficult it might be for an alien (foreigner) in a new environment. The show is intelligent, crazy, funny and one of the few shows I can repeat watching and still consider it entertaining."
Home: Adventures with Tip & Oh,It's one of my faves,I absolutely adore this show. In my opinion it's better than the movie. It's very inclusive and the main and even side characters are very well written.

Zig and Sharko,Golden era slapstick,"Borrowing heavily from the classic Looney Tunes and MGM animation tropes, this series will elicit nostalgia for a bygone era of animation. This series is the classic scenario of might over cunning, although neither Zig nor Sharkolo are particularly ingenious. Lots of prats and big booms, and violence invariably causes and solves all the problems on this show. The helpless mermaid adds even more tropism as the damsel in infinite distresses. On the rarer occasion where Zig and Sharkolo have to work together, it reminds me of those episodes of Tom and Jerry where the two would set aside their obvious differences to solve a shared dilemma, only to be back at each other's throats as soon as it's resolved. The art direction relies a little too much on Ren and Stimpy and Spongebob Squarepants, but even still, it manages to stand on its own. Non-verbal, so translation won't be a problem to any global audiences."
Zig and Sharko,Too Funny!!,"This cartoon makes me laugh so hard! So far, this is one of the best Xilam productions, in my opinion. I was amazed to discover it's a French cartoon. I'm not too fond of French productions, but ""Zig & Sharko"" is an exception. I can easily ""get"" this type of humor (slapstick), even if I'm used to American and British comedies. The inventiveness of the team working on this cartoon is so impressive: they always come up with incredible ideas. In addition, I really like this type of animation, it's more similar to what I was used to in my childhood (e.g. Wile E. Coyote). I love the visuals, the sound effects, the narration and directing style.

Two seasons of ""Zig & Sharko"" have been released, each season consisting of 26 episodes. Due to the nature of the stories, I would recommend it to kids ages 7+."
Zig and Sharko,Solid Cartoon,Comentario no disponible
Zig and Sharko,Not bad at all,"This is one of those baby shows that is free on YouTube with episodes posted every week that you have probably never seen air on actual TV. You would expect it to be bad based off of that, but it's actually a really good baby show. The visual style is... okay. It does what it needs to. It is probably the best animation you can get out of a show with this level of obscurity and disposability. Xilam, the studio responsible for it, seems to specialize in taking shows with passionate creators that aren't quite working with the big names yet and giving them a good and just treatment.

This show is about a mermaid, her shark boyfriend, and an animal that attempts to eat her. It is reminiscent of slapstick comedy like The Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry. Humor wise, it is surprisingly funny. Sometimes it can get a good laugh out of you and have unexpected (and somewhat offbeat) turns. It has a handful of creative bones in it, and you can tell at least a few of the people making it cared about it at least little bit. There is a sharp increase in general show quality in season 2, and season 2 and 3 are the best of the show.

It is very hyperactive and attention grabby, though. The constant, FOP style of music use and sound effects can be a turn off for some. Also, I'm not sure what was trying to be achieved with the theme song.

It is a show for very small children, but it has a certain simplistic charm, and I ended up admittedly liking it after watching. Compared to the sludge that's on YouTube nowadays, it is one of the best things your kid could mindlessly click on."
Zig and Sharko,Silly entertainment,"This cartoon is presumably a remake of 'Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner'. Instead of a hungry wolf, however, we got a starving hyena whereas an ostrich is replaced with a mermaid.

The series so far consists of two seasons with seventy eight episodes each. The plot almost solely circles around Zig - a desperate hyena on a remote island who tries to catch and eat Marina - a redhead goofy mermaid. Most of the plans to catch the mermaid are neglected by Sharko - a great white shark (duh!) who is Marina's very protective boyfriend. Zig is also accompanied by a hermit crab named Bernie. Occasionally, a few other characters are introduced but most of them just once.

The cartoon is very colorful, nonetheless, the first season has different character and background graphic design than the second one. This may be probably explained by the fact that the first season ran during 2010 whereas the second was broadcast during 2016. Noticeably, some of the character changes are present as well. Personally, I prefer the first season.

There are several music themes present in both seasons and interestingly, there is no spoken dialogue. All characters communicate with each other by gestures and other ways of non-verbal communication.

As explained the cartoon bears considerable amount of similarities to the Road Runner show. Zig is very creative in methods concerning capturing Marina just like Wile E Coyote was. Very often he uses various sea animals to obtain his goal which is hilarious. Of course typically he is either out of luck or mostly his attempts are hampered by Sharko - needless to say in a quite horrific manner but as an adult I am not much bothered by this. The show was meant to be quite silly and as an entertainment it is pretty good."
Zig and Sharko,Off beat and Imaginative,A refreshing break from the writing formulas mainstream kids cartoons and no repetitive dialogue. Has a Pepe le Pew meets Animaniacs feel to it.
Zig and Sharko,ANNOYING,"Animation is okay,characters are flat and voice acting and story are annoying as hell"
Zig and Sharko,Only watch season 2 and 3 - 10/10,"I watch zig and sharko with my kids and it gives me the classic cartoon laughs, season 2 and 3 are amazing and funny and im waiting for season 4."
Zig and Sharko,Do not let your child watch this,Why would anyone let their kids watch this crap? It's cheap humor without the benefits of any sort of duologue. Just random sound effects that will leave you annoyed and your kids development stunted.
Zig and Sharko,Great,"In my personal opinion it is very good for someone who is younger, give them a sense of entertainment that doesn't have to be educational 24/7 and instead more on the funny side. It can let your kid learn how to pick sides and even parts of the show give a few lessons on what is good to do in life for other people and how to get along, I personally watched this when I was a bit younger so I'm speaking from experience when it comes to this specific show. And for the sexist comment, just how is this sexist on its own? They probably call the original Donkey Kong sexist for the person you have to save being a girl."
Zig and Sharko,Sexist,"I dislike this show because it portrays women and girls as helpless beings, who always need to be rescued by men when in trouble. I don't want my daughter to watch this show."
Zig and Sharko,Aggressively Bad,"""Zig and Sharko"" comes out swinging with an intro sequence that rips the earbuds out of all five senses, and absolutely never lets up. Each episode contains three 7min sequences, so you get to hear that high school ska band a theme song over and over. The plots are asinine ordeals driven by violence and sexism. It's surprisingly more annoying to listen to than Ryan's Mystery Play Date and TroTro combined, and it has no redeeming value for children whatsoever. I wish Netflix would drop the show so my kids would stop finding it."
Zig and Sharko,Too loaud and cringe.,Do not watch this. It's full of shouting and has absolutely no sense.
Zig and Sharko,Stupid,This is more like some of the stupid and ugliest cartoon I've ever seen. And this is now gived up. This is more like so ridiculous. And so Ewww! Everyone hates it!

Loving Adults,Loving Adults,"This Danish crime drama is told in flashback as a policeman talks to his daughter about a case he was unable to solve but is convinced he knows what happened. A woman is knocked down and killed by a hit and run driver. We then see, a few days earlier, married couple Christian and Leonora having an argument; he doesn't want her to see a text message he received in the middle of the night... understandable given that it is from his lover. When she finds out he is ordered out of the house and told that she intends to report a financial crime he committed some time before. He determines to kill her.

I really enjoyed this film. It provides plenty of twists and turns and for much of the time I was unsure whether we are being shown what actually happened or merely the policeman's theory; this added to the intrigue for me. Right up until the end credits began I had no real idea how it would end. There is a good sense of danger and some, but not an excessive, amount of violence. The cast is impressive; most obviously Dar Salim and Sonja Richter as Christian and Leonora respectively. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of psychological dramas.

These comments are based on watching the film in Danish with English subtitles."

Loving Adults,Interesting and unexpected plot twists with unlikable characters,"As others have said, good plot with unexpected twists. Middle aged businessman with a baggage of some financial cheating falls for his young associate who demands that he chooses between her and his family. Pretty standard set-up, but what follows is far from what you expect. Murders, blackmail and dark secrets from the past . The script sometimes feels strectched, but hey, its a movie!, keeps it it interesting, makes you wonder hwat happens next!!

I think the surprise ending would be fine as it is IF the characters (or at least one of them) were a bit more likable.

Regardless, a worthwhile film to watch, keeps you guessing to the end!"
Loving Adults,Nice Danish Crime Thriller,"Loving Adults based on a novel, is a crime cliffhanger with unpredictable and fascinating story about love, jealousy and sacrifice. Its all about suspense and dark twists in order to keep a failed marriage intact.

I won't say much more, other that it is worth a watch. The leading actress is amazing, she really is the start of the movie.

The production values are good. The cinematography is cold and beautiful as you can expect from the Scandinavian industry.

In general, Loving Adults is quite an entertaining thriller with enough twists and turns to keep the viewers in their seats. The ending feels a bit weak in comparison with the climax

Of course it has its flaws but overall is worth a watch!"

Loving Adults,Underrated.,"This is a crime drama movie based on a book of the same Danish name (English: Till Death Do Us Apart, I think)

Very short runtime @ 1hr44m, watch this if you're in the mood for something different. I can name a similar 2014 crime/mystery thriller that you'd have watched, but if I name it to convince you to watch it, it might give the plot away.

The story revolves around a couple who, seemingly, have the perfect life until trust, morals, fidelity, etc. Are questioned. While it's not mindblowing, it's surely worth a one-time watch and there will be a couple diversions that you may not see coming.

Great cinematography (oooo, this movie looks amazing!) and sound design add to the value. Scores are underrating the film, so ignore them, and give it a shot."
Loving Adults,"a nicely made danish movie, with some good twists","For this being the first danish netflix original, I have to say it was pretty good. Interesting twists and turns mixed with a good cast. As the way that netflix movies have been going, as well as some of the shows not all of them have been that great recently. But I feel this film is a step in the right direction. It may take a while to start and be a little boring before it gets started. But once it does its a good watch with some suspenseful moments and some that even could leave your jaw a little open. Overall a pretty decent netflix original and I look forword to seeing more like this in the future."
Loving Adults,Excellent,"A middle-age man has to choose between his wife and his mistress and he gets in to way more trouble than just that, along the way.

This is an awesome Danish thriller (dubbed believably in English) with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. You think you know which direction the film is headed in, but trust me, you absolutely don't. Watch it if you like Hitchcock-type thrillers. The leads are great and the ending was perfect and unexpected in my opinion.

I hope Netflix can give us more of these types of films in the future as I thoroughly enjoyed this one and found it to be fast-paced and fun."

Loving Adults,Gotta Hand It to The Scandinavians,"I've loved every single Scandinavian film I've ever watched and this one from Denmark is no exception.

It has a suspenseful build up, a shock midway through and lots of twists and turns to keep the audience interested.

The psychology element is not missing so this movie definitely falls into the category of Psychological Thriller, my favorite genre.

Was pleased also to see that Netflix finally decided to depart from its heavy boatload of men's action thrillers and cartoons. There's so much good stuff out there and Netflix always manages to miss out on it all because of its biased insistence on pleasing the males in the audience."

Loving Adults,7.3/10. Recommended,"This is a good drama/romance/thriller, in the same vein of UNFAITHFUL (2002), FATAL ATTRACTION (1987), A PERFECT MURDER (1998) etc. Actors are not so charismatic/attractive like Gere/Lane, Douglas/Paltrow etc, however they did a very goood job: Acting is one of the strongest aspects of this movie. They are 100% convincing. So is the plot. Everything that happened here is realistic, except for the final 20-ish minutes. Those minutes are the reason i don't rate it even higher, because some events were kinda far-fetched.

Still, this was not a bad ending. Just not as good as the rest of he movie. Overall, it was an exciting and intense movie with characters you can empathize with them, up to a point at least. As a viewer, i felt their hate, love, despair, passion, hope and hopelessness.

It seems to me that Danish cinema is thriving nowadays. Congratulations Denmark."
Loving Adults,Stupid cops but ok,"The first act is weak but then the real mystery starts and the twists are interesting, so you keep watching and invested to know how it will end.

Not an artistic marvellous, but better to pass your time than some of the self-indulgences farts some people try to sell you.

PS: WTF Danish police? Can't you see the petrol station cameras? Doesn't the SPA has any cameras? No traffic cameras? 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️

Loving Adults,A Tangled Web,"""Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when we first practice to deceive."" A frustrated middle-aged married man has an affair with a younger colleague from work. One night, he receives a text message in bed. His wife suspects something. The man attempts to resolve the matter. One of them fails and the other does not. This Danish mystery thriller has more twists than a Hitchcockian turnstile. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Needless to say, this viewer was kept in the dark until the very end, and then he still wasn't sure. But was it really the end? Only some of the characters will ever possibly know."
Loving Adults,Reminds me of CRIMES & MISDEMEANOURS (Woody Allen),"In CRIMES, poor Martin Landau falls into the clutches of a determined & hangry mistress (Anjelica Huston), who threatens to blow the whistle to his family, and also to report a financial indiscretion he committed, if he does not dump his family for her. In LOVING ADULTS, our protagonist, Christian (also a well-to-do professional) is in a similar bind: his pretty mistress, Xenia, also wants to wrench him away from his family, and she, too has knowledge of an indiscretion he has committed. The difference between the 2 plots? Christian is wacky about his mistress; Martin Landau is fed up with his & seeks desperate means to end his problem.

As we discover early in the film, Christian is not so squeamish about ending his 'female' problem, but he chooses a course contrary to Landau's: he decides his pretty & talented (but aging wife) must go. As the story unfolds, as narrated by a local detective, we wait to see if the police can catch the guilty man. CRIMES ended with a very sardonic outcome, free of guilt and discovery. I can't tell you if that happens here, since I am only 40 minutes in, but I think I am going to like it. Oh: A couple of sensual scenes might need fast-forwarding."
Loving Adults,You're being trolled by those rave reviewers!!,"I read all these reviews and kept waiting for this movie to become good, and deliver on those ""twists"" and whatever, but the entire movie was completely nonsensical, with terrible acting, terrible characters and a rehashed plot (BBC's Dr. Foster was much better). I soon realized that those people giving 9 stars must be trolling everyone. The husband character just had a perpetual look of ""I forgot my lines"" or ""Am I on the right set??"" ; there were no redeemable/likable women characters in this; the woman he's having an affair with is just as shrillish a troll as the wife; and even her ""best friend"" totally sells her out. The story being told by a cop to his daughter added nothing to the storyline, and then when you find out where they are and why he's telling the story...I mean, ok, so while that was unexpected, who really gives a crap and that did not add any value to the storyline. There was definitely no suspense at all; the cops were duuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb, and the dubbing was awful. Anyway, please save yourself 2 hours and do not watch this."
Loving Adults,Excellent and terrifying!!!,"WOWWWW!!!! Much better than I expected, perhaps predicted for some, but not for me. I'm not a fan of stories of jealousy and divorce, like soap operas. But none of that, it's very exciting, psychopathic, psychological and terrifying. The two main actors are fantastic! The tension feels raw. The combination of images from start to finish is fantastic, and the story goes from simple to very complicated and scary very quickly. Two selfish psychopaths in a more than vicious circle. This movie blew me away. Don't miss it, and be careful if you don't like horror and creepy stories.

Excellent and terrifying."
Loving Adults,This has to change...,"Great movie... really great!!!

One thing i hate is that in the movie THEY ARE SAYING A WHITE VAN WITH ROMANIAN NUMBER PLATE!!!!!!

DANENARK IS 2000 miles from us... why are they doing this remark's like this????

This is really upsetting for me to watch this and to see that they are doing remarks like this... Why they can they say this.. this is not the first time we see remarks like this. This is absolutely discusting for me to see this.

I think the producers are like: a... what country should we pick... oooo ... i know ... romania........

I don't like to complain but this was really upsetting.

The rest of the movie was great honestly."
Loving Adults,"Interesting turns, then a comical, totally unbelievable ending.","It's like the screenwriter just fell asleep, got drunk, or just decided to assume the viewers would be just as stupid as the characters are start to finish in this weak attempt at what could have been a much better movie without the totally illogical and idiotic conclusion. I won't say more, in case somebody actually just wants to waste a little under two hours of their life on a faux dramatic ending that makes you want to shoot the router so this can never happen to you again. Either that, or Danish police make the Keystone Cops look like geniuses.

Also, it doesn't help that the overdubbing into English is done by people that clearly are working without the benefit of actually seeing the film. Never heard such flat, emotionless 'voice acting' before."

Loving Adults,Predictions don't do to this movie,"Crime story by a Police Father as unsolved case and his mounting suspicions with many twists - turns though known human weaknesses and wises explored. Couple if remain to get her in even bilateral crime experience give lot of loopholes in investigations. Morally we may not agree any thing that favors crime but loop holes the mind set finds is amazing. This film is amongst top 50 thrillers Netflix gave us and people liked. Gore,Sex, Betrayal, family bonds, son sick, sabotage all explored with superbly carved out direction editing screen play music all ingredients justified. Commenting on end result may dilute the suspense thrill but Modern Juris Prudence is almost impossible to overcome."

The story being told by a cop to his daughter added nothing to the storyline, and then when you find out where they are and why he's telling the story...I mean, ok, so while that was unexpected, who really gives a crap and that did not add any value to the storyline. There was definitely no suspense at all; the cops were duuuuuuuuuuuuuuumb, and the dubbing was awful. Anyway, please save yourself 2 hours and do not watch this."
Last Hope,Excellent and terrifying!!!,"WOWWWW!!!! Much better than I expected, perhaps predicted for some, but not for me. I'm not a fan of stories of jealousy and divorce, like soap operas. But none of that, it's very exciting, psychopathic, psychological and terrifying. The two main actors are fantastic! The tension feels raw. The combination of images from start to finish is fantastic, and the story goes from simple to very complicated and scary very quickly. Two selfish psychopaths in a more than vicious circle. This movie blew me away. Don't miss it, and be careful if you don't like horror and creepy stories.

Excellent and terrifying."
Last Hope,This has to change...,"Great movie... really great!!!

One thing i hate is that in the movie THEY ARE SAYING A WHITE VAN WITH ROMANIAN NUMBER PLATE!!!!!!

DANENARK IS 2000 miles from us... why are they doing this remark's like this????

This is really upsetting for me to watch this and to see that they are doing remarks like this... Why they can they say this.. this is not the first time we see remarks like this. This is absolutely discusting for me to see this.

I think the producers are like: a... what country should we pick... oooo ... i know ... romania........

I don't like to complain but this was really upsetting.

The rest of the movie was great honestly."
Last Hope,"Interesting turns, then a comical, totally unbelievable ending.","It's like the screenwriter just fell asleep, got drunk, or just decided to assume the viewers would be just as stupid as the characters are start to finish in this weak attempt at what could have been a much better movie without the totally illogical and idiotic conclusion. I won't say more, in case somebody actually just wants to waste a little under two hours of their life on a faux dramatic ending that makes you want to shoot the router so this can never happen to you again. Either that, or Danish police make the Keystone Cops look like geniuses.

Also, it doesn't help that the overdubbing into English is done by people that clearly are working without the benefit of actually seeing the film. Never heard such flat, emotionless 'voice acting' before."

Last Hope,Predictions don't do to this movie,"Crime story by a Police Father as unsolved case and his mounting suspicions with many twists - turns though known human weaknesses and wises explored. Couple if remain to get her in even bilateral crime experience give lot of loopholes in investigations. Morally we may not agree any thing that favors crime but loop holes the mind set finds is amazing. This film is amongst top 50 thrillers Netflix gave us and people liked. Gore,Sex, Betrayal, family bonds, son sick, sabotage all explored with superbly carved out direction editing screen play music all ingredients justified. Commenting on end result may dilute the suspense thrill but Modern Juris Prudence is almost impossible to overcome."

Drug Lords,Watchable,"As usual with this kind of series some of the episodes are more interesting than others. The best episodes were the Colombian based ones, El Chapo from Mexico and the ones that put me to sleep were the Frank. Lucas and Christopher Coke episodes. Still this is a decent series. Worth watching."
Drug Lords,"Scariest Grandma ever, is a Sheila","Interesting documenty to view if you have watched narcos, or if you have watched this watch narcos.

Sad thing no Angel Félix who within 3 series you thought Netflix would have hit upon by now if only to push Narcos Mexico

Anyway from The Gentleman of to the thugish queen of crack, Pablo to El Chapo this is informed if sometimes over inflated egos who speak for themselves.

Worth a watch"
Drug Lords,It could have been better but it can be entertaining,"The characters portrayed probably had a life full of interesting details, but that seems to be wasted and this series rarely gets you enthusiastic. It's not that those guys should be glamorized or that the series should take a sensationalist approach, but some greater detail would do well. Episodes are long but lack information density. Those simulation scenes could have been more well performed, especially with better actors. Or they could just have not been made at all, or even be replaced by cartoon. It's interesting - even indispensable - to interview those who were directly involved in the events portrayed (the cops and the gangsters), but it would be very nice to also hear some of the people who were indirectly affected by their actions and also some experts. This series can be entertaining, but it leaves you with the feeling that something much better could have been done with its subject matter."
Drug Lords,Another Late Adopter on the Escobar Train,"Just what we need, another docudrama about the world's Drug Lords. Still, I thought that perhaps with the overwhelmingly large recent canon of the Medellin Cartel syndicate contributions like: Alias J.J., Narco's, El Chapo, Escobar, and Loving Pablo, a series to hit on the other key players may be striking while the iron is hot; but to my dismay, it's just a tired underwhelming attempt to copy what's already been done time and again. My advice is to read the book written by hitman Jairo Velásquez as well as Chasing Pablo by Marquez and don't waste your time on this drivel."
Drug Lords,WHAT?...WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?,Might have some good info but whatever this show is trying to convey is lost through the very distracting and unending Inception music... every word that is uttered is met with annoying overdramatic loud music
Drug Lords,"A lot of bad information, and IMPORTANT things left out..",Comentario no disponible
Drug Lords,more biased pro US pro DEA misinformation,"Doesn't show truth at all.

DEA supported cartels in Mexico and Columbia then blame the cartels for the huge addiction in US. The documentary is too biased and barely resembles truth or facts."

Queer Eye,This show just keeps getting better,"As entertaining as the original was, the new version is even better - and it gets better with each season.

Aside from the laugh out loud moments, and genuine warmth that permeates each episode, the overwhelming feeling that the viewer gets from the Fab Five (individually and collectively) is kindness.

While many reality shows focus on the least appealing aspects of human nature, Queer Eye focuses on the best."
Queer Eye,"Fun, emotional and binge-worthy!","Not being too old when the original season aired, I was unfamiliar with the concept of this show, so when I saw all 8 episodes had been added to Netflix I had no idea what to expect. I was so pleasantly surprised.

The show is life-affirming and emotional. Whilst at times the guys seem a little too intrusive and border on being overly judgemental, they win me, and the people they're there to help, over with their charm, friendship and emotional support. Their chemistry and friendship brings a smile to my face and really is magic. The way they allowed others and themselves to open up was a privilege to see, and I have come away from each episode with a smile on my face.

Definitely worth a watch, the first episode with Tom had me beaming, sobbing and awwing. A true delight."
Queer Eye,all the negative reviews have something in common.,"The small handful of negative reviews I've read seem to take issue with Jonathan's flamboyancy, but a lot of these critics are self-proclaimed gay men who have a problem with ""negative gay stereotypes."" I'm here to tell you there is nothing innately negative about flamboyancy other than the fact that our society deemed all things associated with femininity as inferior. In other words, those reviewers are projecting their own self-hate and internalized homophobia onto this show, and their reviews reflects their own baggage, NOT the quality of the show. So what if Jonathan is a bit extra? If you can't learn to find him endearing, admire his unapologetic courage, or appreciate how he really rounds out the spectrum of masculinity displayed on the cast, you won't see how much of an essential part he is to the show's theme of acceptance in the diversity of people.

That aside, the design transformations are aesthetically on point, incredibly tasteful and thoughtfully custom-tailored to the hero subjects. And, the best part is, the show has a lot of heart. It is uplifting and motivating--it transcends outer beauty as it promotes self-care, self-respect, self-confidence and self-worth, but also love and acceptance in a toxic culture. It's a feel-good without the escapism which makes for a cathartic viewing experience."
Queer Eye,Not expected.,"Usually I research a lot before I watch a movie or a show, but I pick this show randomly. And I gotta say: this is the best thing I've watched in a LONG time. I've wondering why I was so blowed away by this (and I'm a straight guy) and I realise it's because it is real. Of course there are some unnatural scenes, like extrapolation or disconfort in front of the cameras, and whatever, but The Fab Five are not professional actors, they are themselves doing and living what they believe, and the guys chosen are real people, working their dreams and fears in between the scenes. I laughed, I wondered, I felt alive watching this (and I even cry). Wonderful job to everyone involved in the show. Thank you."
Queer Eye,On point!,"I fell in love with this show and the 5 guys the very first episode. I cannot wait for the next season! Everything is on point; the sense of humour, the taste, the discussions, the characters and I love the respect for everyone involved. A really touching and entertaining show! Give it a try :)"
Queer Eye,God Bless Gays,Everyone that has a negative opinion or thinking of the LGBT community...watch this. I'm a Christian and my Jesus never once told me to hate on gays. They are genuine and real...more than most ppl I know anyways!
Queer Eye,A true ray of sunshine in a bleak world,"Considering how dark and bleak everything can seem at times, Queer Eye has such a true, heartwarming quality about it that is hard to come by.

The inclusivity, diversity and the respect for all of it is amazing. The way this group reaches out to not only expand people's views on what, for an example, masculinity is and can be, but also to expand their own mindsets about things, is truly priceless. This is a show of diversity, kindness and spreading joy, and I love every bit of it.

There's not a single episode that would've left me dry-eyed and there's not a single person I would not recommend this to. All in all, Queer Eye is 100% a show that is current and important, and definitely worth the watch."
Queer Eye,It's everything we hoped for!,"The show is sweet, funny, charming, and the best part is the dialogue being had about race, religion and mutual respect, is what's most important. We loved it!"
Queer Eye,THANK YOU!,"Jonathan Ness makes every gray or sad day shine bright like the sun. He alone is worth giving the show ten stars. But all five of this heart warming, kind, smart, handsome and caring guys make pure magic out if this show. Me and my ten year old daughter always watch this together, and we smile, cry, laugh, hug and cry again. We have been through a lot and this show is like medicine for our souls. THANK YOU!"
Queer Eye,Super fun and touching!,The minute the show started it brought all the good memories I had with the previous show. I had so much fun watching it! The cast seems to get along great and they are all super fun and excited in helping these guys - despite what I read about ir here on making fun of them first. Guys tease each other all the time and at any moment they said mean things like fat or ugly... I bing watched it and I can't wait for season 2!!! P.S. I laughed so hard with Jonathan and the mattress scene! He is the new Carlson only a little bit more outrageous! loved it!
Queer Eye,So happy this show is back,"Just like the original show, you guys are so kind! You just put a smile on my face! I am 65 years old and a straight white female. I have just fallen in love with the Fab 5."
Queer Eye,My patience wore thin,"I quite enjoyed season one, but I had to give up in season two.

My main issue is that it has become allllll about the hosts. An opportunity to get on their soapboxes and spout about themselves and whatever other topic crosses their way.

The episode where they worked with a police officer was particularly uncomfortable for me as one of the hosts was almost putting their guest on trial.

The original series had quirky charm and I don't remember it being so focused on the hosts' agendas.

It should be sweep in, improve someone's life and move on. Inspire people and have fun doing it.

As a gay guy I am sympathetic to some need to raise awareness and increase tolerance... but to me indulging the hosts and not focusing on the guests is the wrong way to do it."
Queer Eye,Forced Joy. Pop Consumerism.,"Some episodes are breezy casual fun and others are inspiring and sweet but it's just a bit too inauthentic, manufactured and forced for me.

The friendship between the crew feels forced sometimes and some of the people being made over seemed like they're being forced into awkward or intimate moments.

Yes, it's sweet and joyful but also kind of vapid and shallow. It's about objects, clothes and googled recipes, pretty wrapping paper over deep issues.

Even though it's largely forced at least we get to see real everyday people, some with rich personalities, experiencing magic and their potential.

If you're choosy about episodes and pick the more mellow few, it's okay."
Queer Eye,Definitely worth watching it!!!,"Please disregard the bad comments and watch just one episode, if you don't like it, switch to another series.

As for me, it's inspirational, it tackled some of my issues and above it all, it made me feel much better. Definitely worth watching it!!!"
Queer Eye,Good show to be honest,Comentario no disponible
Queer Eye,"This show made me smile, laugh and ugly cry. The Best!","Literally made an account for this show bc I'm so mad at all the negative comments about Jonathan. He has been on other creative platforms and this is just his personality. I for one love it and it brings so much light and humor to the show. And for the record saying ""I'm a gay man"" does not equal a free pass to be a judgemental asshole. This show is amazing. From the very first episode I was hooked. The guys they makeover are so sweet and touching. And they really do give them so much more than a makeover."
Queer Eye,Why Be Sad About The Current State Of America When You Could Watch Queer Eyes,"I've never watched a show before that has made me cry, learn about the importance of beard grooming and made me want to believe in humanity again. That was until I watch Queer Eye. The critics are right in saying that this is what the world needs right now. From fashion tips to encouraging words from mature, wise, funny, amazing gay men, this is what we've all been waiting for. I (almost) would like to describe this show as an ointment for sadness and tears. I watch an episode as often as possible because of the hope it gives me. I have never rated a movie about an eight but this show deserves, earned, a ten!"
Queer Eye,love it,"I am not gay and I love this show. It has it all. It's light, funny, drama, If you tried hard enough you could find something you like about the show, I love the makeovers and the way these guys talk to people. It's just amazing. Forget the negative reviews on this show and watch it for yourself."
Queer Eye,My Daughter Made Me Watch It,"I had no interest in seeing the revamped version of Queer Eye which I assumed would be more of the same, and I see enough snarkiness on Twitter. Of course I was dead wrong as my huge fan daughter showed me. The warmth, love and respect the Fab Five show the weekly subject is life-affirming. I know that editing is showing me what it wants me to see but it apparently wants to show good people doing good things with joy and acceptance while allowing the very diverse group of guests learn to love themselves. Colorful, funny, kind and great design and clothing advice - what's not to like?"
Queer Eye,Powerful show that shows true power of LGBT community!,"Queer Eye to me, the first time I saw it I thought it was some sort of cheesy documentary but was I wrong. Queer Eye is such an inspirational show that takes 5 men of the LGBT community who have a mission to help change other men's lives. The show has a good blend of inspiration and comedy at the same time as the guys have a very upbeat and happy personality. Now would I say some of it is kinda stupid? yes. But, stupid can be good right? And in this case it sure is. I would say out of all netflix original series, this would be on my top 5 no doubt. If you need a show with a lot of heart and comedy, Queer Eye is for sure one to watch."
Queer Eye,Unexpected and Surprisingly Emotional!,"I was referred to this show by an individual very important to me and was deeply surprised by how much I loved it. There is such a therapeutic aspect to the show and it talks about important modern world issues such as racism, gun control and of course homophobia.

Each member of the Fab Five is amazing because each one is able to have deep, meaningful conversations with someone they are attempting to help. The Fab Five have experienced addiction, homelessness and horrible pressures from their families. The show gives me so much hope that there are actually human beings who can be kind and care for others in a sincere way.

I thought I would hate the show, but I always feel lighter after watching it. I highly suggest that you try it out. Please watch it!!!"
Queer Eye,When life shocks you.....,"What I find absolutely astounding upon reading the reviews for Queer Eye are the homophobic comments made by gay men! This has shocked me somewhat. Yes you CAN be homophobic if you're gay it seems. This show focuses a lot on bullying and it's rife in these comments against a particular cast member (whom I absolutely adore). I feel sick knowing in 2022 a community doesn't have one another's backs and is being critical towards members of their own community. You should be ashamed of yourselves. This show isn't for you. It's for accepting, understanding, warm and empathic people who are willing to accept people for who they are.

This show is a ten for me! Love it!"

Queer Eye,Not as Good as the Original,"This new series just does not nearly hold a candle to the original series. That's not to say I do not like it, but it's just not nearly as good.

I did not get a chance to watch this series when it originally aired, because I was so far in the closet that I was in Narnia. Having being stuck in hospital, and after bringing this new series, I thought I'd binge the original Queer Eye.

The original Fab 5 were mostly professionals (except Jai), who thoroughly understood their skills prior to the series. Thom is, hands down, one of the best interior designers I've ever witnessed. And do not even get me started on the comparisons of Antoni v. Ted... My wife is a former chef, and her frustration in Antoni is just... Jonathan van Ness is, I suppose, an intent to replace Carson, but there are massive differences between the two. Carson is an outstanding stylist, who really knew what he was doing, while adding a bit of femme flaire and quick-witted hilarity. Van Ness tries to also bring that flaire, but at the level of a nine-year-old. He's just not funny. And he just constantly seems to scream for attention. I adore Carson - van Ness, not so much. Now, I did say Jai maybe was not on the level of the others, but he still did a fantastic job as ""culture guru"".

Perhaps my biggest disappointment in the new Fab 5 is that they try to completely change their ""clients"" style, whereas the original Fab 5 were set on just updating their style. I don't get this sense that the new Fab 5 know what they're doing, nor even care about the people they are supposed to help. In fact, it seems to me like they care more about dancing, etc. in front of the camera.

I also do not get the sense that these guys are even close to each other like the original were. The original still keep in regular contact. Carson and Thom even had their own series a couple of years ago.

The only positives I take away that the new series is a) more inclusive, and b) Tan (he's awesome)."
Queer Eye,My favorite show ever,This show is amazing. Never seen a show so positive and endearing. I could watch a million episodes and never get tired of it
The Promised Neverland,Don't watch the second season.,"First season: absolutely thrilling and amazing concept. Definitely one of the best anime from 2019.

Second season: what where the writers thinking! They screwed it up. Such a downgrade from the first season, it's embarrassing. You really can just stop after you finish the first season. You're not missing out on anything.

Overall rating: 7.1."
The Promised Neverland,Ignore the second season,"I would put a 9/10 of it was only season 1 but the second season is god awful, stay as far away as possible."
The Promised Neverland,Brilliant Horror Anime,"I realize I might be jumping the gun a bit, calling it ""brilliant"" when only two episodes have been released so far, but so far its pretty great. I don't want to spoil anything, seeing as how this is a show where you definitely don't want to know what is going on beforehand, but I will say that it is pretty intense.

The animation is pretty amazing. I have seen very few other anime where the camera regularly moves around 2D environments like this. Its very impressively drawn.

----

Ok, season one is over now. This show is awesome and I look forward to season two coming out."
The Promised Neverland,Brilliantly done,"This show is already one of my favorites. The first season is more of a psychological thriller and the writers are patient in letting the plot develop. The main characters are very smart and cautious, and their opponents are equally as cunning, giving the first season of the show a similar ""battle of the minds"" vibe as Death Note. I am looking forward to future seasons, especially given how good the manga is."
The Promised Neverland,Absolutely amazing!,"For me, it kept me on the edge right from episode 1! I love the animation and how they're able to work around such a thrilling plot that will have you guessing what will happen next episode. This series is just awesome!"
The Promised Neverland,"Skip Season 2, just read the manga, or don't, as long as you don't watch S2","S1 is a 10 S2 is a 4

Average is 7, since this website is adamant about not letting us rate seasons individually."
The Promised Neverland,Watch the S1 to see a masterpice and watch the S2 to see how a masterpice turn into a TRASH,"I saw the S1 and it was a great anime. And I saw the S2 and I realized how a masterpiece can reach the depths of the sewer . I consider that there is no S2.

But honestly, I didn't read the manga So the second season wasn't so bad to me. But the storyline has so many holes that it goes on as if it does not exist at all. There is not the slightest sign of the element of horror in the S2."
The Promised Neverland,Simply amazing,"The story, the backgrounds, the characters, that plot twist at the start... The deepness of this story is touching. And the adaptation and animation are excellent. Congratulations, CloverWorks."
The Promised Neverland,"Most of the animes does not deserve to be entered in the Top 250 IMDB list, but this one deserves it and deservedly","Most of the animes does not deserve to be entered in the Top 250 IMDB list, but this one deserves it and deservedly There are not many words to describe this anime, in terms of the drawing, the drawing is clear and beautiful and in terms of intelligence, I can say that it is similar to Death Note (you can see my list about the shows that resemble Death Note) and Neverland is one of them. The most important thing in the show is music and songs, and the best word to describe them is addiction, especially intro. The first 6 episodes were modest, but I advise you to watch it all at once, and with each episode, the anime will become more wonderful. The best episode is 11 with a rating of 9.6 and then the last. I hope that the second season maintains the distinction of the first season My rating is 9.4"
The Promised Neverland,"Thrilling, Emotional and Unique storyline..Amazing characters",This anime packs a punch...just watched it by chance...characters are witty and story keeps u interested till the last episode.. waiting for the next season <3
The Promised Neverland,Stop after season one!!!,"The second season dropped significantly in quality. While every moment from season one seams to have a purpose leading to a big reveal, season two just wanders around aimlessly and is mostly cringy and unpleasant to watch. Season two is so much worse than the first one that it actually worsens the whole experience."

The Promised Neverland,Disappointed.,"S1 was outstanding! And the first 3 episodes of S2 are great, but after episode 4 wtf happened. I didn't even read the manga, yet I'm still disappointed. For me the series was too rush and it could have been better. The last time I was this disappointed was S8 of GoT. I guess I'm gonna read the manga to fill the void the series left me with, because it looks like the series won't have another season."
The Promised Neverland,"First Season was great, second not so much.","The first season was a horror slow based thriller, the second ended up being something of an extremely fast paced action that didn't even go off the manga. The only reason I'm rating this a five is because the first season was so good. The second season was a huge letdown that time skipped important scenes that would've shown character development and a more clear understanding of how the children where able to get to their final destination. Not worth the watch."
The Promised Neverland,Wow this show blew me away,"I don't ever write reviews for anything on here but I just finished the finale of S1 and I am blown away.

I cannot recommend this show enough, death note was the first anime I ever watched many years ago and since then I have been looking for a show that was just as smart as it. This is the show.

The plots are not similar in any means but the thought process, battle of the minds, and the way information and twists are revealed heavily reminded me of death note.

The Japanese voice acting is superb, any fans of Hunter x Hunter will instantly recognize the voice of Killua who voices Ray in this show.

If you need a new anime to watch, this is the one."

The Promised Neverland,Creative narrative,"It was everything was amazing the story, the soundtrack, the characters.

The writer was quite creative he can change your impression about any character in one episode"
The Promised Neverland,One of the best animes of last years,Great! Adventure and suspense in the right measure. Charismatic characters. A breath in the midst of so many low quality animes.
The Promised Neverland,Great anime adaptation of a great manga,"What happens when you mix the epic games of wits, strategies and dialogue from Death Note with the world building, violence and mystery of both Attack on Titan and Made in Abyss and then you add a bit of your own creativity to it? Well you get The Promised Neverland. Now, I am not trying to say this show is a copy of the other three I previously mention, is just that this show takes all these elements and mix them to create a very original and brilliant show.

Because this show has so many twists (even the main plot is a plotwist itself) I will focus very little on the plot. This show is about a bunch of kids living in an orphanage, they have live there for their entire life, knowing nothing about the rest of the world and the only adult they have ever seen is the woman that takes care of them which they call Mom. The story focus one the three older kids in the orphanage called Emma, Ray and Norman who after discovering the true about their home are forced to take action. I gotta say that this three kids are one of the best team of characters I have ever seen in any anime. All three kid are incredible smart but Emma is the one who's definitely less intelligent than there other two but what she lacks in intelligence she has in heart, guts and determination. Ray is the more objective but also the most manipulative and cunning of the three while also been extremely smart. Norman could be consider the smartest of all the kids but he also cares deeply for all the children, especially for Emma and Ray. There are also some other kids who are very solid characters but the main three kids have a way better character development. Speaking of great characters, both Mom and another character introduce latter called Sister Krone are also really damm good. Is because of the variety of characters that sometimes we can watch some genius plans like in Death Note, other times we get mystery and world building and other times we gruesome and nightmare fuel scenes like in Attack on Titan or Made in Abyss.

The art and animation in this show is beautiful, not the best in the industry but is still pretty damm solid. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible because is perfect for every different type of scenes that we can watch in this show.

Overall, this show was amazing, it did cut some parts of the manga (the inner thoughts and monologues of the characters been one of those things) which still leave the manga as the superior version of the story but I believe this anime was still a very successful adaptation. I can't wait for 2020 to watch season 2! Update: DON'T watch season 2, it awful, watch season one and then read the manga."
The Promised Neverland,Perfect series,"What a series!

It's really awesome!

I recommend such a beautiful animation for whom love these types of mystery."
The Promised Neverland,Best Anime of the year (THE PROMISED NEVERLAND),"I began watching this with great expectations that were quickly surpassed by an incredible adaptation that combines great voice acting, suspense, top-notch animation and certain psychological thriller elements to tell its amazing story.

This is surely one of the best Anime of 2019"

The Promised Neverland,This ish right here?,"This is one of the most interesting anime's i've seen on the dark side since Monster and Death Note. I don't know where to start. Just extremely amazing. This would be a very good live movie. I'm waiting for new episodes. This is mouth watering mysterious, dramatic and suspensful. Gosh i'm glad i was bored and clicked on it."
The Promised Neverland,Shame about all that,"9/10 season 1 4/10 season 2 Split the difference really.

Will be leaving you scratching your head and saying ""really, we had all that build up, all those characters, all those plot points, and we just plumb forget about them for the ending"" an ending that makes little in the way of sense as well. No real idea what went wrong but something certainly collapsed in production. Kind of feel bad for the people who worked on it as there is some very nice art but the story disappoints in the latter third."
The Promised Neverland,Fantatic horror anime as well as the manga,"I honestly think its the best series ever been created for a long time, I couldnt help myself but stopped at the 4th episode and moved onto the manga already like guys, its so amazing!

This is totally like Peter Pan but on a totally different darker level!

Seriously lads, go watch the anime or read the manga, you are missing out a great series if you haven't checked it out already!"

Nobody Knows I'm Here,A Lovely Exploration of a Tortured Soul,"I thought this was a beautiful exploration of a tortured soul. The unfurling of the central character, and the girl who comes to love him, was sensitively played by both actors. The gentle teasing out of Memo's life by Jorge Garcia was a joy to watch. You shouldn't expect a traditional fast paced action film as that's not what this is but if you like character driven film then you'll enjoy this. With a satisfying end and some beautiful scenery and a performance full of emotion, I would recommend this film for a lazy Sunday evening."
Nobody Knows I'm Here,If you can't relate to the main character then...,"Yes, the movie is slow but in that slow pace is the beauty of the movie. Not many adults in our contemporary society are equipped to show or express feelings and emotions, now imagine a young man, you can't expect this from a young man. The beauty is in the silence, scenery, the hard work in the skin shop. Everything is implicit and if you can't connect or relate to the main character then you will miss the messages in the plot. Even at the end we can see the grandiose hypocrisy of people and the ignorance and greed of people."
Nobody Knows I'm Here,A cautionary tale,"Since I am not (and will never be) famous, I am fascinated by the quest of many people to achieve fame. What is equally fascinating is the aftermath of fame. Nobody Knows I'm here is a wonderfully accomplished look into the exploitation of Chilean singer Memo. With a golden voice, it appears he is headed for a life of fame and glory. However, his success is short-lived and his subsequent life becomes a study in adapting and accepting the life that he has been given. This movie (contrary to some reviewers) unfolds in a perfect pace. (As a side note, I am a bit perplexed that many reviews equate scenes of dialogue with the notion that nothing is happening. As if their own lives were boring and a waste of time since they lack car chases, explosions and shootouts.) Along the way, many things happen in this movie that are un-expected, but, not un-believable. This is a credit to the Gaspar Antillo's superb directing.

Nobody Knows I'm Here,Good movie,"Beautiful scenery, understated emotional subject matter. A little slow at the beginning but worth watching"
Nobody Knows I'm Here,Very good film,It is a very good film with very beautiful landscape of the south of Chile. The plot is good and the screenplay too. I had a very good time watching it. I highly recommend.
Nobody Knows I'm Here,A parsimonious drama,"A Chilean drama. It is about a man who lives alone with his uncle, but who lent his voice to a singer as a Child and is discovered by a girl from the town. The film portrays everyday and monotonous life in a spectacular way. In fact, although the first half hour is very slow and nothing seems to be happening, the daily portrait of life is fascinating. This movie is not for everyone. It is about frustrated dreams, pain, bad life decisions, not knowing how to face what we do and what we are. The character is dramatically armed, his psychology and the way he breaks free is fabulous. The best thing about the film is the second and third act. At times the audio is quite hasty and not everything is understood. In Spanish. Quality"
Nobody Knows I'm Here,Everbody has to know this film is here,"Astonishing piece of emotional cinematography. Hidden out there in Chile away from overated Holywood productions.

Everybody has to know this film is here."

Nobody Knows I'm Here,The film ended just when I thought it would get better :(,"It is worth it because it is a tender story and also the beautiful landscape of my country gives it an extra credit.

Nobody Knows I'm Here,Lovely,Beautiful movie about a guy who struggles with his past presented in a lovely and touching way. Beautiful and atmospheric shots of the southern chilean landscape.
Nobody Knows I'm Here,"Not bad, could have been better.","A beautifully photographed and well-acted drama from Chile that ultimately disappoints.

The story of Memo, a quiet giant of a man living in seclusion with his uncle in southern Chile. In his youth his dreams of fame were taken from him by his greedy father and an unscrupulous record producer. When he starts to interact with modern society his secrets come tumbling out.

There's a lot of silence in this film, and plenty of lingering shots of the stunning Chilean scenery that eventually make the film drag. Jorge Garcia is good as the hurt Memo, though at times he comes across as a petulant child. Maybe this is because his childhood was stolen from him, I don't know. Luis Gnecco is excellent as always as his loving uncle.

My biggest criticism is that Memo's secret has been kept quiet for so long, particularly after a pivotal flashback halfway through the film shows just how famous (or infamous) he was. That spoiled it for me.

Overall, it's a quiet, thoughtful drama with a title song that will stick in your head for days afterwards."

Nobody Knows I'm Here,Beautiful drama of regret and redemption set in Chile.,"""In solitude the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon itself."" Laurence Sterne

A lyrical drama from Chile comes at a time when loneliness and disappointment need to be beaten back. Nobody Knows I'm Here tells of a gifted young Chilean boy, Memo (older memo is played by Lost's Jorge Garcia), whose voice his father sells to promoters of another slimmer, handsomer young performer. Jorge spends his adult life as a sheep farmer remembering the promise of his voice and the betrayal of his father.

The poignancy is that Memo withdraws from society with only his memory and his still formidable voice. Writer/director Gaspar Antillo keeps this intriguing drama from becoming maudlin or overly melancholic by juxtaposing the minimalist house and barn on an island near Llanquihue in southern Chile-the drone shots expose the extreme, lush beauty while the closeups show how his past has imprisoned him in himself.

For anyone who has ever felt alone with regrets from the past that daily haunt, no poetic film could do more than this to express the personal pain and the longing to be released. Memo's voice, which he practices all the time, and the costumes he makes for imaginary performances form the basis of his resilience.

Then add substitute postmistress Marta (Millaray Lobos), who draws Memo out of his memories, and hope blooms. Although she's not particularly beautiful, she exudes care and selflessness coupled with an odd love of Memo, given his enormous size and solitude. Two outliers meant for each other.

It's a surprise that smart phones and the Internet play an integral part in Memo's deliverance, ushering him into the 21st Century and a healthy relationship with his past and his future."

The location of the film was amazing, beautiful scenery, the original song that is also the title of the film is good, the performance by Jorge Garcia was good but overall it's quite disappointing."
Nobody Knows I'm Here,We need an avalanche of movies like this!,"I defend this movie because we have a lot of garbage receiving glory for nothing! Jorge Garcia was very well....

Fary: Hexagone,A Lovely Exploration of a Tortured Soul,"I thought this was a beautiful exploration of a tortured soul. The unfurling of the central character, and the girl who comes to love him, was sensitively played by both actors. The gentle teasing out of Memo's life by Jorge Garcia was a joy to watch. You shouldn't expect a traditional fast paced action film as that's not what this is but if you like character driven film then you'll enjoy this. With a satisfying end and some beautiful scenery and a performance full of emotion, I would recommend this film for a lazy Sunday evening."
Fary: Hexagone,If you can't relate to the main character then...,"Yes, the movie is slow but in that slow pace is the beauty of the movie. Not many adults in our contemporary society are equipped to show or express feelings and emotions, now imagine a young man, you can't expect this from a young man. The beauty is in the silence, scenery, the hard work in the skin shop. Everything is implicit and if you can't connect or relate to the main character then you will miss the messages in the plot. Even at the end we can see the grandiose hypocrisy of people and the ignorance and greed of people."
Fary: Hexagone,A cautionary tale,"Since I am not (and will never be) famous, I am fascinated by the quest of many people to achieve fame. What is equally fascinating is the aftermath of fame. Nobody Knows I'm here is a wonderfully accomplished look into the exploitation of Chilean singer Memo. With a golden voice, it appears he is headed for a life of fame and glory. However, his success is short-lived and his subsequent life becomes a study in adapting and accepting the life that he has been given. This movie (contrary to some reviewers) unfolds in a perfect pace. (As a side note, I am a bit perplexed that many reviews equate scenes of dialogue with the notion that nothing is happening. As if their own lives were boring and a waste of time since they lack car chases, explosions and shootouts.) Along the way, many things happen in this movie that are un-expected, but, not un-believable. This is a credit to the Gaspar Antillo's superb directing. If you are looking for a beautifully depicted slice of life set in the lush Chilean country side, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie."

Descendant,History as a nightmare.,"If a person knew very little about slavery and the slave trade, this documentary would be a great shock and revelation. Since my earliest student days, however, the slave trade between Africa and the ""Americas"" stood high profile with me. It still does.

By focusing on the voyage of the ""Clotilda"", it being the last or one of the last slavers, and the descendance of its human cargo, it manages to cover the utterly dismal topic sufficiently. Grinning white people in suits referring to the reconstructive drawing of the ""Clotilda"" as ""Wonderful"" have no place in this story. This story belongs to African Americans, and how they were so late in history, abducted to the Americas by greedy white men.

These same men, and they were men, who now hold all the money and land from this outrage now are riding a gravy train of financial advantage. Overall, the abomination against humanity that was the entirety of the Africa-Americas slave business will remain a bleeding sore on our society until reparations are made. Now that would be a wonderful picture.

(Irving Warner)"
Descendant,A Revelatory Piece of Filmmaking,"Contrary to widely held belief, just because the US slave trade was outlawed in 1808, that didn't end attempts to continue to import African slaves thereafter. It wasn't until 1860, when the last slave ship, the Clotilde, entered American waters with a hold full of slaves that the practice finally came to an end. And, to conceal this crime, which was punishable by death, the perpetrators scuttled the ship by burning it upon arrival. The location of the wreckage long remained a mystery until a diving team found it in shallow water just north of Mobile, AL in 2018-19. But the discovery was more than just an archaeological curiosity; it was also significant to the descendants of the Clotilde slaves, many of whom settled in a nearby community called Africatown when they achieved freedom after the Civil War in 1865. Those living today now have actual proof of their African lineage, as well as evidence of the crime that was committed against their ancestors. Director Margaret Brown's fourth feature outing explores this story from multiple angles in terms of its historic and personal importance, as well as from all of the fallout that stemmed from their ancestors' experience that has carried through to this day. Given the myriad threads presented in this documentary, the focus admittedly could have been a little tighter in spots, particularly in terms of how the narrative's many dots connect. But, that aside, the film effectively chronicles a little-known story that represents a significant benchmark in African-American history and a potential turning point in terms of how the American public at large views the question of this appalling institution and its after-effects, some of which have lingered but have gone virtually unaddressed and, arguably, even unrecognized all these years. This is a fine film that should be part of every grade school history class and a welcome addition to African-American History Month viewing."
Descendant,"I ignore 1, 2, and 3 star reviews and I'm glad I did on this one.","The polluting factories and the highway that destroyed the Downtown area of Africatown are just other facts that help validate what the descendants are saying. Historians use oral histories as part of their research - this is a common practice. A lot of people don't want you to see this documentary. They are afraid of how it will make them look. They are afraid that it will explain someone's situation. This is one of the reasons I watched the documentary. It explains so much about the Bible Belt south. If you care about American history at all, you will find this documentary rewarding. Watch it and decide for yourself."
Descendant,Tremendous History That Should Never Be Forgotten!,"This is truly, deeply, sincerely an important piece of US History and an amazing story. The Clotilda and Africatown are remarkable and should be revered. The Clotilda is an extremely rare find that should be a National Monument. But of course - this represents a lot more than just the story of a ship!

I live in Mobile. I know these places! There have been a couple of documentaries now, about the Clotilda - and I have been excited to see them both; however, unfortunately - I don't think anyone has quite hit the mark yet when it comes to telling and presenting this story with the impact it deserves, but this wasn't bad - I enjoyed it - the story and the people are incredible - but I'm still waiting for a Clotilda show that tells it all with the passion and excitement to do this justice."
Descendant,Interview Descendants Before It's Too Late,"This documentary is top notch. As anyone who has ever looked into their family history can tell you, the single most important resource genealogists have available to them is descendants. Many of us remember family stories passed to us from our parents & grandparents and many of those stories were passed to them by their parents & grandparents. In many cases the only historical records available are those stories passed generation to generation. The Christian Bible is a prime example of the importance of those stores passed thru the generations. The first Bible began taking shape about 600 years after the death of Christ so one can reasonably assess that the entire Christian Bible is based on stories passed down from generation to generation to generation. Is it possible that one, or more, of those story tellers might have exaggerated a bit? Probably - Just as the story of Lincoln scribbling the Gettysburg Address on the back of envelope isn't true. It is even possible the person documenting the story exaggerated for some reason - maybe even to make their story more appealing or even to satisfy a financial sponsor as with Washington's cherry tree story. In any case, the slaves brought over on the Clotilda deserve to be remembered and as with the Bible, each of us is free to determine what we believe."
Descendant,A fascinating documentary,"I found this to be a fascinating documentary, that held my attention throughout.

That said, it left me with some unanswered questions, in part because of its format, which focused on interviews with people who lived in Africatown, near where the Clotilda, evidently the last slave ship to arrive in the United States, landed.

I can completely understand why the director and producer would want to give these people a chance to express their views and feelings. They had been ignored for so long.

And I know that documentaries can only be so long before viewers start to turn out and off.

But I would have liked more background about a variety of issues. Do we know anything about the Clotilda's route to the States? Do we know where in Africa it left from? Have any of the descendants taken DNA tests that would help with this?

What was life like for the descendants of the original slaves between the time of Emancipation and today?

And on and on.

None of that is a criticism of the movie, which I enjoyed very much. But because the story it told is so interesting, it left me wanting to know so much more."
Descendant,Just a bit dull really,"I've never heard of this - I've got no real expectations, but it doesn't exactly sound like a giggle.

It tells the story of the Clotilda/Clotilde (the spelling seems uncertain), a slave ship organised for a bet by a white landowner after slavery had been abolished. This brought 110 Africans to Alabama - and was then burned and sunk leaving no evidence it ever existed, except for a load of people who'd been threatened with lynching if they ever spoke about it. But they told their children, and their children's children, and - well, you get the idea! And now their 6x great-grandchildren are telling us their stories.

Unfortunately, because the ship was burned and sank, there's absolutely no physical evidence that any of this happened - so part of the film focusses on efforts to find the wreck, but when you look at a map of the Mobile river you can't help but feel their chances are somewhat limited (no spoilers as to whether they found it though!). And they also interview quite a few people that have no interest in finding it - as one lady puts it ""how do I put this? I just don't care"". But might she change her mind?

The film also considers other elements of the history of the community - it makes an interesting point that a lot of the surrounding land is used for heavy industry which has resulted in various health issues - and the land is owned by the descendants of the landowner that originally brought the slaves over, so history (once again) shows its nasty habit of repeating itself. And then talk turns to reparations...

What are reparations supposed to provide? Justice? Punishment? Closure? Whilst crimes can't be inherited by descendant, assets and hardship certainly can, so what value should be placed on them? If reparations are made, who do they go to? And given that the landowner's descendants have absolutely no interest in engaging in any dialogue, how could they even be possible?

The film certainly poses some interesting questions although it probably won't surprise you hear that it doesn't answer them - that's probably asking a bit too much from a 109 minute Netflix documentary. The film does manage to end on a positive note though - various people have hope for the future, whatever it might hold.

However, I also have to report that the interesting questions don't fill up a huge amount of those 109 minutes either - it's all very worthy, but unfortunately it's not exactly thrilling. It's most a lot of people just talking about stuff that means something to them but not a lot to anyone else or reading from a book. There's also a lot of repeated use of the same historical footage - it feels unfortunately like filler.

I feel a bit mean being nasty about what it obviously an important film for a lot of people - I know it never hurts for me to be educated in this stuff, but I'm afraid that just didn't really do it for me. It's diverting in places with some nice countryside (balanced by some very ugly urban scenes), but it's no more than that, I'm afraid. If, after that glowing recommendation, you still fancy watching it then it's on Netflix but there's much more interesting stuff on there."
Descendant,The most verified/truthful movie in the Hollywood for history lovers,"Hollywood fan of history and true events movies. This is for you dear. It elaborates the most tragic event in the history of United States of America, despite of being war with the Latin Americans (Red Indians) there is also a painful history of black Africans who were brought from Africa forcefully into the strange lands of America and become the slaves of white people. Most of them were also killed and separated from their families and even the children of africans faced these traumatic events at that time. After that a long struggle was started which gives them a little bit freedom but there are still lives who are waiting for justice."
Descendant,Thee best,Comentario no disponible
Descendant,something's down there,"Slavery was one of the most important, and most disgraceful, parts of US history. Most of the focus on it emphasizes the plantations, the whipping of the enslaved African-Americans, and the Underground Railroad. A lesser known part is the slave trade itself. Outlawed in 1808, it continued in secret. The last ship to bring kidnapped Africans to the United States was the Clotilda, which docked in Mobile, Alabama, before getting sunk to hide its violation of the ban on slave-trading.

Margaret Brown's ""Descendant"" focuses on this, as well as the descendants of the enslaved people on the Alabama coast. It's a fascinating look at the aftermath of slavery, and how the descendants of the slaveowners are the biggest landholders in the area. Not to mention the chemical refineries dumping all sorts of toxins.

This is not a documentary that you'll forget anytime soon. I recommend it."
Descendant,Gold Coast Slaveship Bootlegger Style,Comentario no disponible
Descendant,absolute garbage,Interviewing a bunch of relatives of slaves who just want reparation's for something their great great great grandparents went through. People they never met nor spoke to. Sad that the memory of the people who went through slavery has been reduced to this. The slaves remained strong through humility. They had Christ in their lives and God delivered a people who put their faith in Him. To try to capitalize on a situation like this by making a documentary based on the telephone game mentality of people who honestly are so far removed from the situation any testimony given will be self centric in nature is appalling. Should you ask Caucasian Americans with Italian decent about the roman empire? I think not.

Welcome to Waikiki,Endless Fun for a Light Hearted Hour,"Imagine a cross of Friends, Three Men and a Baby, American Pie and Airplane, that somehow manages to maintain continuity and have heart. It sounds hard to believe but you have to watch to see."
Welcome to Waikiki,Good Enough,"Eulachacha Waikiki (odd title) isn't one of your typical k dramas. It is a comedy that is followed by romance. The funny parts are plenty and they continue till the very last episode. Actually, the comedy part is quite solide, without overtrying it or making seriously silly jokes. Then there is the romance. The love stories were okay, but they were not the main focus of the drama, rightfully at least, as they weren't that great. In addition, the performances were nice and they helped with the comedy part of the drama. Finally, the 20 episode length weren't tiring and it helped with the development of the story. So, 8 out of 10."
Welcome to Waikiki,The funniest kdrama,This is one my fav Korean TV shows.. And the funniest .. The characters are so silly.. I love it
Welcome to Waikiki,Absolutely phenomenal,"Every single thing about this show was on point, from the storytelling, acting, to the plot and script. Each episode made me laugh my heart out without feeling that it was trying too hard to be funny. I'm not a huge fan of k-dramas, but this one exceeded my expectations in every way. A must watch!"
Welcome to Waikiki,Funniest K-drama series I've ever watched!,"There wasn't one episode I didn't laugh.This drama includes scenarios we typically see in any comedy-based movie or series but this one exceeded my expectations. I wish they would do more movies and series like this. The best! If you want to laugh from the first to the last episode, watch this."
Welcome to Waikiki,Every scene is better than the one before,"You will never be bored if you give this show a try. Definitely the best korean drama I have seen. The funny parts are very cringe-worthy but incredibly funny, never thought I'd be laughing at scenes like that. I didn't like the first episode the first time I tried watching it, so gave it a second try and I'm happy I did, one of the few shows that I don't mind rewatching because everyone is beautiful and funny in their own way."
Welcome to Waikiki,Enjoyed every bit of it,I don't leave reviews but this is one of the best dramas I've seen. I have never laughed so much. Must watch 👍🏻

Welcome to Waikiki,Made us laugh so much,Every episode is funny! Lol I definitely will rewatch this show.
Welcome to Waikiki,The plot is very relaxed and happy,"The plot is very relaxed and happy, the jokes are enough, and the characters have distinct personalities. The disadvantage is that the emotional transformation is slightly rigid, the proportion of love plays is too much, and the same stalks are used back and forth."
Welcome to Waikiki,A must watch pure comedy drama,It's a pleasure to have series like this.. so much enjoyable with family & friends. The actors & co stars did Thier perfect class of acting. So it's a 10 out of 10 from me
Welcome to Waikiki,Not funny,"Slapstick comedy and not funny. There is no chemistry between the love teams. The female lead looks like tired and havent eaten for a while, acting was the worst among the characters. The story plot for each was not interesting. I gave 5 for the baby, the settings, the soundtrack and the 2nd male lead.I added two more stars from original 3 stars because the second season was better."
Welcome to Waikiki,full of jokes,"Actually this drama made me fall in love with Korean dramas. This drama is full of jokes. I like their friendship, even though they are always fighting. in the end they became close friends again. you have to watch this bro"
Welcome to Waikiki,Absolutely amazing and entertaining,"That "".GWENCHANA"" is probably the best dialogue in entire Korean series. Absolutely loved it"
Welcome to Waikiki,A must watch for kdrama lovers,"By far the best comedy kdrama I've seen. No dull moments. Every one's acting is on point. Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to end. So, 10 on 10 for me."

Welcome to Waikiki,Extremely hilarious,I laughed like crazy. There is no cringey cliche romance! The jokes and plot was so situational comedy. There were some moments i laughed so loud that my Landlord came down and asked me if everything's okay.
Welcome to Waikiki,"ABOUT AS HAWAIIAN AS, WELL, KOREA, BUT WELL WORTH A VISIT","If you're looking for an indicator of popularity, then a second season is pretty safe. Which for some reason is actually not that common in K Drama ( who wouldn't want it for Secretary Kim ? ), but if the level of public enthusiasm and love for the characters leads to a second helping, chances are you'll probably like it. I haven't seen season two of Waikiki yet but I definitely will because this first one is really enjoyable. It's sweet, consistently funny, well-acted and generally very entertaining. The ""Waikiki"" is the name of a hostel run by three men ( they're also friends ) and a woman. Alpha male Dong Goo ( Kim Jung Hyun ) has ambitions to direct a movie and needs money. Struggling actor Joon Ki ( Lee Yi Kyung ) yearns for success and shy Doo Sik ( Son Seung Won ) is writing a cheesy B-movie script which Dong will direct. Seo Jin ( Go Won Hee ) is Dong's younger sister and desperate to find a decent job. Joining the main quartet in quick time is quiet single mum Yoon Ah ( Jung In Sun ) and her cute baby daughter, and the bossy Soo Ah ( Lee Joo Woo ); she's Dong's ex GF. Also worthy of mention is pastry chef Hun Joo ( Kang Kyung Jun ). He's suave, wealthy and handsome so veteran K Drama fans will know his outcome. Things get off to a rather predictable start : nobody has EVER seen a bunch of single guys grossed out by a baby's ""deposit"", while the sight of a young breast-feeding mother has to provoke frantic embarrassment in the same group. From then on, however, I'm pleased to say the laughs come thick and fast as do a few surprises. This type of sit-com format rises/falls primarily on the strength of the jokes, and a number of scenarios are especially amusing. Two of the boys volunteer for a paid medicine trial with interesting results; one of them acquires a stalker which is cleverly done; a master/student situation concerning a children's game reminded me of ""The Karate Kid""; an extremely defective car takes two of them prisoner; a gorgeous female foreigner visits the hostel to hilarious effect and one of the boys encounters a celebrity with VERY devoted fans. That one features some effective satire, while the toilet humour sprinkled throughout the show works very well too without going overboard; after all, what can be funnier than a pretty young woman who farts ? The answer : not much. Humour is important, though it won't count for much if we don't care about the characters. All the main cast are likable, and the various relationships which are formed along the way enhance the ""care-factor"". Quality writing is the key here, as are the right actors. KJH is initially hard to warm to, yet mellows quickly. LYK has a slight tendency to overdo the face-pulling at times but has plenty of charisma and energy. SSW is engaging and develops nicely. GWH handles a range of moods with aplomb; JIS starts quietly and really blossoms, and that also applies to the haughty and eventually comical LJW. The director should take a bow for keeping things moving briskly while also injecting some visual style on occasion ( eg Joon Ki and his talkative mentor ). So, the bar's been set pretty high for the sequel and most of the original cast are gone. Hmm. I'll be sure to take a deep, anxious breath before I visit Waikiki a second time."

Welcome to Waikiki,KDramas Second Best Attempt At Comedy (Season 1 only),"Season 1 The drama did a great job in blending humor and heart, creating an enjoyable mix with a lively dynamic, for the most part. The comedy was sharp and varied, ranging from slapstick to witty banter, however, this didn't apply for every segment and joke. Some of these went on for too long or weren't interesting in the slightest, these were also more present in the 2nd half than the first one. Nonetheless, not only the drama had great humor but also had a progressing story that fit right in. The dynamic chemistry among the cast enhanced the comedic timing, while the well-paced storyline balanced these moments with memorable scenes. Speaking of dynamics, Doo Shik remained a sidekick and a third wheel in every situation and scene, he was never a lead and always the weakest link, even the actor himself. The drama should've wrote him better to fit the dynamic rather than having a wasted slot. Anyway, it's an enjoyable fun watch for what it had to offer. However, I highly advise against watching season 2.

Season 2 In comparison, season 2 was a complete utter failure in all regards, however, as a stand alone drama, it was a passable cheap inoffensive forgettable watch, for the most part. It failed miserably to capture the same magic that made the first season so endearing. The second season felt like a pale imitation, struggling to find its footing. One major issue was the lack of continuity in the cast, with many beloved characters and dynamics from the first season absent with no worthy replacements. This shift disrupted the chemistry and dynamic that were crucial to the show's initial charm. The new characters, while sometimes amusing, didn't bring the same level of depth, humor and relatability, resulting in a series of forced and often flat comedic moments. Speaking of comedy, the writing in season 2 leaned heavily on repetitive gags and clichéd scenarios, lacking the creativity and originality that kept the first season fresh and engaging. Not to mention its poor job in recycling some of the gags and scenarios, as well as most of the romances and its archetypes from season 1. Seriously shameful! The brief storylines were disjointed, and the emotional moments that once balanced the humor now came across as contrived and artificial. The romantic relationships, while they never were the main focus, were really stupid and tasteless. The pacing also suffered, with episodes dragging without the slightest engaging interplay of humor and character moments that previously defined the show. Second season tried to replicate the success of its predecessor but fell quite short, the charm, wit, and warmth that made the first season a hit were noticeably missing. I highly advise watching S1 and ignoring S2. Season 2 gets 4/10."

Welcome to Waikiki,You think you won't laugh but..,"You do. A lot.

Situations are not even forced. They make sense. And funny. As hell.

If you want to laugh I mean just laugh, without having to worry about whether you will find next scene funny or impossible, watch this.

Season 2 is just as funny.

Don't worry about character development or story development. Just watch. And laugh."

The Cuphead Show!,A good show,"Absolutely amazing, i love the characters and everything in the show. I played the game in 2017 , and this show gives me butterflies somehow 😂 I recommend watching it guys, short show with 100% guarantee of enjoying it."
The Cuphead Show!,Way More Potential,I was so excited for the show. It had extremely high potential. The show has top-tier animation art style. That is the only thing that could keep me watching this show. It is geared completely for kids. Is most accurately a simple combination of SpongeBob and Mickey Mouse sadly. Not to say it is not original as it is very much so. They could have easily made something that still didn't have any mature content but was much more appealing and drawing in story to adult audience as well. There are some occasional notably clever and great dilague quicks and moments.
The Cuphead Show!,Decent albeit Routine Adaptation of a Heavily Inspired Game,"As of 2017, the run-and-gun game Cuphead has made quite the impact in animation, partially thanks to its tribute to the rubber hose era of American animation in the 1930s. Of course with its success comes a TV series spinoff, made for Netflix no less, along with the assistance of game creators Chad and Jared Moldenhaeur from Studio MDHR. With an announced 36 episode lineup and only 1/3 of those episodes haven released, the show has garnered fairly positive reviews, albeit with some criticism from snobbish animation enthusiasts. But as for how it works on its own, how is the show handling itself so far?

The Cuphead Show, at least as of this first season, follows the impulsive Cuphead and his cautious brother Mugman on random misadventures, including several that spawned from Cuphead owing the Devil his soul. As a fairly episodic series, the show spends a fair amount of time focusing on whatever shenanigans Cuphead and Mugman get themselves into. While sometimes feeling like filler in light of the first episode where the devil is introduced, the series does keep its main narrative intact in regards to how much trouble the devil truly is to the souls on the Inkwell Isle, if not the whole world. As for the other plots, they tend to feel standard to older cartoon tropes and TV episode formats such as a troublesome baby to a ferry boat club filled with ice cream to the cup's Elder Kettle caretaker mistaking them for believing him to be too old for his own good. Admittedly, the show is usually at its best when Cuphead and Mugman have to face the villainous Devil creeping up on them. By contrast, the brothers are fairly one note and don't offer much from your average cartoon protagonists in modern kids shows.

As for other notable aspects, the animation is well done for what the show is aiming to mimic: in this case, 1930s rubber hose cartoons. While there's a lot of rigging going on in the character movements, the work still pays off with fun motion and lavish poses, especially with the blend of stereoscopic stop-motion sets from Screen Novelties and overly colorful effects work. At times the recreation of older animation feels fairly unneeded, like the grain and old timey music, although that could be expected from paying homage by default. Perhaps most obvious with the creative animation comes from the cast, including Tru Valentino as Cuphead, Frank Todaro as Mugman, Joe Hanna as Elder Kettle, Luke Millington-Drake as the Devil and many more veteran comedians and VAs. Given the material on screen, a lot of enthusiasm is needed from the ensemble cast, and they delivered with hysterical spontaneity, even if there may be a bit too many Bronx accents here and there. Admittedly, newcomers could find more appeal in the artwork than the stories.

So while The Cuphead Show sort of has its trouble of finding its own identity in terms of narrative and character, the artwork on display, voice acting and help from its inspirations gives it just enough entertainment value for further viewings. With at least one more season expected sometime later on, there's definitely room for improvement and more down the road than meets the eye initially. I would say this is worth viewing for the time being, especially if you're a die hard fan of the original game (as overwhelming as it is). There can only be so much to expect in the future, so hold on tight for more to come."
The Cuphead Show!,"A faithful expansion on the popular game and mostly faithful homage to the 30s ""rubber hose"" animations of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer","Set in the surreal and fantastical world of the Inkwell Isles, the series follows the misadventure of two young anthropomorphic cups, the brash and impulsive Cuphead (Tru Valentino) his brother the cautious and timid but comparatively more level headed Mugman (Frank Todaro). The two cups often cause headaches for their caretaken Elder Kettle (Joe Hanna) and are often involved in run-ins with The Devil (Luke Millington-Drake) after Cuphead unwittingly ended up owing is soul to him and rand from the debt.

The Cuphead Show! Is an adaptation of the video game Cuphead by Studio MDHR. The game received praise not only for it's engaging ""Bullet Hell"" style gameplay, but also its impressive animation which utilized many of the animation techniques of its stylistic influences. With creative influence from Studio MDHR and featuring some impressive animation techniques that mostly successfully mirror both the game and its Golden Age animation influences, The Cuphead Show! Is an enjoyable ride through surreal comic nonsense.

The animation looks fantastic. While the show didn't use the exact same technique due to time constraints, the show still maintains the same aesthetic appeal seen in the games with some great inclusion of stop-motion animation for certain sequences interacting seamlessly with the 2D figures. The environments of the Inkwell Isles are loving crafted with familiar locales from the games showcased and expanded upon for Cuphead and Mugman's misadventures. Some scenes sometimes do break the illusion of immersion such as a party scene in the episode Root Packed where some of the party goers look static and/or floaty on the physical backdrop, but the show's ambition makes up for flubs like that.

Cuphead and Mugman are fun characters with Cuphead's more carefree irresponsible attitude counterbalanced by the more cautious and unfortunately all too aware Mugman with their dynamic creating solid comic friction as the duo encounter. The show also gives expansion on the personalities of various bosses and side-characters from the games with boxing frog brothers RIbby and Croaks, Cuphead and Mugman's parental figure Elder Kettle, the trio of freeloading vegetables The Root Pack, and hands down the best character The Devil whose portrayal by Luke Millington-Drake gives a dry affected vaguely British sounding delivery to the character whose explosive rage and frusturation at not getting Cuphead's soul reminded me of David Warner's performance in cult show Freakazoid! As The Lobe who exhibited many of the same traits.

Uncommon for this era of streaming, there's not really a ""running narrative"" compelling viewers to binge the series with each episode about 10 minutes long and being relatively self-contained. Aside from the first episode setting up Cuphead owing his soul to The Devil, it's not a primary focus and is more used as an excuse to create comic friction with a recurring antagonist and still allows the cartoons to function as self-contained comic set pieces. The show also features some really good music and songs, done by Ego Plum, throughout the series with a particular standout piece being the episode ""Ghosts Ain't Real"" with some really fun and even a little macabre that harkens back to horror themed animation shorts like Swing You Sinners or The Lonesome Ghosts. The show does ""season bait"" in its final episode which sees the introduction of new character Ms. Chalice, and for the most part the character's introduction is really well done with the character feeling very reminiscent in both personality and design like Betty Boop or Steamboat Willie's take on Minnie Mouse if you filtered the character with a little bit of intensity seen with Dot from Animaniacs. I wasn't terribly bothered by the ending, but given how it ends it probably could've still ended the same way and still been self-contained.

The Cuphead Show! Is a mostly faithful expansion on the world and characters of the Cuphead game and gives us some solid visually interesting misadventures that capture the surreal strangeness of the ""rubber hose"" animations of the 30s. With plenty of charm coming from the voice cast as well as the animation the show constantly keeps you engaged with its efficiently and effectively delivered surreal nonsense."
The Cuphead Show!,Great Cartoon Based On A Video Game,"Cuphead is a celebrated video game, praised for being hand-drawn while said to be hard as nails. The game is so popular, we get a cartoon on Netflix called The Cuphead Show.

Basically, like the game it's based on, The Cuphead Show invokes the element of the golden age of cartoons, as after the amazing theme song, each episode opens with its own title card (designed like the old time Looney Tunes and Walt Disney ones), and the animation is basically as vintage-looking as those while still being digitally animated, as each episode shows Cuphead and his brother, Mugman, getting into various misadventures on the Inkwell Isles. Cuphead is the impatient star who decides to do stuff leading to such misadventures, despite the objections of the wise and understanding Mugman, who at the end, decides to go with it anyways, usually leading the two to danger, with villains like The Devil, boxing frogs Ribby and Croak, and King Dice, while meeting new friends like Miss Chalice.

This is actually a good cartoon. The voice acting is good, the humor is on par with the classics the game it's based on takes inspiration for. If there are a couple of things I don't like, it's the fact the final episode basically ends the season on a cliffhanger (which is basically annoying) and some of the episodes I do not like the plot of."
The Cuphead Show!,Expected more,"After playing the game, watching lots of gameplay videos and buying the art book, I was very excited when The Cuphead Show was announced.

However, I think my expectations were a bit too high... The script isn't great. I think if it was less aimed at children, it would've been an improvement.

On the bright side, the art does not disappoint!

It's great to see all the characters from the video game on the show.

I definitely recommend giving it a try though!"
The Cuphead Show!,A Cup Full Of Comedy 😀,"Cuphead took the world by storm back in 2017 with it's throwback aesthetic, challenging but fun game play and slapping soundtrack. Save for the game play, The Cuphead Show maintains the main 2 core aspects of the game as will as adding in some talented voice acting, fleshing out the characters and providing lots of laughs throughout each episode. From the superb writing to the amazing comedy, The Cuphead Show made the constants delays and production hurdles worth it.

Developed by Dave Wasson (creator of Cartoon Network's Time Squad) with the original creators of Cuphead, Chad and Jared Moldenhauer, serving as executive producers, The Cuphead Show follows the adventures of Cuphead and his brother Mugman on Inkwell Isle. While the recurring arc of the show is the Devil wanting Cuphead's soul, the show's primary focus is being an episodic comedy like the 1930s cartoons that inspired the game. Each episode features Cuphead and Mugman going on an adventure on Inkwell Isle and hilarious shenanigans ensue. With a runtime of 14-16 minutes, each episode wastes no time before getting the viewer on the brother's side and laughing with/at them and their antics. While we're rooting for them to make it out alive, we're also laughing at hilarious comedy that ranges from clever word play, funny visual gags and hysterical slapstick. Some of the funniest moments come from the antagonists getting their comeuppances in hilarious fashion or the brothers outwitting the Devil himself. In addition to really strong comedy, the show also goes the extra mile of fleshing out the characters and the world they inhabit. From showing the brothers's relationship with their Elder Kettle, how the Devil runs his operations to even how the brothers meet antagonists from the game. There are also musical numbers in every other episode that serve the story in upbeat and organic ways. The show does a really good job building the world of Inkwell Isle by providing really hilarious comedy and keeping the storytelling focused on the brothers.

The characters from the game were given much more personality this time around as before they only had basic personalities at best to serves the narrative of the game. Starting with our titular hero, Cuphead is a mischievous, playful and clever character who still very much cares about his brother and Elder Kettle and he's also sympathetic enough so that we relate to him. Mugman is more cautious than his brother, but he still likes to have fun and is still willing to help his brother out. They but heads from time to time, but they still love and respect each other at the end of the day. Their parental guardian, the Elder Kettle, is a fun and lively old man who tries his best to raise his boys right. He's more than willing to put his foot down when they misbehave and helps them out whenever he can. Then there's the Devil himself, the ruthless ruler of Inkwell Isle. There have been many different depictions of the Devil, but this show has one of the funniest deceptions I've seen of the fallen angel. He's charismatic, he's temperamental, he has multiple evil transformations and he relishes in being a dastardly demon. Every time he's outwitted by the brothers it gets a really good laugh out of me, particularly when he gets shocked by the invisible sweater. Other notable standout characters include Porkrind, the owner of a shop who detests the brothers, Ribby and Croaks, a couple of bickering frog brothers who own a club, King Dice, the host of a game show that's actually a scam, and Ms. Chalice, who's a street smart girl who uses her charm to get what she wants.

Bringing these characters to life are the wonderful voice talents directed by the wonderful Sara Jane Sherman. Tru Valentino and Frank Todaro give Cuphead and Mugman distinct Jersey accents with Tru making Cuphead sound more confident while Frank makes Mugman sound really cautious. Joe Hanna did a fantastic job voicing the Elder Kettle, making him sound like a middle aged man who has to deal with 2 young boys. Luke Milington-Drake was the MVP for me as the Devil as he made him sound so flamboyant yet very short tempered. He also did a fantastic job with his musical number. Wayne Brady did such a good job voicing King Dice making him sound so charismatic yet perfectly captures his nervousness when speaking to the Devil. Grey Griffin truly shines as Ms. Chalice, really nailing that Jersey accent and making her sound so spunky. Chris Wylde and Rick Zieff had such believable chemistry as Ribby and Croaks and made them sound just like real tough guys trying (and hilariously failing) to pretend to be nice guys. Other voice talents such as Jim Conroy, Keith Ferguson, Candi Milo and Cosmo Segurson did a really good job bringing the other inhabitants of Inkwell Isle to life.

Visually, the show looks absolutely phenomenal just like the game it's based on. The character designs retain their rubber hose look to them while also appearing more polished for a more streamlined production than that of the game. Lighthouse Studios and Screen Novelties provided the animation and it's as bouncy and lively as the 1930s cartoons that inspired the game. Characters squash, stretch and bend like cartoon characters should, their facial expressions go off model for the right reasons and cartoonish gags such as seeing one's skeleton when shocked are used to great effect. The bright colors are giving just the right amount of contrast with the amount of black and darker hues, particularly at night. There's also some elements of real life 3D objects for the backgrounds that make this feeling like a trip to the past. My personal favorite moment of animation in the show is when Cuphead and Mugman are trying to escape the graveyard from the episode Ghosts Ain't Real. From the amount of ghosts on screen to the nod to the Skeleton Dance short to the eerie atmosphere, this episode would make for the perfect Halloween special if it was longer and had Cuphead and Mugman out trick or treating. Like the game before it, they really went the extra mile to make the animation spectacular.

I'd be re-missing myself if I talked about The Cuphead Show without bringing up the music. Composed by Ego Plum, the music in this show perfectly captures the jazzy feel of the 1930s just like the game. There's heavy emphasis on brass and strings, particularly the saxophone and bass, it's chaotic in rhythm yet so satisfying and the music cues were very on point. They even due call backs to music of the games such as the themes for the Root Pack and Ribby and Croaks being used in their respective episodes. There's also the theme song which is sung wonderfully by Gizzelle Andrea Becerra. It's just full of energy, Gizzelle has such great vocal range and the visuals complement it beautifully. I especially love it when Cuphead and Mugman join in and sing along while also ending the song on a really funny note (literally as Mugman plays the trombone before falling face first). The credits play a chipper piano tune which is just the perfect way to bookend each episode. The music is arguably the most important ingredient in this show; if it wasn't as good as it was, I guarantee you the rest of the show would suffer for it.

Like the game it's based on, The Cuphead Show is a fantastic throwback to 1930s animation yet it feels so fresh and outstanding in execution. From the outstanding animation, the hilarious humor, well defined characters, stellar voice acting and really catchy music, this currently sits along side Kid Cosmic and Hilda as one of my personal favorite animated shows on Netflix. My only critique of this otherwise amazing show is that the first season ends rather abruptly. I really hope Season 2 comes out soon so until then give The Cuphead Show a watch. If this show is not for you, play the game. Either way, let Chad and Jared Moldenhauer know that all their hard work on their passion project was not in vain by supporting it."
The Cuphead Show!,ok,"While it does have it's charm. And a nice touch with some homages. Most of the series is pretty standard as far as normaal episodic cartoons go. Not bad in any way or form, and there are 2 or 3 good episodes. But overall, it wasn't all that special. All in all, charming with its animations, but overall pretty normal.

6/10: sure."
The Cuphead Show!,Welcome to the show!,"The episodes are short and sweet, lasting around 12 minutes each, not counting the credits. It tells a stand alone story for each episode, following the two brothers and their mischievous, wacky and insane adventures, bringing in familiar faces from the original video game. It uses the effects, sounds and music from the game, while adding new tracks into the mix. They build on the characters, whom didn't even have a much of a voice cast in the game, but they do know, and it works wonderfully. The actors do an amazing job at capturing the essence and childishness of the two cups, while the devil and dice sound just as you would have imagined.

It brings over the classic cartoon art style from the game, while middling with modern humor and timing. Cuphead and Mugman have great banter, bringing with it some pretty funny and memorable moments, making you want to keep watching at the end of each episode. The animation is of course one of its greatest selling points, and it's a feat for the eyes. Looking like the game, something out of the animation from the 1930's, just modernized, paying homage to manny of the wacky set pieces and traits of that era of animation. Even if you haven't played the game, fell of it or know nothing about Cuphead, you will easily be able to follow the story and have a fun and light hearted time.

The show does a great job at taking the groundwork from the game and bringing the characters to life. Telling funny and charming short stories, about a cup, a mug and friends, which works wonderfully as yet another addition to Netflix's growing catalogue of video game adaptations!

8/10."
The Cuphead Show!,"For the younger set, but I enjoyed it",This show has throwback animation to the 1930s but the jokes have a more contemporary feel. My favorite episodes were 5 (with King Dice) and 12 (Grey Griffin is perfection as Ms. Chalice). My favorite character is the Devil.
The Cuphead Show!,A Great 30's Animation Tribute,"The Cuphead Show is a welcoming love letter to the rubber-hosed retro style of animation from the golden age era. It's fun, it's wacky, old school like, the characters personalities and voices are interesting, and beautifully animated. The stories are fun and adventurous which I like, but the plot could probably do better in the later seasons. I'm hope they would pay more respect to the original cult-hit run and gun video game. So far, that type of element is missing. Minor flaw, but the show is still worthy to fun even for the fans of the game, and fans of the old-school animation since it's glory begin in the 1930's."
The Cuphead Show!,It's enjoyable and fun,"The most inmpresive thing about this show is the animation of course and at all time it will be pleasant to watch at any moment. The series is also presented in a short format, episodes having only like 10 minutes runtime and honestly it works better that way because at somepoint I just wanted some of the episodes to end. It was fun, the songs were good, and all, But it didn't click with me. I was actually thinking in what else I could watch but I do recognize it's strenghts. So you can have a little fun watching them but at the end it's nothing really special besides the animation."
The Cuphead Show!,"Keep the Animators, Lose the writers.","SOOOooo... Boring. If you wanna support this team by forcing yourself to watch, then enjoy the intro song(mwah! Chef's kiss) and episode 1, then skip to episode 5. Music, back-grounds and animation is the TOP TEIR, but this isn't a silent cartoon. Unfortunately there is dialog and it's ""pee-yew""! All the writing is severely lacking. This isn't Ren and Stimpy, Tom and Jerry, or Bugs and Daffy. Noise and wild takes are not enough to keep your children's attention for even a single episode. If they can't pick things up for season 2 it's going to be such a waste of an Intellectual Property."
The Cuphead Show!,Freaking Entertaining,Provides excitement throughout an episode and has a classic vintage style and vintage music which provides a major throwback to old school animations. It can only go up from now.
The Cuphead Show!,I for one love it!,"When I first heard that there was a Cuphead show in the making I actually wasn't very excited. I had played the game and loved it, but I just wasn't sure if it would work as a cartoon series. I watched the whole first season on Netflix, and oh boy was I wrong! Not only did I find The Cuphead Show to be way better than I expected, but I actually outright love it and would definetly consider it the best cartoon of the decade so far. The artwork in this show is lovely, the shows atmosphere is full of life, the episode plots are interesting, the characters are all a joy and they act exactly as I expected them to, and there are plenty of good jokes. I am so glad they decided to make Cuphead into a show, and I can't til season 2 and 3 come out on Netflix."
The Cuphead Show!,Half great Half meh,"The devil is the best character and every episode with him in is great, but the rest of the show is nothing special and the characters are very One note."
The Cuphead Show!,"Trying to be Spongebob, but based on a game","Weird casting, but I'm not surprised, because this is Netflix. I've never played Cuphead, but as far as I'm aware, the animation and music are spot-on, very fluid, rubbery movements like in early cartoons, with orchestral music that follows the events on-screen. Good stuff.

It feels even more for-small-children than Spongebob is, though, and that's weird, considering who the game was aimed at. It's a bit of a wrong move to aim this show at that young of an audience, but again, this is Netflix making the big choices after all, and as usual, they're wrong.

I'm rating higher than I should because someone worked hard on those visuals and music. The writers also probably did their best with what they're allowed.

But yeah, not exactly riveting content, just Cuphead-y enough to make the fans watch it, I'm sure, and that'll be enough of a reason for this show to become popular."
The Cuphead Show!,Awesome,Absolutely amazing animation and really gives you a nostalgic old cartoon vibe. The voice acting is tremendous and the story is fun. If you are a fan of the video game or of old style cartoons than you will love cuphead. We definitely need more cartoons with older style animation!
The Cuphead Show!,Much better than expected,"The game already presented superb olschool characters and music. On top of that, animators adopted early Nickelodeon style animations that remind me Ren & Stimpy Show. However, I'm not sure about the sound quality. Maybe it could have been a bit lower quality as in the game, this polished version is not a great fit.

As for the stories, well they're not that enjoyable. In my opinion episodes are way too harmless, always stays in the safe side. Basically not so interesting stories of two spoiled kids. This could have been easily the next Sponge Bob, clearly writers couldn't manage to do it. I don't know what's the targeted age here yet it's easy to say it is not for adults (or even teenagers). Also each episode is around 12 minutes, which is too short. It should have been at least 15 minutes.

Regardless, I've had zero expectations since game didn't have a story to carry. Therefore I can call this a mild success. I hope that writers will come up with better stories and sense of humor for possible next season and utilize the full potential of these cool characters and animation style."
The Cuphead Show!,"FANTASTIC! Not perfect, but fantastic.","The Cuphead didn't dissapoint me at all, it's a fun show for people who are fan of Cuphead, the art direction is awesome (even if it's not the original one).

Sure it has some flaws, like sometimes I felt cringe watching it (Especially episode 2) but overral it's a great experience I reccomend to watch."
The Cuphead Show!,Technically it's good but,"I loved the game and played it a lot, alone or with friends, so this was awesome to hear about the Series on Netflix.

From a technical perspective this show is really well made, but story wise it messes up with pretty everything from the original.

This is leading me to rate it with just 6 out of 10 Stars. I was hoping to see some nice ideas given by the great template the game was, but instead this feels more like just another sell out of successfull brands.

Of course it's hard to recreate a story, especially if it's something that has a big fan base with big expectations, but then you either have to do it right or you'll have to be creative enough to tell you own storys within the universe. It's not that the Videogame has so much story, you could easily have packed everything in 15 minute episodes and there would be still enough time to fill it with own ideas.

There is one thing I have to criticise, the small reverences the show has made weren't even as good as what I was expecting them to be, there is Fan Art, that is way better than this Netflix Production. But maybe this all comes from my high expectations as a Fan of the original.

Just said, it's a good show, people who like the style and don't know the game will probably have a really good thime with this, but speaking for fans I think it's fair to say, that they left a lot of the potential in their ink feather."
The Cuphead Show!,AWESOME!!!!,"Better than expected!! We adooore it!! Please never cancel the show, we need more than 3 seasons!! There are still lots of bosses from the game left!

Cuphead is the most unique most creative and most nostalgic phenomenon that could ever be made! Both for the game and the show!🔥🔥💖 It's the best cartoon for any age! Nothing cringy, nothing out of place or inappropriate! It's simply the best and I hope they keep being faithful to the main plot and it doesn't get ruined as spongebob did!

My nephew and I love this show, it was so inspirational for us. It means more than just a show to us. I'm glad it exists! I'd definitely give it a 10/10!!!

Thank you all for keeping this masterpiece going💪🏻 🙏🏻🌹🌹🌿☕☕🎲🎲"
The Cuphead Show!,Really good,"It works even if you don't know the videogame. I don't like the fact that the cupheads were kind of dumb, but they had their ""smart"" moments so it's ok. The soundtrack was good and I really love the animation."
The Cuphead Show!,Its meh,"I really like the video game to cuphead but I don't understand these high ratings 9s and 10s the plot is really boring and most of episodes full of fillers I know original game has simple plot but its fun and interesting full of adventure I didn't get that from the show they changed up the fact he lost his soul at the carnival not at the casino and there's hardly any of bosses from orginal game.

The best part is the devil and King dice the animation is spot on and voice acting but plot is major disappointment im not hyped for next season.

My verdict

4/10."
The Cuphead Show!,A good video game show,"Probably one of the best video game adaptations in awhile. It stays trueful to the source material, and it's animations are great It's a great show as long as you don't mind the casual body horror and existential questions."
AlRawabi School for Girls,,
New Girl,Standards dropped,"Loved this show. Laugh out loud funny for a number of series and then at the end of s5 to the start of s6 it started to become a lot more cliche and lot less funny. I persevered and I'm glad I did just to see it through but it is almost like Liz Merriweather realised at the end of s6 that the show was just treading water with no real purpose so they bashed out s7 to put it all to bed. It comes off rushed and again a shade cliche. I just wished they had progressed the main themes a bit quicker or at least consistently to avoid this stagnation then rush rush rush end. Would still recommend it, some of the most loveable/hilarious characters and I did on occasion lose a manly tear. Also I much preferred the original titles."
New Girl,Surprisingly Solid,"Watched during pandemic lockdown, and have to give credit where it's due! Didnt anticipate it to be so good. And though I wanted to binge this, I watched over a few weeks and it really was awesome. Bummed I dont have any more to watch! Probably going to join the select few I have in rotation for rewatching. Give it a shot"
New Girl,My comfort show,"I can't give this show enough love. It's GENIUS! The chemistry between characters is amazing! And the character development is outstanding. In the beginning we get a more serious Winston, but as the show progresses, we see a more goofy Winston, which works. The writers really took their time to improve on each character. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because of how annoying Jess gets after Season 3. I'm not sure if it was purposefully done, but some of the episodes of her acting entitled and ""catty"" are hard to watch. Other than that, it's the perfect show. Perfect blend of comedy and drama. I just finished watching it all the way through for my 3rd time and immediately started watching for a 4th time. It's my comfort show. I watch it at night before going to sleep and most nights fall asleep to it as background noise. Highly recommend, especially for those who were fans of How I Met Your Mother. I guarantee you will fall in love with it."
New Girl,This show deserves a better review and a lot of love!,"The 1 star review that shows up when I looked this up on IMDb is ridiculous! I watch quite a few shows (way too many) and this one genuinely gets a smile on my face without cheap tricks, fake laughter, annoying punchline tunes trying to convince me what just happened was funny.

The main characters in this show are already memorable in the pilot, they just have chemistry straight away. A lot of shows that I really love now didn't start off as well as 'New Girl' has for me.

The 'formula' feels fresh to me, I haven't seen this show before in another form and I absolutely love Zoey in this. Her personality in this show is exactly why I fall in love in real life. Just watched the third episode and I'll be sure to tune in next week!"
New Girl,3 times watched and counting,"This is the only TV show I never get tired of. I started watching it shortly after it ended, and I don't think I've gone more than a month without watching an episode since. The whole cast brings a warm camaraderie to the show and the situations placed within make twenty/thirty somethings relate incredibly to. They start it well, they end it well, and everything in between has its purpose. I cannot think of any changes I would make (except for the whole Schmidt/Cece/Elizabeth debacle...Schmidt really hit a low likeability at that point, but he regained it slowly thankfully). I don't think there can ever be another New Girl and I'm okay with that. I'll just keep rewatching until I learn True American."
New Girl,"Light, refreshing comedy","From the first episode, I found New Girl to be my favourite new series. The premise of the show, a girl living with 3 guys and hilarity ensues, is not the most original, nor the most realistic. But I find the characters to be intriguing, so that I keep wanting to return to see what happens next.

After a few episodes, the characters become more relatable than in the pilot. Jess is totally awkward, and it seems half the time her head is in the clouds, and half the time she's the most down to earth character. Her extroverted nature becomes more manageable as the series develops, so don't let it put you off initially.

Nick is a 30-something drop out that still lives with a student mindset. He comes up with some creative ways to not spend money. He's portrayed as not living up to his potential, yet his manner draws you in, kind of like a helpless puppy that you find adorable and pitiful at the same time.

Other reviews are fairly down on Schmidt. Yes, initially, he reeks of douche bag. But he's an ex-fat-kid that now overcompensates for his lack of self esteem with douchey mannerisms. Given that, he's a fairly realistic character with a well developed history. His arrogance is always portrayed in a humorous way, and has become my favourite part of the show.

Winston had his 15 minutes of fame and now is dealing with just being a nobody in a big city again. Fair enough, token black guy.

There is a lot of awkward humour in this show - the kind of moments that make you cringe, yet you can't look away, and feel guilty about wanting to laugh. But every episode does make me laugh out loud. There's a touch of light drama, for those that just want a light hearted show that won't make you think too much.

Overall, I think this is a show about nothing. Every episode seems to be a bunch of intertwining events that happen, like in most sitcoms, but this reminds me most of Seinfeld (the ultimate show about nothing), in that there is no ultimate destination that the storyline needs to arrive at - no huge expectations or conclusions being hung on the season finale. It's just humorous interactions, some fairly plain and everyday events, and some totally wacky events. Just a bright, light hearted show, to be enjoyed for what it is."
New Girl,Surprisingly Great,"Contrary to my expectations, this is not the Zooey Deschanel show. Because that is what I thought it would be when my friend told me about it. I mean, the premise of this show is that she - Zooey Deschanel - plays a bubbly, quirky-but-cute girl who moves into an all-guys apartment. Now, that's the same character she plays in every film and every series she's ever been in. It's also the same persona she uses when she sings in her band, or gives interviews, or (I imagine) blogs about baking Dr. Seuss-themed cupcakes for a company of lumberjacks.

Don't get me wrong - it works. For me. On so many levels. But the problem is that she is just so aware of it. She's a dazzling indie girl with a brain and a body, and my god does she know it. So a show completely focusing on that would be unbearable.

But surprisingly, this show isn't about that at all. It isn't even really about her character that much. Most of the comedy comes from the male characters, who are played by non-famous and extremely talented actors, and who find themselves in situations which as funny as they are fresh and relatable.

So, to reiterate, this is not a show about Zooey Deschanel. This is a show about life as a twenty-something in the twenty-first century. It's Friends except not set or made in the nineties. It's great and it makes me laugh a lot. And I highly recommend it."
New Girl,Genuine Comedy from a US TV Show,"New Girl is received a whole lot better than a lot of other US TV shows due to the lack of a laugh track. You're not directed as to when you should find something funny, it is just an easy watch to enjoy throughout. The quality fluctuates across the series but overall it ticks all the boxes for a sitcom, and Winston will easily become your favourite character by the end."
New Girl,"Funny, intelligent, amazing.","New Girl is the type of series that you won't want to stop watching. IT will certainly put you in a good mood and you'll find yourself laughing while watching it.

The characters are incredibly well-written, each one of them having a back story that is easy to keep up with and very believable. It doesn't take long for us to feel like we're also living in this apartment where Jess moves in after being cheated on by her boyfriend. Soon enough, you'll be feeling like these characters are your friends too and you know them well. Each one of them has their particularities; they all have different personalities and obsessions that make them unique and set them apart from each other.

The fact that there's some plot development throughout the series makes it an interesting show to actually follow and not just watch once in a while. We also see some character development, changes in the characters' personalities that make us either proud or disappointed.

Truth is, there's no chance this show won't leave a mark on you. It's funny, but still intelligent. It's not some dumb show that simply aims at making the viewer laugh. The jokes are not corny and the events are not random. This is one comedy show like no other: The characters are not stereotyped, and the storyline is not typical and easily foreseeable.

Give this show a chance. You won't regret it."
New Girl,Probably one of the funniest series,"I think it is a very good show. It's been a while since I laughed that hard. I'd like to address a lot of the other reviews saying that it is not funny and unrealistic.

I feel that people rating this show badly have just been formatted by all the other series and movies. They are expecting a deep story and realism... I think they may have been mislead by Zooey Deschanel thinking it was going to be a lot more mature. It doesn't differ much from the big bang theory or How I Met your Mother in term of style. If anything it is better. But I don't see how you can not appreciate these characters. Saying they are unrealistic is like saying the ocean is full of water... It's a comedy TV show, not real life. So it's not a valid point in my opinion.

You should take it for what it is. They are very caricatured characters but it doesn't stop you from getting attached to their unique personality. I hope people don't get discouraged from giving it a chance because of the low reviews."
New Girl,I want a spin-off without Jess,"Yes she's the main character but she's just annoying. A spin-off set before Jess arrives starring Nick, Winston, Schmidt and Coach would be the bomb."
New Girl,what the..??,"what is going on in the heads of the people writing such bad reviews of this lovely little show?

I have to say as many of the others, this show is like a breath of fresh air, there are some great comedies out there these days like Modern family and HIMYM, but this one is a bit different.. it's sweet and endearing, a bit like Friends. And I'm laughing my ass of over every episode. Zooey does a great job here like usually, and I like the rest of the cast as well. The first couple of episodes were a little slow to start but the show has really found it's footing now. I really recommend it!"
New Girl,Should have stopped at season 5,"The show was very funny and enjoyable, but beginning season 6 Jessica starts to get annoying and nick gets dumber. Some episodes you could completely cut and the show would still make sense. I felt it became cliche and at sometimes cringe worthy."
New Girl,With Jess 4/10 Without Jesss 8/10,"That's how much her character ruining the show.

Apart from season 2 which is messed up at around mid season to the end of the season, every plotline and character is enjoyable if not gets a pass, but not Jess. She's the epitome of bad lead writing."
New Girl,Love the comedy,"Never gets old. Have seen it atleast 7-8 times, still love the humor and cuteness of the characters!! Especially the fun friendship between all of them. Makes me miss my college days. I cannot choose who I like more, all of them are perfect for the role they pay!! The dialogues are perfectly delivered, especially as they grow older the friendship grows which I hope existed in my life lol I wish they had more fun shows like this. Thank you New Girl cast for making me smile and loving your stories in my gloomy times!

I do wish they showed more of coach though that's my only ittty bitty complain!!! Cheers."
New Girl,Complete and utter goofballs together in an apartment are somehow quite heartwarming and funny.,"Season One: 8/10

Season Seven: 8/10

Themes: Comedy, Roommates, Friendship & Relationships.

Review: You simply cannot go wrong with a sitcom about a group of friends, and this one hit the nail on the head. I loved seeing these goofballs form friendships and relationships with each other, and I adored the dynamics between all the different personalities. Schmidt and Nick will always be the absolute funniest to me but in such completely opposite ways, Jess and all her quicks are so unique and loveable, Cece is such a bad b*tch who will never not be absolutely iconic, and Winston is just so odd but I love him too.

Top five characters: 1) Schmidt, 2) Nick Miller, 3) Cece Parekh, 4) Jessica Day and 5) Winston Bishop."
New Girl,Great Show!!!,"I really enjoy this show so far, only 3 episodes in, I can't believe the bad reviews people are giving it. Jess(Zooey) is so endearing and funny, some people are saying it's same show different actors, but really what show is this like? It's similar to three's company from 30 years ago. I really hope this show makes it, Zooey Deschanel is perfect for this character. This is the first review I've written, I check out a lot of shows but I really only enjoy a few and this is one. I was just appalled at what people were saying about this show. Sure I could take or leave the other guys in the show but maybe with time they will grow on you. Nick isn't so bad."
New Girl,Finally a Series with some intelligent jokes,"Now most of todays TV-shows are sitcoms, where the jokes 99 of a 100 times are cheap, cheap as ****.

The show is about 3 guys who let a girl move in and live them, which probably warns a lot of people that i think would like this show to not see this show.

But what it is about and what they do is far from anything important in a Comedy TV-Series.

The bottom line is, that this show has intelligent humor and another important ingredient is that the creators are spot on which characters that should have the most airtime."
New Girl,Excellent,"It made me laugh, it was excited, Jess and Nick have a lot of chemistry. This show just make my life better. The Winstons thing was perhaps a little silly but it did not obscure the emotion of the plot. Nick is an excellent actor he really makes us thing about that sloppy guy with a great heart. I wish this TV show never ends. I wouldn't know what to do."
New Girl,Jessica Day is the worst!,"The main character 'Jess' is insufferable. Having said that, the show is very entertaining due to great writing & EVERY OTHER ACTOR in the series. They all have great comedic timing. If you can deal with Zooey Deschanel & her character, you can enjoy this clever sitcom."
New Girl,Addicting Show!,"I saw a trailer for this show when it first aired and I thought it looked ""cute"" but not super interesting. I WAS SO WRONG. This show is spectacular. The humor is unbelievable. I really hate stupid awkward moments that make people uncomfortable, but the awkward moments in this show are so laughable it makes it so funny to watch. Each character has their own crazy personality. The characters remind me of The Big Bang Theory characters, each one is super important, has their own humor, and the chemistry is fantastic. I like how they make it OK to be adults in their 30s and not have their entire lives figured out and it's really relatable to a wide category of viewers. the main character Jess is adorable, hilarious, and so likable. Its great fun and super entertaining and you'll surely laugh out loud."
New Girl,Just Finished Season 5,"I will say, the show's quality started dropping more significantly in season 5. The episodes were better written in earlier seasons and characters were more consistent. But season 5 does some character development. Nick and Schmidt became my two favourites - where Bishop became pointless (in my personal opinion). To me Nick and Schmidt have the most character development - they've learned and grown from their experiences (though they do regress in some-odd episodes).

The show does still make me laugh out loud, but you can certainly tell that the writers are running out of episode ideas."
New Girl,"Schmidt 10, Nick 8, Winston 6, CeCe 7, Jess 4",The series after season 2 was basically carried by Schmidt and Nick and to a lesser extent Winston and CeCe. Jess became an annoying side part who at times seemed to put little effort into her performance. I loved it though. Max Greenfield is a fantastic actor.
New Girl,"I've tried to like it, I really have","I've watched most of the first season ... and every episode has a chuckle or two, but almost every show (watching via a recording) I find myself pausing it to see how much time is left and I am always at about the fifty percent point. What's up with that? This is something I NEVER do with a thirty minute sitcom.

I think this boredom is due to the story lines ... they are tired and the pace is slow. So I find myself wondering, do I want to suffer through another episode for a chuckle or two?

She's cute and she's funny, and the rest of the cast seems adequate but there is obviously something amiss. Fox is usually pretty quick to pull the plug so obviously others are seeing something I am not seeing but I'll probably only watch it when there is a story line that strikes my fancy."
New Girl,Absolutely Horrible!!!,"Overhyped!!! Jessica Day, the lead of the show is super annoying, non funny and a pathetic actor. She keeps singing all the time, and it's really really irritating. She is the main lead and she completely spoils the entire series with her partner in crime Nick.

Although, Schmidt is a delight, but Jess ruins it all. Nick Miller makes no sense. He is just unnecessarily given so much attention.

Other characters like Cece, Winston and Coach are good, but the show still fails to make you laugh at all. Somehow, tried watching it till fourth season but couldn't torture myself more. I still regret wasting my time on this."
BoJack Horseman,This show! Is! Too much! Man!,"Seriously though. Best show currently on television. At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different. For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever."

BoJack Horseman,The story of a horse that changed my life,"The story of a horse that changed my life. Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that. At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time. Anyway, let's start the review. The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons. The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that. One of the few offers that deserves a high rating. My rating 9.8"
BoJack Horseman,The Real Real,"Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?

What does it mean?

What does it try to reflect?

Why does it feel so real?

I'll tell you in one word: because it is REAL. As real can get..

It's every miserable dark corner of everyone's life that all of us is just too upset or tiny to talk about. It is the real real, showing every ugly and every petty, showing that we are just a piece of dust in this universe which is billions of years older than us, that we are meaningless and mostly little nothings, but we all want to be worth something...

It is made as an animated 'cartoon' in which animals are like people, dumb jokes top even dumber jokes and it is goofy, but just to get the inner child out of you to keep you hooked, but if you are left believing that its just a goofy dumb show, then it is not for you and please leave it alone..it is life, human nature, a never ending art. And for you others, brothers, we are all Bojack Horseman's and you just need to let it go..try not to think about it. Live your life, be happy with stupid stuff, maybe find the love of your life.. just stay happy and loyal to the most importants. I love you:) And for the creators and masterminds behind the show, thank you so so much, you have my full attention, you answered a lot of questions that I could never find the answers for.. just thank you:)"
BoJack Horseman,A Rare Experience,"I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.

It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.

I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.

And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's ""too good"" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.

So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.

But that's alright. Because in the moment, it was something memorable."
BoJack Horseman,Netflix has made a cartoon for the ages!,"BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.

I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves. This is a show that rewards your patience and loyalty to it ten-fold.

Netflix's animation achievement gets 5/5 stars."
BoJack Horseman,The best adult animated show,"Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out."
BoJack Horseman,An animated show that feels more real than most live-action series.,"Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise.

It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle.

For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona.

Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story.

I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us."
BoJack Horseman,Excellent,"One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz"
BoJack Horseman,A really good show,"The thing with BoJack Horseman is that it takes a couple of episodes to find its stride and those first couple of episodes have caused many a person to stop watching. It's a shame, because it ends up being really great, with moments that are poignant and sad and really sort of grab you in a way you don't expect.

Every actor is terrific, the animation is good, it's just an all around great show. It's not quite quite Archer, but then what is, you know? I loved this and ended up watching the entire series in one sitting which is a shame because I have nothing to look forward to until / if they go for a second season."

BoJack Horseman,Depressing Apathy toward Life,"Beyond the inside jokes and meta-humor best suited to the writers themselves than a mainstream audience (this is a Netflix series after all), this show reveals the nihilism that has grabbed hold of Hollywood and our vain, materialistic culture. What do you expect, when everything from promiscuity to profanity, from drug addiction to backstabbing, is now the norm?

The show tries to push some kind of moral struggle through the main character, who is toxic to his own relationships but tries to do good nonetheless. And yet, whatever accomplishments he makes in this struggle don't seem to matter much in the context of this mean and indifferent world that the writers have created for him to inhabit.

Forget about the strange phenomenon of humans coexisting with what are basically humans with animal heads. What kind of fictional animated world is this, where career women feel guilty for having natural human emotions, where friends threaten to kill each other (for laughs), and where rappers make music videos about how violence perpetrated against the defenseless unborn is ""cool"" and ""hardcore""? Not to mention where characters often seem lost in nostalgia, as if to imply that the present world has turned into a hellhole of abandonment and despair. (It kind of has.) But if Bojack Horseman is trying to be as profound as so many critics say it is, why keep dwelling on the negatives of modern life instead of making an effort to show how things ought to be? Being realistic and ""down to earth"" only gets you so far unless you can build a constructive message from it, and Horseman's fatal flaw is its refusal to tackle real human problems seriously. It pretends to, but its quick diversion to flat gags and standard sitcom resolutions can only mean that it has no real answers for us. It's a sad sight, in all honesty."
BoJack Horseman,A Surprisingly Entertaining Series,"Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come."
BoJack Horseman,Every episode is a truck load of emotions and you will require Therapy,"Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!!"
BoJack Horseman,Superb dark comedy,"In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.

This dark comedy is an excellent analysis of human nature, mental health, and the question of redemption. Be prepared that Bojack really does some awful things, though the show wisely paces them out. Yet, the show also manages to make you feel for Bojack. To clarify, the show never validates his actions. In fact, there is self-criticism of the its own anti-hero genre. The writing, characterization, and use of continuity in this show is EXCELLENT.

Though the last paragraph makes this sound super dramatic, there's plenty of comedy and it's really, really funny. There is some really cutting satire of Hollywood and showbusiness. The show does a good job of balancing the darker aspects with lighter stuff. Bojack's goofy, carefree longtime house guest Todd (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) is a great balance with his wacky misadventures.

Also, this is that rare show that never drops a beat. All six seasons are quality, including the last one whose cancellation was sudden.

I can't recommend this enough. This show is pure genius."
BoJack Horseman,Wow.,"Now that the show is over, I need to shout a big thank you to the it and all the people that made it happen. Just, just that.

Thank you."
BoJack Horseman,One of the best adult animated shows I've ever seen.,"While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed.

I can't even put my thoughts into words for this review because I love this show so much, which is very surprising, I try to stay as formal as possible. I won't spoil anything, but there was a few different episodes in the past 2 seasons that made me cry, scream, hate, love, everything. This is really one of the few animated shows I can think of that brings on pure, unaltered moments of absolute emotion from the deep dark places of my soul. I connected in ways I never would have thought possible to Bojack, as well as a few other characters in the show. This is a must watch for anybody and everybody, you just have to get past the first half of the first season to truly start to love it.

Oh, and the show is also outstandingly funny. Worthwhile as a comedy alone."
BoJack Horseman,"Not only the best cartoon ever, but one of the best TV shows ever created","When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready."
BoJack Horseman,A Masterpiece,"I don't know why I took so long to watch this one, it had been recommended to me to plenty of times for the last few years. This became my favorite adult animated show. Rick and Morty is good with the subjects of nihilism and it has it's depiction of self destructive depression but it doesn't get it quite as right as BoJack Horseman. Every form of depression is presented in this show and they're presented in such an accurate way, I had tears in my eyes watching a talking horse go through similar situations I have been in. In some ways I relate to BoJack but I saw myself more in the characters of Diane and Princess Caroline. That's the beauty of this show, every character is relatable in some way but the way they've been written is so natural, it's not a forced depiction of the various damaged type of folks that exist in society.

The character development in this show is phenomenal. We see BoJack's ongoing struggle with depression, trying really hard to be a better person but falling back into his toxic patterns. Every season he digs himself into a deeper hole because he refuses to fix himself, because he believes he can't be fixed - this is present in the character of Diane as well but her forms of self sabotage are more subtle. Different forms of depression are shown from substance abuse to self delusion and they're all presented in the most accurate way. I love the episodes where we get into the heads of BoJack, Diane, and Princess Caroline. We see how BoJack has an ongoing battle in his head going from positives to absolute negatives, he tries to have self love but it immediately transitions to self hatred. Diane can't forget the hurt she faced in her early years, constantly hearing her father and school bullies talking her down. Princess Caroline helps herself feel better by imagining her grandchild talk about her successes in the future. The way these moments are shown, even the style of animation they choose to present these moments, it's just a brilliant work of art altogether.

The show definitely has its many moments of humor, this is a comedy after all. Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter provide the comic relief although they have their deep moments as well, but the show does an incredible job of showing you that although these characters may appear stupid, they're actually the happiest people in the entire series. Both of them have their tough moments but they both rise out of their problems better than the other characters because they're happy. I love that they have BoJack admit to Mr. Peanutbutter that the main reason he does not like to be around him is because he envies him for his happiness, that was such a powerful moment. I hadn't seen a moment that powerful in a film or series in so long and I didn't expect to see it in a show about a talking depressed has-been horse.

Honestly I can go on and on about how amazed I am with this show. I can even write an entire essay about how this show properly depicts mental illness. As someone who still battles with depression here and there, I felt completely understood with this show. Finally someone got it right and it was a show in a universe where talking animals cohabitate with humans. I will rewatch this many more times. It's a show that knew when it was time to end and connected every single story they told until the very end. The writing in this show, to all the writers out there that want to tell great stories on screen or even in a book, watch this show and take notes.

I love BoJack Horseman, thank you the team that brought this show to life. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm an eternally grateful to know this show exists and understood my pain in a way I never thought any form of media could completely understand - in a way I had not felt since Amy Winehouse released Back to Black. Highly recommend this show, you will not regret it. It's a masterpiece."
BoJack Horseman,Colourful psychedelic journey through the dark night of the soul.,"I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old. I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else. While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it. I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating. Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman"
BoJack Horseman,Imaginative,"Wow. Bojack Horseman is an amazing show with fascinating episodes that are creative and unique for TV today. It deals with deep and complex characters and faces so many issues with a refreshing style. Some episodes are incredibly emotional and extremely immersive. However, I felt the earlier seasons were not as good as the later seasons - my personal favourite being season 4 as the main storyline dealt with a complicated, depressing issue in a breathtaking way. Bojack Horseman is not the funniest show, there are plenty of chuckles though. Overall this show was amazing with great writing and was something so different to everything else I have seen."
BoJack Horseman,"Starts off nice, but gets old fast...","BoJack Horseman has a nice premise (and some clever characters), but the show's sad scenes, and plots are tarnished by the fact the almost every episode ends with a few sad scenes (the show loses it's sense of emotional attachment). That also creates a very repetitive feel. .... ......"

Rainbow Rangers,Colorful fail,"Rainbow Bright and Captain Planet had a baby. Luckily she's pretty because there's not much else going on here.

If you skip the opening credits, you'll still hear the full song at least twice per episode. The voices are worse than Paw Patrol, and the story telling falls way short. The show has a unicorn that only says it's name, a la Groot, but it's not endearing.

I'm not sure how we are supposed to know who these characters are, or where they're from, or what connection they have with Earth since they live on fake Asgard.

Also, stop trying to make 'Splendiferous' happen. It's not going to happen!

Rainbow Rangers,Problematic,Preston Praxton just tricked the rainbow rangers into some kind of pod then pushed it off his boat to the bottom of the ocean. When they figured their way out and resurfaced they offered him an idea to make him even richer! WHAT?!!
Rainbow Rangers,Pretty bad show.,"The show could have potential but because of glaring one sided political agendas makes this show worst than captain planet and less entertaining. I dont mind helping the environment but using propaganda to kids shouldn't be it.

The show is several ""rangers"" with different powers that help the environment. This show has some episodes that the rangers will save an animal from a storm or reunit a family of hedgehogs but then you have the villain episodes which instead of teaching how to use, repair or replant the environment is alway humans are greedy and bad and messing up environment is bad; just like captain planet. The all girl team's villain are mostly Male. I rather my child to learn equality regardless of race or gender not girls dominate boys.

The actual characters are lack luster. They only do a few things and floof the rainbow unicorn thing seems to be the swiss army knife of anything they need. Most of the voice actors are monotone and have little to no reflection in their voices and most have annoying voices. This makes boring characters more uninteresting.

Last is the child test. Does my 2 year old daughter like it? She turns the tv off anytime the show comes on. Thats pretty bad since she enjoys every other nick jr show. This show is not entertaining at all."
Rainbow Rangers,Manure,"Manure of the most putrid kind.

For all parents subjected this, may god have mercy on your souls."
Rainbow Rangers,Great show,My kids love this show and all the kids in school love it as well.
Rainbow Rangers,Great Idea,A Captain Planet message for younger kids! Mine loves it and she's 3.
Rainbow Rangers,Uncle Approved!,"The nieces are obsessed and oddly my younger nephew too 😂 The song is catchy, the episodes are short for their attention span and there are some nature and animal facts sprinkled in for food measure. Better than a lot of the other things they make me watch with them 🤣"
Rainbow Rangers,Very educational for kids.,My kids love watching it! It helps them understand how we are hurting our planet and the animals we share it with. It's a show all kids should be watching!
Rainbow Rangers,The kids love it,"All the kids seem to love the show. The adults, no so much. Anyway, it's nice to have more kids shows on Netflix."
Rainbow Rangers,Catchy,My 2yo and I aren't really fans of show perse but she plays the intro at least 3x a day for about 6 months now. We tried to watch the show a few times meh. I would've gave it a 4 rating but went wit 10 stars bcuz of catchy song n my daughter sounds so cute singing it!
Rainbow Rangers,Great series,Amazingly done. My daughter can't stop laughing and watching. Wish it will continue.
Rainbow Rangers,Great message. Great cartoon,My daughter loves this show. Also has a great message about ways to care for and protect our environment.
Rainbow Rangers,Reviewed on behalf of a 4 year old.,"This cartoon isn't meant for me so for me to review it is pointless. On behalf of my 4 year old I am giving it a 10. She loves it and that is all you need to know. We have spent a good few hours playing Rainbow Rangers where I have to be the bad guy and do evil plans and boobytraps. It has been great fun and she has learnt a thing or two along the way as well. I hope it brings happiness to more young children. It's standard formulaic kid's television. The Rangers are playing, something in the world is wrong, they get called to action, 3 of them are arbitrarily picked to solve it, they find out the same bad guy is to blame, they solve it, the end."
Rainbow Rangers,5yr old daughter is in love with this,"Shes already asking for outfits and toys, very educational , and she loves it cant wait for more"
Rainbow Rangers,Girl power,Rainbow Rangers is a show that teaches children about the environment. My children love it.
Rainbow Rangers,Great kid's show,Great show for kids. My girls love it. It's also informative and educational. Shows right from wrong.
Rainbow Rangers,Adorable,"They are so cute, my nieces LOVE them. Love the colors and and action."
Rainbow Rangers,Solid,Is it entertaining my infant? Yes. Is it captain planet meets care bears? Certainly. Will my kid want all the eventual figures? Probably. Will I buy them? Arguably.
Rainbow Rangers,Good show,Kids like it. something that's age appropriate and they enjoy
Rainbow Rangers,My twin girls are obsessed,"Maybe I should let them write the review haha. They love it, though. Their first real obsession. They love the characters and - a lot like the Dora Explorer's and Blue's Clues, of past - Rainbow Rangers is healthy and very helpful in helping young minds begin to understand the world. I want my babies to learn as much information as they can to make solid, well-rounded decisions. I know that myself, my wife, their educators, and peers will teach them a lot; however, media will be a huge influence over them, like it or not. With that being said, Rainbow Rangers is a hit.

Also, check out Llama Llama on Netflix, another massive hit in our household."
Rainbow Rangers,It is a great show for kids,My son and daughter can watch this show for hours.
Rainbow Rangers,A bad mashup of old shows that embodies the worst of kids TV,"It's like someone tried to put together Captain Planet, the Paw Patrol, Rainbow Bright, and just a hint of Pokémon with the purpose of selling toys.

The villains are even more one dimensional than the Captain Planet villains with the twist of sometimes not being irredeemable. The format of an episode is nearly a carbon copy of Paw Patrol (complete with ""Kalia needs us!"") but with even worse plot lines. The entire rainbow aesthetic feels recycled, and the Floof character is like something from the Pokémon cutting room floor.

From a structural point of view, the selection of characters for the plot often feels unmatched to the conflict (like not brining Anna on missions involving animals). The abilities of some of the characters don't feel thought out either.

When looking for more information on the show, supposedly the character of BB is supposed to be autistic but she just comes off as aping the worst of 80s 'brainy' characters rather than the stated intention.

While the goal of teaching environmental awareness is admirable, it would be better if there had been some attempt to more accurately portray the issues and possible solutions (or even admit that more work needs to be done in some areas).

Overall, the show feels like the kind of cash grab it's main villain Preston would try."
Rainbow Rangers,A hit with my 3 year old girl and my 5 year old boy!,We are very particular with what we let our kids watch and this is one of the few shows we let them watch. I love the fact it has a strong environmental theme as this is part of our lifestyle. It is a kids cartoon though and it is entertaining enough to keep my kids still for 20 minutes.
Rainbow Rangers,MY FLOOF!z,Who names a unicorn floof I'm offended there is only one floof and that's POOMIN 🐶 !!!

Vanished 46,On The Fence,"I'm still not sure if I actually liked this movie or not.....there was so much going on, odd subplots, and unresolved non-issues that made it all confusing. For starters, it was at least 45 minutes too long, several times I thought it was gonna wrap up, then off they went again in a new direction. A lot of character behavior that didn't seem terribly believable; I found myself laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny. And they made darn sure you knew that EVERY minor character could be the ""bad guy"" by giving them all exaggerated creepy habits, tics, and secrets that were quite over the top.

It was plenty suspenseful in many places but at times again ventured into is-that-supposed-to-be-funny....?

I give it a resounding ""meh""."
Vanished 46,Decent thriller debut,"The most creepy part is to read reviews from people who actually watched 10 mins or who watched till the very end and still didn't get it. I wonder why do they have this urge to leave a comment the most?

I started to watch with absolutely no expectations but it turned out to be quite entertaining. There were few holes but all in all it's a pretty decent thriller with good twists. Good job!"
Vanished 46,Keep going and it almost works,"You will wonder what level of hell you've wandered into when you first start watching this. The acting is dire. The editing is terrible. There are so many utterly baffling decisions made that you will find it very hard to sympathise with anyone at all. But, hang on...the last 10 minutes suddenly makes it all (almost) worth it, and with the benefit of hindsight you'll find yourself going...ohhhh...NOW I see... 6 stars because it's actually not awful and the ending is actually quite surprising and a little heartbreaking."
Vanished 46,Not bad!,"This movie turned out to be fairly decent. Some of the acting wasn't the greatest, but I did enjoy the film. I've got to admit I didn't expect the twist in the end. Worth a watch."
Vanished 46,"The acting gets explained, sorta...",Comentario no disponible
Vanished 46,Hard to Watch,"The acting is atrocious. The script is plastic. The dialogue will make you cringe.

Every single scene made me want to punch myself in the face.

The final twist, which you'll see coming from miles away, does explain the implausible actions of the characters, but doesn't make the acting any less painful to watch.

Everyone involved in making this film is a seasoned professional, but this is amateur hour. Absolutely dire."
Vanished 46,Stick With It,"Okay, so there's a lot going on in this movie the plot rambles around a bit. The acting is only ok, with good turns from Jason Patric (Sheriff) and Thomas (Paul). It's hitchcockian in its style and the ending threw me BIG TIME (no spoilers). It's no classic and has more holes than Swiss cheese, but stick with this one and you'll be glad you did!"

Vanished 46,Pretty awful,Interesting premise. Terrible script. Horrible acting. I mean horrible. Every time someone speaks it reminds you how terrible the film is.
Vanished 46,Once you get to the end you realize the acting here is great!,"I love a good mystery thriller and this one truly delivers in a way that is both unexpected and brilliant, pointing subtle fingers that make for a great puzzle, pulling out the tension at all the right moments, and popping out surprises that are jaw-dropping. That's my personal opinion, from someone who appreciates great mystery thrillers like Cape Fear, The 6th Sense, and Identity among others. Kudos to Peter Facinelli for a great film and to all the actors for tremendous acting. Worth the watch."
Vanished 46,Worth a watch if you like mystery thrillers,"I found this movie very interesting. I liked all the twists and turns, and the ending is very surprising and satiating. Sure there are several misdirects that other reviews site as plot holes. But if you think about it later each subplot has a thread tying it back to the main story of the missing daughter."
Vanished 46,Worst acting I have seen in a movie,"This was on Netflix in the top ten movies of the week. They need to also state that is one of the worst movies made. The acting is consistent, consistently poor! Skip this movie."
Vanished 46,Surprisingly GOOD!!!,"I'm always a little wary of other people's reviews, as many of our younger generation prefers constant action, entertainment and stimulation. So if that's what you're looking for, then this isn't the film for you. Although there are many ""jump scare"" sequences, the film moves along at an occasionally slow-to-moderate speed, and yet it's entirely gripping.

Anne Heche does a fabulous job, and her performance as the overwrought mother looking for her lost child was entirely convincing. One of my favorite elements was the fact that the film keeps you guessing until the end, and suspecting everyone in its path as the abductor. And by the way, for anyone who claims to have ""predicted"" the ending after only 10 minutes into the film, they're full of sh$t. This movie was well-written and formulated to keep you guessing. Overall, it was an impressive feat for Peter Facinelli."

Vanished 46,Decent twist,Comentario no disponible
Vanished 46,Truly awful.,I don't blame the actors. The screenplay and director are solely responsible for this garbage. Hard to believe just how bad it is. The one star is for the scenery.
Vanished 46,"Flawed, but still enjoyable, considering the newb filmmaker.","Actor turned newb writer and director Peter Facinelli, wore all three hats in this B-grade film, and although flawed, it was still enjoyable. New filmmakers have to start somewhere, right? This was his 3rd full length feature film, and I've seen much worse from seasoned filmmakers lately. My biggest issue was the terrible acting by Anne Heche and especially Thomas Jane and his changing weird voice, but some of that blame also falls on the inexperience of the newb director not directing his cast and scenes effectively. Overall though, the directing was fairly decent as was the camera work. The cinematography and score were on point. The writing did have some plot and technical issues, and the pacing needed to be faster and/or the films 115 min runtime edited or cut down to around 90 mins. But the overall story with its twists and turns and surprise ending was conceived very well - it was worth the slow pacing and long runtime. If you enjoy mystery thrillers with some scary moments, you will enjoy this one. Watching it a second time knowing the ending is like watching a different movie, which is well put together. Ignore the wannabe critics and their ridiculously low ratings... it's a solid and well deserved 7/10 from me."
Vanished 46,What joke,Comentario no disponible
Vanished 46,Deserves a higher rating - Nice movie with a proper ending,"The movie was nice and had a proper ending which is a lot of ask in these times of idiotic 'open-endings' which apparently the director 'intends' (and totally not because they're an incompetent moron without the guts to pick an ending).

If people are finding it 'slow', watch it in 2x, geez. The story is not slow and makes decent amount of progress and tries hard to throw you off.

All in all, an enjoyable movie (in 2x) if you don't analyze it to death and try to look for loopholes.

Deserves atleast a 6.5/10."
Vanished 46,A good thriller with a very interesting twist...,"I knew I was sitting down for a thriller when I sat down to watch the 2020 movie ""Hour of Lead"" (aka ""The Vanished""), and I knew that it had Thomas Jane and Anne Heche on the cast list. And that is essentially all I knew about the movie when I decided to watch it.

However, I must say that writer and director Peter Facinelli definitely managed to come up with a movie that was quite entertaining. And the storyline was very compelling and drew me in right away. I will admit that the movie wasn't as predictable as many thrillers tend to be, and the twists to the storyline were quite interesting and nicely executed.

The storyline was good, and it was a nicely told storyline from writer and director Peter Facinelli. It was definitely a very entertaining story and one that brings the audience right in there with the grieving parents.

""Hour of Lead"" has some good performances from Thomas Jane and Anne Heche. But it also have a memorable performance by Jason Patric. All in all, the acting in the movie was good, and people were doing great jobs in bringing their characters to life on the screen.

Normally I don't watch a lot of thrillers, but ""Hour of Lead"" is definitely well worth the time, money and effort. So if you get the chance to watch it, I can strongly recommend that you do so.

My rating of ""Hour of Lead"" (or ""The Vanished"") is a strong seven out of ten stars."
Vanished 46,All this movie needed was...,"This movie would have been OK with a totally different story, a completely different cast, an entirely different plot, and a different title. I wish I could have given it -89 stars because all I wanted to do was smash Anne Heche upside her head with a boat oar for the length of the movie. God she was a mega beee-otch! Don't watch this. You're better off spending your time putting your balls in a blender with jalapeños."
Vanished 46,Not what I expected (major spoilers),Comentario no disponible
Vanished 46,A Different Kind of Story,"This is a very strange story, with plenty of suspense and an element of horror.

The Anne Heche character is very unlikable and isn't easy to watch by times, but in the end I realized she was the right person for the role.

The story is well-written and keeps you guessing until the end."

The Mars Generation,"The adults are great, the kids are hard to watch","This film lays out the history of plans for human exploration of mars very well, especially Warner von Braun's involvement. However the brief interviews with kids attending space camp or hard to watch, while I appreciate their passion , That passion quickly turns to overconfidence, needlessly peppering their speech with technical jargon. That passion comes off more as cosplay unfortunately"

Russian Doll,Self-help for all depressed people out there,Comentario no disponible
Russian Doll,Watch Season 1 and Stop,"Season 1 was fresh and worth every minute of full attention, solid 9/10, might even up that to a 10 after a re-watch some time later. But Season 2... is like it's not even the same show. There's barely any hint of a story and most of what happens is uninteresting. I'm only halfway in and I struggle to find a reason to keep moving and to watch another episode.

I wanted to average out the ratings for the two seasons like I usually do, but you know what, people might skip the very good Season 1 if they see that kind of rating, so I'll do what I saw someone else on here do and just rate the good part to draw attention to it."
Russian Doll,This is not a comedy (fortunately).,"Wow. What a ride. This series compelled me to reactivate my account to write a review.

First of all - please do not expect laugh out loud comedy. This is a very dark and sometimes very unpleasant series. Yet, it is sometimes hilarious in its own way.

The story of Russian Doll is based on a now often used device, granted. But it is by no means formulaic. In fact, there are so many twists and turns in the development section of the 8 episodes, you will be glued to the screen.

Some people didn't like the main character, calling her nasty and unpleasant. But this is the point of the series! She is a deeply troubled person. But trust me, she will become likeable soon enough - and stay tuned for the arrival of another main character (played by Charlie Barnett), who totally makes up for everything cringeworthy the potty-mouthed character played by Natasha Lyonne did until this point.

In the end, I promise you, you will have watched a cathartic experience that will leave you very happy.

On the technical level, Russian Doll is unusually well shot. The lighting reminds me of classic Mario Bava movies (I think this is intentional), and the music is very well sought.

So, go watch this, and please watch beyond episode 3, you will thank me later.

If only all takes on old plot devices were this awesome! Netflix, you need to give us more like this, not that narcissistic crap that so often pops up lately (Girl Boss, Insatiable with TRULY unlikeable characters)."
Russian Doll,What have I just watched?,"It's brilliant!

An extremely weird but captivating story, great acting, excellent script, natural dialogue, very good production values and a fantastic range of characters.

I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The funniest saddest weird thing ever. Kafkaesque and slapstick at the same time.

Do not ruin it with a second series."
Russian Doll,Do not give up at the beginning! Wait and be rewarded!,"Boy I hated this show so much at the beginning! It was awful, not funny, pretensious, pseudo intelectual! For the first 3 episodes boy I was almost giving up... And then it wasn't! Those first episodes are there for a reason and it pays off. Must watch TV. You will not regret giving it a chance past the first few episodes."
Russian Doll,So many layers,"I just finished binging Russian Dolls, and it was awesome. While it's loaded with dark humor, this show is not a a comedy, but so much more. Its smorgasbord of topics, including loneliness, guilt, depression, fear, forgiveness, and moving forward."
Russian Doll,Wow. The critics got it right this time.,"I don't usually write reviews but I ended up staying up all night/morning watching this. I don't have much to say as I don't want to spoil anything. But the acting is great, the humour is great and the mystery is really interesting and will keep you interested from episode to episode. Highly recommend."
Russian Doll,Season 2's difficult second album syndrome,"S1 seemed so perfect and contained that news of an S2 routinely perplexed people. I think people were right; there was nowhere really to go. Lots of back story filled out here - with the primary magic now being time travel, it's basically all about back story - but, somehow, it feels like we didn't need it terribly much. There are, I guess, good and dutiful points being made about understanding what previous generations went through and how that shaped us, especially our spiky bits, but in practice I just don't feel it all with the intensity and enjoyment that I did S1."
Russian Doll,I quite liked it,"After two episodes I was hooked. I did get a bit scared at a point, but I'm a wuss. Really enjoyable all throughout. Doesn't really have anything to do with Groundhog day, apart from the timeloop thing. Reviewers who claim so haven't watched more than 1 episode and shouldn't be taken seriously."
Russian Doll,"Season 1 excellent, season 2 not so good","Loved season 1, excellent storyline. 10/10

Didn't like season 2, terrible, confusing and boring storyline. 2/10.

Don't think I'll bother with season 3 if there is one. One of the many TV series that should just leave the sequels alone."
Russian Doll,Amy Poehler and Natasha Lyonne 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾,"In semi-typical fashion it started a little slow in interest for me but I watched the first episode and said,""Ok, one more..."" And then of course you get the obligatory, ""Well, I HAVE to see what happens next.."" which is followed by, ""Well, who the hell is THIS character?"" And then of course the reaction of, "" Oh Hell Naw!"" Which proceeds the ever popular, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?"" But then you get the ""Oh I got this"" episode. Only to be smacked by the "" Whoa.... didn't see THAT coming"" show. Which all is summed up with ""More please..""

bravo 👏🏾Netflix, Natasha Lyonne, Amy Poehler & Russian Doll 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾

Russian Doll,How to murder a great idea,"Can't blame the pandemic on this one 2019 one of Netflix's finest freshest shows of the year, I've watched season 1 multiple times long awaiting the much delayed season 2. The closing scene of season 1 was so tantalising as it really did leave you thinking 🤔 well where does that leave us?

I will tell you . Nowhere! No continuity, no real explanation as to what's been going on. A subplot thrown in so you feel important if you can follow it. No dark comedy. We waited 3 yrs for this.

My advice is Russian doll is a great stand alone 1 season, I'd give it a 9 but the 2nd season can't be ignored that's why I've ranked it so low.

Please put it to sleep."
Russian Doll,Entertaining but disintegrating in series 2,"As most reviewers, I found series 1 watchable and entertaining enough, despite main character Nadia being a rather annoying character. Still, the re-birth after each gruesome death had an element of black humor and suspense, and the Alan character moved the plot forward, towards an end that was simplistic to the point of stupidity, but wrapped up the series nicely.

Obviously it would be quite difficult for everyone to understand that at some stage the purpose of life could be saving a perfect stranger who appeared for a few seconds in the background, but whatever... as Nadia would say.

However, series 2 is a different animal altogether. Gone is the humour, the consistency and the indispensable presence of Alan. What happens is a sequence of random time trips back to the 80s and 1944, during which we further discover what an eminently dislikable character Nadia's mother is, glued with a useless side plot of Alan in East Berlin in the 60s. Each and every episode suffers from considerable randomness and Nadia trying too hard to be funny cracking silly jokes and chain smoking. Is the show sponsored by tobacco companies?"
Russian Doll,Genius show,"Natasha Lyonne is a genius. This show is incredible and a must see. The talent from Lyonne and the rest of the cast in first class and I strongly believe this will be one of, if not the best show to air on Netflix this year!"
Russian Doll,"S1: The energy, heart, and performances carry it above what it could have been","There is a lot I could have not liked about Russian Doll. I could have taken against it for being overhyped for what it is. I certainly could have been put off by the very confident and brash Nu Yark characters and their very polished lives and homes. Probably the Groundhog Day gimmick would have struck me as uninspired too. All of these things were still there, and a few more, but yet it mostly worked for me, and charmed me into it. Pace and tone are a big part of this as the episodes are just the right length, have good timing throughout, and tend to have the right energy level so you don't feel rushed but yet it has a speed to it that works well.

It does have its heart in the right place too; for all its modern trimmings and cynicism, it is ultimately about connections and people. I don't think it pulls it altogether and makes a great whole in the way that others seem to have felt it did, but it engaged me into the two main characters and made me care for them and like them. The conclusion doesn't matter so much as the journey, and for the characters this is an engaging one. The performances help sell it convincingly, and like everyone says - Lyonne is great throughout. Production-wise, the show looks and sounds great, which helps the energy levels and slickness - it doesn't make the show, but it lubricates it and keeps it moving in the superficial areas, helping the core elements which are more important but harder to do.

It's a lot more ""acquired taste"" than the critical response would suggest, but even when I could see the weaknesses and shortcomings, I still found it very easy to enjoy."
Russian Doll,Best new show to binge,"Not only is it the best new show to binge, it is specifically designed to binge. Russian Doll possess the dark grey tone of 'A Hand Maids Tail,' the existential humor of 'The Good Place,' and the twistedness of 'Black Mirror.' Russian doll, with an all female writing, and directing team evolves beyond the hint of gender non conformity, to a level of gender non compliance, or maybe even non existence. Russian doll is a true, deep, dark, intelligent masterpiece. Russian dolls transcends time, morality, gender and genres. The secret to its brilliance is within the mood, because although you are witnessing the darkest moments of these characters many timelines, the story maintains a somber innate sense of humor. It is truly the most engaging and entertaining show on Netflix."
Russian Doll,Fantastic,"Just watched all 8 episodes it is highly recommended binge worthy TV. Should have gave it 10/10 really. Great Story, AmaZing Acting, well written Loved it from start to finish. All the characters bring so many different layers to such an amazing story"
Russian Doll,Great show!,"The concept isn't new as we have seen it already in many other places but the way it is presented in this show is incredible. I've finished watching it today and I must say ,Go and watch it because it's worth it. The story , the acting are both great ! I laughed a lot and had a lot of good time so this show is a must watch."
Russian Doll,Season 2 is an insult to the fans of this series.,"Season 2 ruined this creative , sharp, funny , cynical and very dark series for me , it was rushed and dull , ipso facto won't watch season 3 if there ever is one."
Russian Doll,A scorcher of a show.,Comentario no disponible
Russian Doll,"Season 1 was better, they should have just stopped there","I just finished season 2 and it was quite disappointing. At least season 1 picks up halfway through, season 2 just seems to be going nowhere. Quite boring but I kept watching hoping it would get better. Nadia seemed very annoying this time, you don't want to root for her at all. Was barely interested in Alan's story. Giving it 6 stars because of season 1."
Russian Doll,A really enjoyable gem,"This series surprised me.

The first episode is overall not bad and gives the impression that the rest of the series will be a bit of a whacky fun comedy.

And that's kind of true, but with each episode the story takes a more serious turn and pulls you into the character back stories more and more... and it does it really well!

It turned out to be a really enjoyable emotional journey with some good (albeit dark) laughs along the way."
Russian Doll,Season 1 is spectacular. Season 2 is super weak.,"This show probably should've just been a limited series. Season 1 was terrific. The perfect amount of humor and mystery. Great writing and great acting.

The quality falls off a cliff with season 2. I appreciate that the writers didn't want to recycle the same idea, I really do. The result is weak and convoluted. This just proves the point more that it should've been a one and done. The acting is over the top and obnoxious. Alan's story is the only redeemable aspect of this season."
Russian Doll,"Season 1 was great, season 2 kind of a train wreck","I thought season 1 was great, definitely had me looking forward to another season, but season 2 was basically a train wreck imo, it was just all over the place and definitely not in a good way. I know some people will disagree and can't handle people having their own opinions, but it was just too many things going on and focus was just not there, and the season finale just didn't bring this mess together. I wish I could rate it higher but season 2 is just forgettable at best."

生活如沸,"Great show, just wish the episodes were longer","If you're interested in Chinese culture and eating, this show is definitely going to be up your alley. I first was introduced to hot pot when I had Chinese roommates during a year of university and they treated me to a hot pot during Chinese New Year. I've been interested in Chinese culture ever since.

This show really dives into not just the food and different hot pot traditions (which are many and different depending on the region), but also how the act of eating together which the hot pot encourages shapes Chinese familial ties and friendships. The episodes take you all over China and you get to learn about some interesting people and what got them into making and/or eating hot pot.

This leads to my only complaint (more like a wish): I wish the episodes were longer because the people and their stories/family history are so interesting but since multiple people are interviewed/featured in each episode you only get to learn a little bit and then it switches to another person's story, just as you feel like you're getting to know them. They're often such interesting people that you wish the show was a bit longer so that you could learn more about them.

Overall this is a great show that will teach you a bit about Chinese hot pot, Chinese culture, and how important food is to families and communities. I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning about China or Chinese culture and food. In a day and age that glorifies superficiality, this show will give you that warm feeling you get from watching something that is both family friendly but also has an optimistic view of life, its good times and even its challenges."
Cunk on Earth,As clever as stupid gets,"Charlie Brooker and Diane Morgan's horrendous, wonderful creation Philomena Cunk returns for another outing in this series. Cunk is amazing: stupid, credulous, only superficially interested in anything other than herself, with the ability to draw the wrong inference from just about everything. The writing is brilliant, a clever parody of mainstream ""quality"" television as well as an airing for the character; but Morgan plays the part so well its hard to believe she is acting. Surely her interviewees know what is coming; nonetheless, they do their best to take her as seriously as possible. It's great."
Cunk on Earth,Pump Up the Jam,"Irreverent, downright funny. It's a mockumentary after all. It's the whole of human history in 5 short episodes. It's a refreshing tack on our story through the millennia. What a story. Better still, what a storyteller Diane Morgan is.

There's not a frame where I was either smiling or laughing. Her delivery, thanks to the guy or gal who made the script, is so amazingly funny. You learn a bit more of history while she entertains you with her quips and utterly nonsensical questions.

I bet she's the first one to get away with it. Yet, the viewer should thank her and the production staff, especially the writer, for bringing to our living room this lively seminar on our history. Truly, as Philomena Cunk, points out in the end: humankind is on a crossroads. Still, pump up the jam!"
Cunk on Earth,Brilliantly funny... every statement is a jewel,"I can watch the same episode like 20 times and still laugh to death. The script and dialogues are so brilliant. Each statement about human evolution contains a jewel in word playing- It is a pure Groucho Marx adaptation of Planet Earth. And Diane is just AMAZING. I don't even know how she does it to hold her face straight during some of the interviews... I had seen her in After Life and others and you notice right away how funny she can get. She deserves a price for this one and Cunk on Britain. It doesn't matter if they talk about dogs, discovering fire or cave paintings, there is always a brilliant sentence for each... A must see if you want to have some great laughs. So brilliant and funny."
Cunk on Earth,Literally crying with laughter,"I am not a fan of comedies, because, ironically, I generally do not find them funny, so I almost bypassed this Netflix series, until I realised it was British, and seriously, who are funnier than the Brits?

I'm so glad I clicked on Cunk. The deadpanned delivery, and the almost naive earnestness with which the questions are delivered to the experts is absolutely genius and hilarious. The experts are probably the stars of this series, vacillating between near hysteria to incredulity.

Only complaint I have about this series is that there are only five episodes, although I don't know if my heart could handle any more than that."
Cunk on Earth,Ali G 2.0,"First off, Diane is brilliant.

Second, whoever wrote this is a bloody genius.

Third, there's so much going on and being said that you MUST watch it over and over (and LYAO every time you do) as there's are so many underlining statements, stuff Philomena says en passant, that make this show even more amazing.

Four, Ali G (Sacha Baron Cohen) started the fake interview stint done by a supposedly dimwit guy, but Philomena takes it to the next level. Ali G's guests didn't have a clue who he was and were genuinely stunned by his questions, but most, if not all of Philomena's guests are willing participants, contributing to the hillariousness of the show.

All in all, this is great fun for the years to come, and whilst it may not be in the same league as Monty Python (nothing is) it certainly is closer to it than many."
Cunk on Earth,"The usual comedy genius from Morgan, Brooker and Co.","How I'd missed good satire. It's becoming increasingly harder to write nowadays when the world is more surreal, but this is satirical commentary at it's finest.

Fan-favourite character, Philomena Cunk, is back to navigate the documentary series tropes expertly, with Dianne Morgan adding her usual comedic blend of dry satire, irony and faux stupidity - so well, in fact, that people such as 'b4blue' appear to have completely mistaken exactly what it is that the show pokes fun at alongside being surreally funny (spoiler, it's not solely 'experts that think they're always right').

Brilliant, top-form writing from Hazeley that's on par with his plethora of previous work. The usual contributors combined with a laugh-out-loud performance from Morgan make for a wonderful satire."
Cunk on Earth,A Timeless Mystery,"""Insanity has limits but stupidity has none"", Elbert Hubbard

My favourite Open Univeristy educational presenter brings us more wisdom from the ages. More of the great programming coming from the UK's BBC, which means good writing, production, and expertly delivered by one of my favourite performers, Diane Morgan. She such a distinguished dead pan delivery that i believe is now cornerstone of her acting skillset. And some of the contributors and experts leave me in stitches, especially the ones who don't really know or heard of Cunk, but the longer Cunk is on the prowl, the more awareness of the parody become clear. Most of the experts know what is going on by now. And fair play to the writers and shows creator Charlie Brooker for still surprising the experts with their intriguing questions.

If you have only come across this show, and get a giggle from this type of humour, I highly recommend going and watching the other TV shows ""Cunk On ...""."

Cunk on Earth,"Fresh humour, sarcasm & absurdity. Not for everyone","It's the first time I watch a mockumentary, and the first time I see the character of Philomena Cunk. I love sarcasm and it's been a while since I've seen something this funny!

Within the first minute of the first episode, her humour sets the tone brilliantly! You obviously have to play the game with unexpected questions and far-off conclusions. Yet, in all the fakeness, you can find a gem of satire on all topics.

Although you won't learn much, as some would use that to undermine the series, I think that's the point of a mock...

Some have said it's meaningless, so If I would ask myself why this piece of work exist, beyond just jokes, i think the art of satire and the absurdity genre are great ways to bring important questions about our current world. I think That's why many people have enjoyed this show, and sarcasm in general. All this grand talk about civilization was brought in a mockery to reflect on our current era and the relevance of history.

This series had great lines overall, even if I found a few just weird.

Some experts reacted brilliantly as well. They had to take the host as seriously as possible.

What could have been better: I wish there were more episodes, and I would have hoped for a less western-centered focus... although they do criticize this themeselves.

I wish the experts had time to talk a bit more , but it showed that it was really not the point of series !"
Cunk on Earth,Hyper-ironic,"The ostensible joke is on the academics, but one of Charlie Brooker's older characters was called ''opinion-haver''; that is a nobody without education whose committed views only skewered themselves, not they knew it. Morgan/Cunk plays this trope brilliantly while the clever talking heads who signed up to this series would be in on the joke.

That leaves the object of the series the unwitting viewer, the person who is not well educated, lacks curiosity and lives in narrow, parochial world, also without of any historical sense so they see everything anachronistically - they judge everything by current mores and is therefore ignorance incarnate. The butt of the joke are the opinion-havers, of social media, of tabloid TV and talk back radio, who last read a book at school - and cribbed it - whose cultural compass is set by pabulum and pop music awards.

The early episodes are best while into the modern era it races through and lacks enough good material to keep the level of jokes going. The anachronistic conceit also plays better with the distant past too as references to technology are more absurd and highlight the ignorance being ridiculed."
Cunk on Earth,Intelligent Comedy in the Ali G Style,"A look at human history through the eyes and by guided tour of the main character, Philomena Cunk. This irreverent and ambitious comedic docu-series is actually very funny. Diane Morgan, who plays the lead character with precision and acuity, is channelling Sasha Baron Cohen's, Ali G, as she interviews real historical scholars and puts on her best game face. Many of these scenes are actually painful and cringeworthy, in the Ali G style, and very funny. I do like the fact that Cunk does actually use real history and scenic, historic places to tell the story. I love how the scholars, who take themselves very seriously, are trying to figure out what is going on and still get their points across in an intelligible fashion. I have to imagine there was a ton of footage that is unusable due to people marching off and refusing permission to use the clips. Worth watching. Very digestible in the 30 minute segments."
Cunk on Earth,Silly parody of pretentious history docs,"I do agree with another reviewer that this is somewhat of a Baron-Cohen ripoff (minus the misogynst rant about female comics) in that the interviewer feigns ignorance of the subject to get unusual responses and reactions from the ""experts."" However, if you like history or historical documentaries, but hate the pretentiousness of some of those shows, you will likely enjoy this. I chuckled quite a bit and found the series an enjoyable way to pass some time. No you won't really learn anything new, this is pretty much History 101, and yes, it's not a particularly original comedic set up but it is enjoyable and worth the watch. The humor is silly and at times crudely funny, but it is funny."
Cunk on Earth,Heed the advice of Kirk Lazarus,"There are some funny moments in the narrative portions of the series, but as others have pointed out, it gets repetitive fast after the first episode.

The interviews are, for the most part, painfully difficult to watch. Many are comparing this to Ali G, but Cunk appears not to understand the formula that made Ali G so good.

First, his best interviews were with politicians and otherwise powerful people who the audience enjoys seeing humiliated. As the germans call it, schadenfreude. Cunks' subjects are mostly academics and historians who seem to genuinely care about their work. Watching them stare blankly at Cunk after she says something outrageous just made me feel bad for them, like this was a waste of their time. Punching up is funny, punching down is pathetic.

Second, Ali G's stupidity, while extreme, made sense in terms of his character. Cunk's Colbert-esque portrayal of an arrogant, close-minded, euro-centric buffoon could work, but falls apart when the character is so dumb she doesn't appear to understand the concept of death or doesn't know how to pronounce ""Bible"" or just starts talking about anal bleaching for no reason. Half the time, she isn't even asking her experts questions, just making statements at them while they sit in silent confusion.

There was potential here, and some good laughs scattered throughout, but the interviews are a failure."

Cunk on Earth,Hilarious and worth the time,"What an incredible series. I have not laughed like this watching a comedy show in a long time. Bwhaha...if you are a fan of history and have any clue as to the subjects Cunk is talking about, you will bust a gut laughing so hard. And even if you don't, it's still fun. Cunk is incredibly adept and professional...her deadpan schtick is spot on. And what's even better are her chosen interviewees who are either the most incredible experts become actors I've ever seen or seriously unaware of how ridiculous she actually is. Some of their expressions had me rolling on the floor with laughter. This is fantastic. I love it. I quite literally laughed out loud so many times throughout the series. Give me more! Definitely a worthy watch!"
Cunk on Earth,A bit of information with a ton of comedy,"As a mockumentary series about human civilization, it's very funny, even if it's quite one-note. It reminds me ""Idiot Abroad"" for some reason very much.

Using humor quite similar to ""Borat"" movies, it tells condensed version of human history and main laugh is putting various experts into uncomfortable situation where they have to answer stupid questions about history.

Diane Morgan is very good, too, multiplying comedy with her facial expressions and always having something surprising ready around the corner.

I quite enjoyed it, although given how little average people actually know or have interest in humanity's tale, it's a bit cringey to reduce much-needed education to such a circus.

The comedy method this show did can be highly hit or miss, and for most episodes, they did hit. So worth a watch."
Cunk on Earth,I haven't laughed out loud so much in years,Comentario no disponible
Cunk on Earth,Painfully Hilarious,"This show doesn't treat the audience like idiots, it establishes that most of what she says isn't true and then continues on with the comedic filler in between genuine facts.

Even if the facts are delivered in ironically or are just straight up wrong you quickly learn understand that most obvious yes or no remarks are the opposite of what she confidently states as fact due to being downright ludicrous.

They question genuine professors and with increasingly bizarre questions and face them against insane conspiracy theories supported by straight up lies which one can clearly see their insanity through the blank confused expression of the professors unsure how to respond.

The only gripe I had with the show was the constantly running Danish Pop song joke, it wasn't funny the first time and it was far far less funny by the sixth episode. Genuinely made me sigh with frustration every time that it came up, it turned a 10star show into a begrudging nine star.

Although I would definitely recommend this, it's hilarious and somehow informative even at a very basic level. But prepare to skip the hit Danish song every single episode, honestly the only major gripe I have with this show."
Cunk on Earth,Cunk Up the Jam,"It was weird seeing Cunk getting international attention after this debuted in late 2022, because this is essentially the same schtick from the BBC days without much difference, it's a solid formula though and winningly foolish throughout. The fake interview format on which it's all glued together with is variable and the success of it depends less on the parade of baffled experts and more Morgan's hypnotically unflappable improv skills. The running joke for some reason is both always surprising and always funny. It's not the most edifying format for spoofing in the 2020s but the team have this bit nailed down."
Cunk on Earth,Brilliant,"This is absolutely brilliant. The underplayed yet overexaggerated satire is on point.

And there is actual history in this (if you know your basics).

And this is not some ""gotcha"" interviews. She has been doing Cunk for years, so the experts know exactly what this is, which somehow makes it even funnier. How the experts are able to both play along, while still being startled is comedic gold.

I think maybe this type of satire is harder to laugh at or really appreciate if you are from a culture or part of the world where satire is more (or too much) overdone and flamboyant, rather than this type of subtle-yet-not form. Brilliant."
Cunk on Earth,A Very Mixed Bag,"I appreciate what the series has tried to do. In some ways, it succeeds. In others, it falls uncomfortably flat.

The historical narratives are the best part of the series by far, and there were some very amusing lines poking fun our species' self-destructive tendencies. I especially loved the spot-on comments about America.

But the interviews of ""experts"" were cringeworthy and painful. Frankly, I was impressed at how well the interviewees handled the attempts to humiliate them, presuming the interviews weren't scripted. They didn't seem to be. Cruk's questions and comments were so inane and juvenile, the guests couldn't respond in any humorous or meaningful way, squandering opportunities for humorous interplay. What was left were one-sided displays of indulgent self-centeredness by Cunk. Had they minimized these painful interludes, I would have given the series a much higher score. If the group behind this project reunites in the future, they need to reduce or eliminate the interviews all together, or better yet, clever up the writing so the interviewees can actually participate in the fun."
Cunk on Earth,Just trying too hard,"It's not original, the concept has been done a million times. Think Borat, but not nearly as funny. Tries to be a mix between Borat and an Idiot Abroad, both which are brilliant, with actual ""history"" thrown in here and there.

The concept is simple: Act like an idiot asking people in the ""know"" dumb and ""out there"" question about real history.

There were a couple of funny lines in the first episode, but it was the same thing over and over. E.g. Ask a Roman historian his opinion on whether Romans ""invented"" or ""perfected"" something.... ""Roads"", ""writing"", ""anal bleaching"". Hilarious... no, not really."
Cunk on Earth,enjoyed it a lot,"I don't think there was a line where I did not laugh because of this. About 5 minutes in the first episode and Philomena already had me spitting out my drink. It is actually my first time watching Diane Morgan and I can't believe what I've been missing out all this time. Her deadpan acting and ignorance is what makes this so witty. Also kudos to the experts for being cool about this and agreeing to be on this one knowing they're only going to be asked stupid questions.

What more can I say, this brutally honest mockumentary is just what I needed to get a good laugh. I do hope there's more like this soon."

Cunk on Earth,The only complaint I have is there are only 5 episodes.,"There'll be polarized opinions on this one - some will love it, while others will detest. I first saw clips of this show on social media. And it just got released on Netflix in February.

Philomena Cunk is only superficially interested in anything else other than herself. And has the ability to draw the absolute wrong inference from just about everything. All the experts know it's a mock interview but were asked to take the questions as seriously as they can and treat Cunk like an ignorant child.

With 5 episodes of about 30 minutes each, it would be easy to binge-watch in a single effort if you can keep your sides from splitting. Ample downtime is provided in each episode with a rousing version of Pump up the Jam, the 1989 song by the Belgian band Technotronic. The only complaint I have is there are only 5 episodes. Although I don't know if my heart could handle any more than that."

Qismat,First ever flawless Punjabi movie !,Thank god my cousin told me give it a watch. It's been a week since I saw this movie and I just can't stop thinking about the movie and the characters. This is my second perfect 10 I've ever given to any movie (first one was Scarface). Ammy Virk is the dark horse of the Punjabi industry (what a natural actor!! ) and the innocence portrayed by Sargun is just fantastic. I don't usually see a lot of Punjabi movies but by far this is the best one I've seen moreover I think I'd be wrong if I restrict this movie for a regional movie. I think this movie should be dubbed in every language and should be shown everywhere in the world. Kudos to the actors and directors and the whole crew for coming up with such an amazing project!
Qismat,Impact,Overall movie was pretty nice . A must watch movie. After so much time a sad romantic movie came up and really appreciate the efforts of the lead actors. At the end movie leaves an impact on you .😊

Qismat,Awesome movie,I couldn't sleep well after watching the movie so I had to watch it twice. You wouldn't want to miss even a single scene of the movie it's that awesome. Every time I listen to the songs of this movie I cry.
Qismat,A Unique Punjabi Movie,"Congratulations to Director and all team

It is an emotional drive. First of its kind for pollywood. Keeps you engaged with plot which you shouldn't miss. Movie has such a different feel to it, it makes you feel heavy on your heart and sad. Definitely not which everyone may like, but who appreciate cinema will definitely find it beautiful. Touch of typical punjabi rural humour. Acting is at best by all characters.

And you will return to home from theatre with moist eyes ."
Qismat,Beautiful love story,I had never seen such a beautiful love story before. This movie completely wins your heart.
Qismat,Best movie ever,"I was surprised to see such a movie What an emotional,comedy and romantic movie Iloved to watch such a movie And want to watch again and again"
Qismat,Awesomely loved,I think after carry on jatta this movie is the best movie for punjabi cinema industry and this movie will break all the record for sure even carry on jatta
Qismat,Amy Virk Failed to show fairness to his role,"It is a unique script, entertaining but Amy virk Simply failed to arouse any excitement. He was simply dull and boring character. He is not screen face anyway but we appreciate he is part of production that entertains Punjabi audiences. All movies viewed so for in which he acted if they are viewed as success his role is least meaningful ""Nikka Jaildar was success because of Kamaljit Anmol and Khera. In this film Sargun Mehta did a great role But for Amy Virk simply disappointed."

Qismat,Punjabi movie in safe hands,One of its kind and will say offset from the punjabi movie stream. I can say this kind of film not made in punjabi movie history and have taken to the same to new heights. Will recommend to all to watch the movie.
Qismat,Clearly people reviewing this have not watched a decent movie before!,"First of all.... SONGS ARE GREAT!

Acting is questionable, expressions are non-existent, every character had a neutral face. Storyline in its entirety is surely a sad one but also the way it was portrayed a very predictable one. Entertaining if you want to pretend to relate and feel sorry for yourself. There is more background music then there is well thought out dialogue.

For everyone saying bring tissues they lied about crying to impress the girl that actually cried.

Better way to spend 2 hours 17 minutes.

Songs are GREAT!!

If you watch this movie in a particular sentimental mood, you will probably like it and maybe cry."
Qismat,You can feel the movie,...the cast has acted so well that the characters gone alive... Beautifully written and directed..the music of the movie made it so good that help the script and direction to go it above the level.. And for the current generation if you really want to feel true love then must watch it...
Qismat,It will take time to get over this movie,"I do not watch punjabi movies but this movie has changed my perception towards punjabi movies. watch it,it is better than any bollywood movies coming out these days..."
Qismat,Are we sure 90% of the reviews here come from independent sources?,"Grammatically speaking, they come from the same 'voice. Most of the reviews seem to make identical errors in grammar, repeatedly, and share a similar overall structure. Even their lengths seem unnaturally uniform."
Qismat,Awesome movie benchmark in Punjabi movie industry,Awesome movie incredible work by all Punjabi movie industry need this type of stories and movies with different concept.
Qismat,Tearjerker,Ammy Wirk nailed it ! One of the best punjabi movies. Punjab cinema is grooming to another level. Sargun Mehta was too good. Carry tissue boxes with you.
Qismat,About time a Punjabi Film took this route,Absolutely wonderful movie from start to finish. All songs are amazings and will have you listening for years. The ending is unexpected from Punjabi cinemas but what is needed and completes the film. The film is timeless.
Qismat,Must watch,"Amazing story, so emotional .grab your tissues definitely.. its tearjerker."

Transformers: Cyberverse,A reboot done right!,"Let's face the ugly truth A lot of our favorite cartoons haven't been done justice within recent years. The people behind these lackluster revivals often don't respect the original source material which leads to utter disappointment. However against all odds we may finally have a great reimagining on our hands! Transformers Cyberverse offers everything you could want out of a reboot such as quality animation, writing, and character development. Even though glaring flaws are present you can really sense actual effort being put fourth here."
Transformers: Cyberverse,Pretty good,"I've seen some fans be a little to over critical of The last transformers series which was Transformers in Disguise but I think fans are taking more of like to this one, Even with the shorter run-time and character models that look a little like MMD, the show is engaging and fun, I find a little weird that Cartoon Network still has the last transformer show still on their website, which you can still watch. I can get it for the Teen Titans but with the Transformers you'd probably want to bring attention to the current toy line for sales."
Transformers: Cyberverse,One of the best in the series,"I've been the biggest transformers fan since I was little yet I've been able to notice and point out the series flaws. I've hated the bay films and I've only thought that transformers prime, beast wars and animated were the only great shows and g1 being fine and the rest garbage. This series finally gives us another very well done entry in to the series not in the greats but from these first six episodes especially this last one it's definitely a good entry into the series"
Transformers: Cyberverse,Not perfect but it is definitely better than Teen Titans Go! and the Ben 10 reboot,"I have watched around 5 episodes of this series yesterday and I have to say this is actually a good reboot and an 11 minute format done right. Unlike lets say Teen Titans Go!, Powerpuff Girls or even Ben 10 2016 there is still action involved in the series and the humour while it can be childish it definitely isn't forced or just over dramatic.

The new concept for this show is more enjoyable and a lot better than Transformers Animated, Transformers Rescue bots and Transformers Robots in disguise (2015). While this show is no Transformers Prime but I will take it nicely.

Animation wise it is okay, might take some time getting used to.

Voice acting wise while the current voice actors are not Peter Cullens or Frank Welker but they will still do nicely.

Overall not a bad show and definitely one of the better cartoon network reboots of 2018."

Transformers: Cyberverse,A Blessing to my Spark.,"There's not much to write about this series. This series revived transformers show excitiment after the sh##ty ""robots in disguise"" series (comics were better) killed it. It brings back many G1 designs, bring back Bumblebee's voice too (after not speaking for like a decade) and doesn't have much screentime on humans, in fact the entire screentime is used for the Transformers themselves and the emotional conflict. Even Optimus Prime is just like his G1 coounterpart (in a good way). The series has a simple storyline to follow for each season: Season one - Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, while Bee and Windblade try to get former's memories back. Season two - The Allspark is found, the war between it begins, Starscream takes over. (Don't know about season three)

Overall, the series are worth few hours to watch and does bring that feel of nostalgia (G1 designs and characteristics) while also having action and emotional balance.

Like I wrote, a Blessing to my Spark."
Transformers: Cyberverse,Is alright,The show is alright if you're a new transformers fan watch this the show is kinda enjoyable but the show doesn't feel right like character doesn't get much screen time like minor character only get like 5 minute screen time and die later.
Transformers: Cyberverse,Better than Transformers Prime,"First off this show is made for people with short attention span, it's only 10min long per episode. But the acting and story are compelling. You can catch season one on Netflix and the 2 following seasons on Hasbro's official YouTube Transformers channel. It's one of the few shows that just focuses on the transformers instead of wasting time on human characters."
Transformers: Cyberverse,Too childish for my taste and annoying,"It's alright. I personally find Optimus annoying in this show. Every time I hear Optimus's voice just annoys me. I'm not saying that the voice actor is bad. I just don't really like Optimus's voice. I really don't like how they replaced Peter Collin for Optimus Prime. I usually like childish stuff but this, this is much too childish for my taste. I found bumblebee okay (the character). The jokes just don't work for me. They just feel so random and stupid. The dialogue is too cheesy for my taste. The auto bots I find kinda dumb in a way. Maybe that's just me. Megatron I find bland and uninteresting. Star Scream is off for me. I really like the animation and art style a lot. I like most of the cast except for Optimus. TFP Megatron is MUCH and I mean MUCH better in my opinion, I mean how can you beat TFP Megatron? But if you like this show, I will respect your opinion."
Transformers: Cyberverse,The Same as Transformers: War For Cybertron: Trilogy,"I can tell this the cheapest Transformers Voice actors, animation, and the dialogue why. First the voice actors in here are very cheap with their roles it's almost they are impersonating the union actors we know in love in the present day 2024 like Abby trott, Peter Cullen, and whatever they are trying to impersonate with unfamiliar voices for each character the more I listen to there voices the more it's like listing to all the characters into one voice actor voicing them all. Secondly, the animation in here is good but they could of made this series an entertainment series to enjoy more. Lastly, dialogue in here is very irritating for the voice actors to listen to since the executive producers found out on the transformers fan website there is one fan saying ""it doesn't matter who voices who, as long they are good voice actors"" VERY BAD IDEA for the fans !!!, I rather listen to my favorite voice actors instead these actors like the actors in Transformers Beast Wars, Armada, Cybertron, Generation 1, & Earthspark series now those voice actors I love to hear !

I'M A FAN OF THE TRANSFORMERS TOO !!!!"
Transformers: Cyberverse,Third season was spectacular,"If they had paced season 1 and 2 properly, it would've been far more bearable. The only saving grace was the shorter episode times.

Season 3 however was absolute captivating and exciting, a proper story and high stakes, interesting fun characters and so much more. It was a joy to finish the show with this season after the torture that was the first two.

Honestly, 9/10 if this show was entirely comprised of only the last season!"
Transformers: Cyberverse,Wasted Potencial,"Transformers Cyberverse has to be one of the worst experiences I've ever had while watching a transformers cartoon. It has some rather cool ideas and concepts that are unfortunately wasted by the hideous 11 minute runtime per episode or the focus on terrible comedy that even a 4 year old would cringe at. Ok let me take a look at the positives 1st. I like the fact that they take a lot of things from a majority of transformers source material like characters worlds etc & and the concepts it introduces are pretty interesting and I hope to see them done right. unfortunately that is all the good things I have to say for this show because this is a real disappointment of a series. The Animation is a mixed bag. if your show is gonna look this basic then why not focus to a more budget friendly 2d style of animation, the character designs look good on that style but in 3d animation it looks wonky and doesn't feel right. The same applies to the action, oh boy the action in this show is awful. something about the action sequences don't feel right. they feel empty like if you watch Transformers Prime or Animated the action feels tense you wonder what is gonna happen or how are the characters getting out of this one. Well you feel none of that in this show and it's especially noticeable on the more action centric episodes. it is short little brawls and clashes with sub par choreography and terrible jokes to ruin the tone of the sequence. The characters are bland. the main characters like Bumblebee and Optimus don't really develop and just stay the same nothing happens to them that makes them question what they are doing or if it's right to do what they are doing. The rest are just there in the background to advertise there terrible toys. many complained that the Bay films have the robot characters as background characters well Cyberverse is just that. It is cool seeing the likes of Skybyte and Rack&Ruin but they don't do anything aside from showing one second of them punching someone into the air or doing a terrible joke. And Lockdown, oh boy lockdown. this has to be the worst character in the last 5 or 10 years. He went from a Badass bounty hunter to a vehicon an idiot only there to serve as fodder. such disrespect to an amazing character that even the Bay films got right. How is that possible?!?!?! it could have been cool if this was lockdown in his younger days and maybe one day he's tired of the decepticon bs and goes at it solo but no he's purpose is just to laugh at how much of an idiot the writers made him to be. And finally the elephant in the room that runtime!!! I know that modern cartoons go for 11 minutes per episode but usually that is excusable because they don't have a main story to follow, but Cyberverse does and it suffers for it. the episodes feel extremely rushed and just end without any real conclusion. It doesn't help that this show has a lot of filler in some of it's episodes and that takes up most of its runtime making the important part of it really thin. Overall Transformers Cyberverse Shows how bad a Modern Transformers Cartoon can be with mediocre animation, bland to terrible and useless characters, comedy that falls flat on it's face, and good concepts that are executed poorly. Some may say that I'm not the target audience for this while part of that may be true, but do not forget that Animated was also aimed for kids and that show had high stakes, good animation, well executed concepts and three dimensional characters that change as the series goes on. which is why I give Cyberverse a 2/10"

Три кота,Russian Peppa,"Imagine Peppa, but made in Russia, and you get this. It has pretty nice stories and cool characters but like Peppa, it needs better animation."
Три кота,Pretty good,The art style doesn't look that good at all but I'll give this show one thing. These writers come up with fresh original plots that Western kids' show writers could only DREAM of.
Три кота,So Funny,I enjoy watching this with my toddler i.hope they come.out with a new season
Три кота,Massive rip off,The makers of this show had better have good lawyers if the Peppa Pig creators come calling....
Три кота,Love it for my kids,"Finally found a great cartoon we all love. It's educational, funny and wenlove watching it as a family."
Три кота,"Show is a dumpster fire, a blatant ripoff of another dumpster fire","Oh lord, where do I begin with this thing?

We'll start off with Candy

She's the worst thing about this

Her so-called ""ideas"" are just doing simple things and BOOM

She's a blatant ripoff of Peppa, I mean, take an image of Peppa and then Candy

The only difference is: Candy is a frickin' cat and not a pig

The next issue I have is the story

It's this: Take a normal thing, make it an adventure, put two ""Me-wow"" sayings in it, give Candy an idea and BOOM, AN EPISODE

My next gripe are the names

Here's an example: ""Mustard""

Tell me WHAT KIND OF A NAME MUSTARD IS

Calling a character ""Mustard"" is like calling Nintendo ""Nin""

My final gripe is everything else

At best, it's a load of old garbage

At worst, it's a cash-grab."
Три кота,Perfect for 1-5 years old,"That series is pretty good for children. It had a calm pace, nice and charm characters and in general, taught kids proper behavior and good things. Also picturing kids' fantasy worlds, as they play.

Animation quality - nice and smooth, but obviously it is not like modern Pixar animations. And it is not needed for babies.

That is my favorite series to put on a big TV in the living room or kitchen because this series will not make me cringe like some other ""kid"" series with terrible characters or plots like Peppa Pig, Rugrats and others. Quite the opposite, Kid-E-Cats is pretty decent to watch in background when you do work let's say in kitchen, and kids are busy watching right here. It has jokes and fun that will find reflection in the hearts of parents because it shows their kids.

And Kid-E-Cats have general educational vibes as it show different aspect of life."
Три кота,"""Peppa Pig Like""","Plots and general art are very similar. But worst. Can anyone tell me if it's something from the same Peppa Pig studio? I read that it is a Russian production (Peppa is British), it seemed to me plagiarism."
Три кота,I really recommend it,"Me and my kid really enjoyed this cartoon, I loved their lines, their humour and all the plot.

But what I have remarked watching these cartoons was a detail in the rooms of the little cats. There were the drawings on the wall!! Niiice idea, inspired from the classics and made with cats.

I kwould like to see them all somewhere altogether.

I saw some of the reviews were pointing out that Kid e cats is inspired by Peppa pig This is another cartoon I love but I cannot share the idea of replicate the scenes from there.

There are many educational cartoons nowadays and this is good, right?

So, my apreciation for the authors! Good job!"
Narcos,,
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,"The drug trafficking, the least of his crimes.","I marathon-watched this vastly ambitious project, watching 3-4 episodes a day. Caracol television aired as many as 113 episodes, although Netflix cut it down to 74. I assume that it's the same amount of film, but without the commercial breaks they could make the episodes longer on Netflix. I hadn't planned to see the whole thing as fast as I did but the fact that I did can only add to the praise I have for it.

In spite of its flaws this is easily the biggest and best production ever from Colombia. It is not perfect, but I have no idea how a perfect show would deal with this material in a coherent and responsible way. These are real people we're talking about, how do you make it entertaining and pay respect to the victims at the same time?

There are several moments where you feel that the show idolizes Escobar, (a rare feeling since family members of his victims were involved in the production) but as his killings and terrorism escalates you feel that it somehow recovers in the end, and makes a more ethical portrayal of the events and the awful damage this monster made on Colombia.

While the show Narcos focuses on the DEA's participation in the manhunt, this show focuses mainly on the efforts of the Colombian Police and Military. But the truth is that this was Colombias ordeal much more than it was USA's. The terror and insecurity. Knowing that anybody who did the right thing, testified against the cartel or disagreed with their actions could easily be eliminated. And that no one could guarantee their safety.

In the end the DEA helped Colombia much more than they helped USA. They came to hunt down a drug-dealer when in reality the trafficking of drugs was the least of his crimes. Colombia was much more hurt by the terrorist, kidnapper and killer Escobar, than the drug trafficker.

Without the threat of extradition this man could've bought, threatened, forced and manipulated his way into becoming the nations leader. There is no way a prison in Colombia could keep this criminal behind bars and isolate him from the Colombian society.

I think the two shows Patron del mal and Narcos complete each other, even if ""Patron"" is infinitely better. Without the success of ""el patron del mal"" they probably wouldn't create ""Narcos"". And without the international success of ""Narcos"" to the English speaking audience, ""el patron"" wouldn't wake up curiosity and reach an audience outside Latin America.

I rate the show highly even if it has a telenovela-feel at times, many great actors, apart from Escobar himself, the portrayals of his family, crew and most known victims such as Galan and Cano.

The casting is excellent most of the time with actors who physically are mirror images of the real people. In the smaller roles and in the action sequences you can see the shows flaws, but it's forgivable.

The shows theme is catchy with tasteful lyrics, once again trying to pay tribute to the victims to compensate any moments of admiration it may have shown to this Criminal.

All in all the soundtrack is good but some songs too repetitive. This show was controversial in Colombia and rightfully so.

However it's highly watchable and recommended."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Way better than the Netflix Narcos version,"When compared with Narcos, the low budget is very visible in the production standards -- but the detailed script overrides the other flaws. Outstanding attempt."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,"Much better than ""Narcos""","In my opinion, ""El Patrón del mal"" is much better than ""Narcos"". More realistic and accurate to real facts. If you are from a Spanish speaking country, or if you are familiar with this language, you will realize that, no doubt.

In ""El Patrón..."" all actors are Colombian; you feel like you are there with them, at the times and places the events are happening. The main actor, Andrés Parra, really looks like Pablo here, talks like him, moves like him... And this is also the case with most of the other main characters (even if the names are changed sometimes, for instance Carlos Lehder is here ""Marcos Herber"", and so on).

Some have critized that this series are like a ""telenovela"", but I don´t agree. Maybe the structure is similar, but the main thing in the plot are not the love stories and the romantic misunderstandings of the characters (like it is the case in telenovelas), but the recent Colombian history, seen from different perspectives: Pablo and the Medellín Cartel on one side, and the authorities fighting against crime on the other.

Some have critized that this series glorifies Escobar, but I do not agree with that either. One of the scriptwriters is actually Camilo Cano, a grandson of Guillermo Cano, the director of an important newspaper who was killed by Escobar. And the script is based on a book written by a former mayor of Medellín.

By the way, there´s a book out there about this series written by a fan, it is a guide for the episodes of the series. As far as I know it is only in Spanish for now, but if you speak this language, love this series and/or are interested in the story of Pablo and the Medellín Cartel it could be interesting for you. The book´s name is ""Pablo Escobar: El Patrón del Mal (Guía de todos los episodios)"" and you can find it in Amazon (ebook and paperback)."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Unromanticized epic,"As a fan of all the Narcos series I was happy to see this turn up on my stream, hungry for more of the intrigue and shoot em up action. But I soon realized this take on Escobar was a far cry from those glamorous romanticized versions with their Sopranos-like anti-heros - the main character of this show is an unrepentant scumbag, with more revolting warts than endearing dimples.

The early episodes had me questioning the casting of the lead. The character was a dumpy schlub, too stupid and crass to emerge as a powerful leader. But as the series unfolded the actor proved a superb choice, evolving seamlessly into a canny take-charge capo and eventually a cold-blooded sociopathic tyrant. It's a brilliant performance, of a character with very little charm who nevertheless commands your attention.

While there's plenty of violence throughout, it's rarely the exciting give-and-take gun battles of the Narcos shows, but rather savage murders and bombings aimed at defenseless politicians and journalists and other declared enemies of the Medellin cartel. And there's no clever adversary playing cat and mouse games with Escobar - the personal thorn in his side is his wife, a strong-willed character every bit as conflicted as Carmella Soprano, torn between her conscience and her lifestyle.

At times the series dips a toe into telenovela territory, with maudlin montages as characters reflect on memories of their recently assassinated loved ones, but these are few and far between (and easily zipped through on fast forward, without losing any of the story.)

There is also real news footage, generally of the aftermaths of bombings or assassinations, which is noticeable but works well in the context of the show.

Another big difference from the Narcos shows is the depiction of the Colombian law enforcement and political establishments, with much less focus on the corrupt officials in Escobar's pocket and more on the heroic idealists who opposed him. (Understandable, since some of the producers had personal ties to those opponents.)

Overall, the production values, like the casting, is excellent. The settings and costumes are somewhat more realistic and down-to-earth than those of the Narcos shows, reflecting Escober's lower class tastes.

Warning though, if you get hooked: with several dozen episodes, this will keep you binging for weeks."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Colossal Colombian Cartharsis,"Pablo Escobar: El Patrón del Mal is an ambitious and largely successful undertaking to portray the man who held the country of Colombia in his tyrannical grip (by the proverbial cojones) for more than a decade. The epic series (73 episodes on Netflix) details the damage and heartbreak this man left in his wake. The story of Pablo Escobar is nothing if not unbelievable, and this expansive production manages to explain the seemingly inexplicable, how a single person could essentially take over a country, corrupting countless individuals through the imposition of a ruthless ¨plata o plomo¨ (money or bullets) ultimatum at every stratum of his society.

The series is not perfect--the jarringly repetitive music riffs preceding every single pursuit scene, the sometimes bizarrely abrupt casting changes from one episode to another (the radical transformations of the wife, Paty, and the son, Emilio, were especially puzzling), and the excessive, overwrought sentimentality in the aftermath of some of the atrocities can all be criticized with good reason.

That said, the overall production is a success because the acting is very, very good, and the writers and director accomplished what they set out to do: to tell a story which needed to be told, and to do so convincingly, complete with historical film clips inserted where available to document that this is not a tale of fantasy. The series was so gripping that I watched six episodes a night continuously until I finished, exhausted by the ordeal.

I was especially impressed by the ability of the lead actor (Andrés Parra) to portray how it was that Escobar was both loved and feared to such an extent. His rise, fall and ultimate unraveling were very well paced, and the acting was perfect. Other standout performances were those of El Chile, El Topo, Fabio, Marino, Pedro Motoa, El Mariachi, Marcos Herbert, Gonzalo, Cain, Kiki... the list goes on and on.

I highly recommend this series to anyone with an interest in the history of Colombia, the cocaine trade, or organized crime more generally. All of the dialogue is in very clearly articulated Spanish, so it is linguistically worthwhile for anyone who speaks Spanish as a second language. (There are subtitles in various languages, too, so the production is accessible to non-Spanish speakers as well.) Anyone who is interested in the nature of corruption should not miss this series."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,The best adaptation I have seen!,"This was an interestingly informative series. Unlike the new Narcos show, this show gave us a complete insight of how Pablo became the terror he was.

In my opinion Narcos has to get better with their storyline, as it is not as thorough as the Pablo el Patron series. Maybe because they telling it from the Narcs perspective and even though it is a good show, I feel like it is still lacking some pertinent information.

Pablo el Patron took me by surprise and held me tight until the very end of the series and now I feel like I need more but the story came to an end in the right way. LOVED IT!!!!!!! I hate it took me 4 years to see it."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Best Latin American Series Ever,"Superb. I haven't enjoyed a TV show this much since Breaking Bad. If you speak Spanish, you will enjoy Colombian from different provinces which is a delight. Escobar role is phenomenal. The sicarios are so believable and scary but hilarious at the same time! Angie Cepeda is a bonus. She is so hot is not even funny (or it may be I can't get the image of her naked in ""Pantaleon y sus visitadoras"".

If I have to criticize something: 50 episodes would have been more than enough.

Another great thing about this series is that you get to see a lot of Colombia. Especially Medellin and Bogota and the beautiful Colombians which are a pleasure to listen to. Spanish is my native tongue (I am Argentinean) and I believe Colombians have the most beautiful and richest Spanish. .

Amazing! I highly recommend it."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,The real,I really didn't expect this series to be as good as it is. It was one of those shows you find on Netflix hoping to like but fully expecting to turn off ten minutes in. I was thoroughly surprised to enjoy it as much as I did and found myself sinking into the deepest of binge holes. From what I understand this show was made in Colombia and created by individuals who's lives were personally impacted by Pablo Escobar. Because of that they must have felt a responsibility to make it true to life while trying to represent their country in the storytelling. This show has heart. There are times when it seems a little melancholy after something awful happens but these terrible things happened to them and they deeply traumatized the country. As an American I see this in anything that portrays the terrorist attacks of 9/11 so as a viewer I understand they're trying to reflect the sorrow the nation felt. The acting is just excellent. After the first episode they switch some characters around and at first that bumped me but after seeing more I can't imagine the story being told with any other actors. I don't imagine they had a huge budget and some of the explosions aren't shown but the production value is tremendous. On par with most current television shows. If you are fascinated with the Pablo Escobar story and wish to get an angle that isn't quite as glossy or glamorized then check this out. There are enough episodes to scratch that itch while telling a complete story that never gets old or feels tiresome.
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Andres Parra is My New Favorite Actor!,"I loved Narcos but I am over the moon for Escobar, El patron del Mal & I simply adore Andrés Parra! 😍(I also love all of Pablo's sidekicks, namely, Marino, Pedro Motoa, Mariachi, Chile, Fabio, Pablo's mother, Cousin Gonzalo, Paluche & Pablo's wife, Paty!) But, Andrés is my new favorite actor! I've searched Tivo, Netflix, Amazon & Hulu to find any show or movie that he might be in, no matter how small a role! I'm now on my second viewing of Escobar, El patron del Mal! I have absolutely no problem with the subtitles & my high school Spanish has improved tenfold! The best acting I've ever seen in my life was when Pablo discovered that his family was in the Monaco building when it was bombed! Andrés' acting was as good as anything I've seen in the Godfather or any other all time great movie, bar none!"
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Informative but not thrilling - and too long,"Narcos made me curious about the 'real' Escobar story. So I sat through all 74 episodes of El Patrón del Mal. From a Colombian perspective, the production might be acceptable and the story-line fascinating. Now I'm just a movie watcher so without disrespect to the victims I review this series as such.

1. It's far too long. Too much time is spent on victims and their funerals, on journalists, on mourning family members. (My mam recently died so the impact of a death is still fresh in my memory. How unbearable it may be, filming crying people doesn't make for a good TV-show. No disrespect intended.)

2. Did the journalists help writing the script? They emphasize their own role in a way that's hard to believe. Their meetings are lengthy, boring and hold up the progression of the story-line. Even their home situations and discussions at the dinner table are shown... Admittedly at some point I started skipping the journalists conversations and I never missed a bit of information because of it.

3. Many, many dialogues are simply illustrations of what we already know. People worrying, politicians worrying, journalists worrying, possible victims worrying, before a murder, after a murder, yes, at a certain point we got that the situation was bad. Some of these sidelines, like zooming in on murdered politicians and their families, consume up entire episodes.

4. The music is badly chosen and sounds like some free stock sound-samples used over and over again. CGI (explosions) aren't state-of-the-art either, to put it friendly, but somehow I find that easy to forgive.

5. Location indicators: before seeing a scene, we're informed where it takes place by a panorama picture of the city. The same picture of Medellin (or Bogota) with the same clouds in the air, over and over again. OK, sometimes the night shot is used.

6. What really puzzled me was the casting of Escobar. Looking at this series, Escobar was a fatso, walking around like a Teletubby, so insecure that he never looks anybody in the eye when speaking. His voice has a robotic, mechanic intonation, like he's summing up his lines. It's amazing that such a loser could ever become the worlds biggest drug-lord.

Escobar's character doesn't fit the impression that I got from real footage and pictures: a charismatic guy, gesturing, leading the pack, looking straight in the camera.

But then, everyone says this series is quite authentic so I'll have to accept this disturbing fact as being close to the truth. It spoiled my watching experience to some extent. If they only could have given Escobar some charisma.

I don't regret watching all episodes though. The series was not only informative about Escobar but also gives a peek into a world where lives don't count."

Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Wanted to like it. Watchable ish,"If you have a lot of time on your hands. A lot, then this might fill a void. But if you compare this to Narcos or even better, Gomorrah. Night and day.

If you do decide to watch this. Watch it before the above mentioned, otherwise you will the enormous chasm between these. Not the worst of its type but mediocre in comparison to Narcos (the best version of Escobar story) and other brilliant box sets like Gomorrah (the best bar none), Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Boardwalk Empire, Peaky Blinders etc"
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Not made for the Hollywood/action fans,"As a Colombian, this is one of the best adaptations of the events during that dark time in Colombia, according to Popeye ( one of Escobar's hitman) Andres Parra ( the actor who plays Escobar) was so convincing that he said that it sounds, walk and acted like the real Escobar. This series is meant to show the pain of the victims, their suffering, the widows, orphans and all the people that suffered the insanity of one individual, unlike other Hollywood like productions where the glorify these criminals and made them look like they were heros or something cool to look up to. This might be the reason why some ignorant people might find it boring and not ""enough action' If you really want to know the details and dark consequences of Escobar, his associates and rivals this is the right series for you"
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Gripping but requires patience and humour,"This is a l..o..n..g series but one you can't stop watching once you've started. A low by blow, almost day by day account it feels like, of Pablo Escobar's life, his friendships, marriage and family life, his psychopathy, complex narcissistic personality, the sheer brutality of him and his gang. Dismissing massive bombings of suburbs, passenger plane and indiscriminate massacres of thousands of innocent Columbians as a way to fight the government, contrasts with being a man who cries when his murderous friends and gang members are killed by the government forces.

This is the first Colombian film series I've ever watched. You need to get used to its style. Part documentary, part drama, in parts it feels like part-soap, with sentimental segments (when Pablo's gang kills someone important) accompanied by heart-rending music. And a bit of rocky music in minor chords played in every tense scene leading to some action. But despite these quirks, you get used to this and it kinda grows on you.

Oh and the subtitles. Another source of entertainment. Whoever did the subtitles kinda knows how to translate into English. Probably learned in school. They are a constant source of some confusion and a lot of laughter, never being quite on the mark. But again, you get used to it and it all adds to being a fantastic piece of entertainment and education about this brutal part of modern Colombian history."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Addictive,"It just caught my attention recently and now I am addicted to it. Though I have to read the sub-titles, still no complaints. It shows in depth details of life of a foolish man, building wrong karma throughout. All characters look and act so naturally that I feel I am watching them live. A must watch for crime thriller lovers.."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Picture of the Man as He Was,"While the production seems a bit cheezie on some levels (the seventies teevee serials music for example) it is easy to learn to ignore that and get sucked in hard with the exceptional acting and real-life drama.

The complexity of the criminal characters in this drama illustrate how easy it is for people to trust and become loyal to such psychopaths in real life.

The portrayal of Pablo -- an average looking and in mid-life overweight man who does not fit into any of the stereotypical movie portrayals of the gangster/bad guy is honest and fantastic. Same with the actors who portray his wife and others -- one reviewer commented that his wife could have more attractive for the show. C'mon! She was average, just like all the rest. Its when actresses and actors are chosen for their looks that exceed that of any people in real life that a show or movie becomes unbelievable and bad.

The cold, calculated way in which Pablo uses others to do his dirty work most of the time, and how its not for sadistic pleasure but more for simply power and like a any narcissistic psychopath, people are just to be used and disposed of when in the way - save for his family and yet he controls everyone, even his family tightly and masterfully because that is the all encompassing focus of a typical narcissistic psychopath.

The show is well done and binge watching should be expected as it is nearly impossible to predict what will happen next as none of this follows a writer's script, but instead, the intense and irrational machinations of a madman and his lackeys.

No doubt Columbia is still recovering from the near complete hijacking of their country and the brutal assassinations of innocents, but the US would do well to take heed to the lessons of how the rich and powerful can and will usurp democracy when it serves their interests."

Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,One of the best series made in Latin America.,"All episodes are a work of art. None has no fillers, it always follows the story of the most dangerous and clever drug dealer in the world. Pablo Escobar is an excellent series with a very good humor and I recommend it. 9/10."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Greatest cartel series ive ever watched,This is by far the greatest cartel series in history. The actors down to the plot with the variety of stories... nothing gets better then this. Straight up this is the next for cinema i dont think anything will come close to this for decades to come. I binge watched this everyday and never once was i bored i really want to watch it again it was so good lol. I wish these actors would go and make another one i fell in love with each character these guys really put the pedal to the medal and showed us what the criminal side of life was about when it came to Colombians and different organizations.
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Cultural Conflict?,"After watching 15 episodes of ""Pablo Escobar: El Patron Del Mal,"" I'm done. I've had enough. No mas.

However, I'm not writing this review to wholly condemn the series. I'll admit, no one forced me to sit through 15 episodes. Also, I recently watched the series ""Narcos"" as well as a documentary on the subject so I've simply had my fill of Pablo Escobar. Had this been my first exposure to Escobar, I'd probably still be watching.

Unfortunately, the series suffers from flaws which would have turned me off regardless of my knowledge of the subject matter. The most notable problem is the casting of Andres Parra as the lead. Parra constantly looks awkward and embarrassed. Pablo Escobar must be rolling in his grave; never in a million years could he have risen to power had he carried himself like Parra. Parra's version of Escobar also conflicts with the portrayal of Escobar as a young man. The actor who played the younger Escobar was charming, confident and reasonably handsome. It's difficult to believe that Parra and his younger counterpart--who can't be separated by more than seven or eight years--are the same character. Parra also speaks in a monotone as if he is too focused on the cue cards. Escobar was driven by his emotions. Parra's acting is devoid of emotion. It's just a terrible, terrible fit.

The Parra debacle aside, my other complaints are more trifling. At times, the filmmakers spent too much time on fairly insignificant matters. For example, the fallout from Escobar's execution of a prominent public figure is the subject of two entire episodes. Much of that focus was on the widow, who wasn't even a public figure in her own right. Perhaps there is some cultural conflict here. Perhaps the deceased public figure is so beloved in Columbia that two entire episodes were warranted. As an American, I perceived it as overkill.

Lastly, the music/score is cheesy and awful.

""Pablo Escobar: El Patron Del Mal"" is informative and fairly compelling and the acting (exclusive of Parra) is pretty good. It's worth a shot if you want a comprehensive narrative on the life of Pablo Escobar and if you're not a picky cinemaphile like me."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Excellent with just minor flaws,"This is a superb accounting of the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar Gaviria, probably the most lethal criminal ever to live. The acting, especially by Parra, but also by those around him, is excellent. The pacing is very deliberate and you have to be patient as this is a very detailed exposition on Escobar and his times. Well worth the time and effort.

My gripes are several, though minor: the program could have used a bigger budget, and paid a little more attention to historical accuracy when it came to weapons, helicopters, and the money used (the dollar bills, for example, are of an issue that was not around in the 1980's and 90's). I speak fluent Spanish so the sub-titles did not bother me, but they were often wildly inaccurate. The depiction of the Americans is a bit ham-handed, and does not accurately reflect the tremendous assistance that the DEA and the CIA gave Colombia's anti-drug forces. There, of course, was no Dept. of Homeland Security back then, yet the US Embassy seems to be run by that Department.

My biggest gripe was that the producers changed the names of well-known figures. I guess this was so that certain scenes could be fictionalized, but I don't know.

All in all, a great show."
Pablo Escobar: The Drug Lord,Lesson: Making Drugs Illegal Causes More Harm Than the Actual Drugs,"1st, if you've not seen Narcos and Narcos Mexico, suggest giving those a watch first. If not a Netflix subscriber, it's worth a one or two month subscription for these two programs alone.

If Narcos and Narcos Mexico are 9s, Pablo Escobar: El Patron del Mal is a solid 8, or 7 at worst.

Once in a awhile, it gets a tad corny with the Latin sad soap opera music at a funeral,etc...but, that's part of the charm too.

This program doesn't glorify Escobar in any way. Rather, it pants a complex character of a genius Sociopath. His mother comes off as a Machiavellian with ""pragmatic & flexible morals"", who cares more about her son, than for the world, her country, and others.

Side note: Would have been nice if they picked at least a marginally attractive actress to play Mrs. Escobar. She might have ""inner beauty"", but damn, she's rough on the eyes. Fine job on the initial actress who played the teen Mrs. Escobar.

Also, as a non-Spanish speaker who wants to learn some basic Spanish, via osmosis, hearing Colombian Spanish with English sub-titles really helps to pick up more and more conversation in real life here in South Florida, New York, etc."

Thambi,Surprised that the IMDB score for this film is very low,This is one film which leaves you guessing till the end and every guess you make is almost always wrong. That's what makes a good thriller film.
Thambi,Good Movie,"The first half of the movie is so average and gave a feel like below average movie but, after interval block it had totally changed because of the superb twists and turns. Karthi,Sathyaraj and jo had given a decent and beautiful role in this film.One time watchable,book the tickets and go and watch with your family"
Thambi,"Another engaging thriller movie from Jeethu Joseph, which is slightly different from his earlier movies like Drishyam and Memories.","Though the story doesn't move too much up until then interval block, the first half is very much enjoyable with Karthi's humorous mannerisms. The internal block presents a couple of twists which sets the tone for the second half, which is a mix of emotions and twists and is very much engaging. The performances of Karthi, Jyothika and Sathyaraj form the main pillars of the movie along with the brother-sister emotions and the well-executed screenplay. Definitely a worth watch in theatre."
Thambi,Good thrill movie...👍👍,Good movie... twist and thrill ! Feel the Drishyam in the movie.... recommended to watch!!! Rating 7.5 to 8...!
Thambi,The twist and the story saves the movie,"Acting on the part of everyone except for Sathyaraj are mediocre... The music is dull and the background score leaves a lot to be desired. The direction and editing is a bit messy as well and there are gaps and goof-ups that a good writer or director would have corrected... But, the movie works and keeps you engaged purely for its story line .. and when a movie comes under the banner of being a thriller and is able to throw a twist that most people would not have expected, then it surely does succeed to some extent :) Decent watch."
Thambi,Shrisanchith,"Good movie , nice screenplay ,2nd half twist is unexpected, all actors well played with their roles, Karthi jothika well played, my rating 4/5 for this movie, nice cinematography worthy watch in theatre"
Thambi,Unexpectedly good,"I chose Thambi at random on Netflix (orig. Tamil w.Eng subs) not expecting anything much and prepared to switch off if it did not sustain my interest.

Surprisingly Thambi turned out to be quite a good watch with a decent quotient of humorous dialogues, some masala but well choreographed dances and action, literally cliff hanger stunts and a few good twists in the tale. Jyothika for a change was not in an action Jackson role!

Karthi was good as Saravanan the wayward Thambi. Ilavarasu was the perfect Inspector (he was great in Pattam Pole too). Sowcar Janaki made a good crafty Paati!

Some parts are slow which can be easily fast forwarded without losing substance.

The locations especially in the Nilgiris are stunning. The cottage in the estate with the slanting roof where the Inspector meets his end, looks like a fancy bungalow overlooking Emeralde Lake just out of Ooty. Wonder if it is.

The cinematography, sets etc are good.

No spoilers as there are indeed a few twists and turns that need not be revealed to those who havent yet watched the film.

Overall: A good entertainer and thriller."
Thambi,Roller Coaster!,Thrilling roller coaster! Screenplay & BGM plays the major part. Karthi & Sathyaraj - takes the movie to the next level. must watch!
Thambi,Worth watching,The plot and the presentation is very good though the unfolding of the plot is rushed through. Director has ensured to keep the audience engaged and it's worth watching
Thambi,An okayish thriller that could have benefited from better writing! [+48%],"Jeethu Joseph tries hard to retain the vibe of Drishyam/Papanasam in his latest outing, starring Karthi, Jyothika, Sathyaraj, and Nikhila Vimal. The effort is commendable, and Thambi indeed is a 'family thriller', but the thriller dots barely connect and the emotional dots do not connect at all. Yet, what keeps the film afloat are the casting choices and the manner in which Jeethu tries to pull off a rather far-fetched make-believe.

It, however, fails in drawing great connects between the various members in the family, especially between brother and sister. Also, the placement of red-herrings is sometimes too evident in the screenplay. The first half is quite underwhelming with the prodigal son (or just a con-man?) returning to his home after 15 years and adjusting to the newfound surroundings. There are a number of song sequences, a by-the-numbers romantic angle that doesn't add meat to the central storyline, and a subplot that barely reveals character intentions.

Things do get better in the second half, but at one point, you're subjected to fight sequence after fight sequence without any solid improvement in the plot. The murders in Thambi aren't covered up as phenomenally as the one in Drishyam was. And when the big twist comes around, one does tend to feel that the sole purpose of many earlier scenes was only to distract and deceive. The ensemble does a neat-to-serviceable job with their characters, with Sathyaraj the only one standing out. I also enjoyed Sowcar Janaki's presence in the movie.

Thambi is no Papanasam or Parasite, I can tell you that. It's not a difficult film to sit through, but it could have been a lot (I mean A LOT!) better."
Thambi,Director has handled the twistsssss with perfection,Awesom movie. Worth money. Sure entertainer. The thrill begins from Interval and keeps the pace throughout then.
Thambi,Thriller with overtones of sentiments,""" Thambi"" Tamil movie.

Mystery thriller with an extra dose of sentiments.

MLA living with his wife and daughter, searching his son, who had disappeared, 15 years ago. A con man, from Goa, comes into the scene as his son, bringing happiness and brightness in that family.

Story unfolds in first half, mostly as drama genre movie, to take us to an unexpected interval with a chilling suspense. Second half is in tune with thriller, with overtones of sentiments.

Story and screenplay carefully crafted well and director Jeethu Joseph has presented well, yet another thriller. Compared to his previous outings like 'Memories', 'Drishyam' ...this thriller is not that intense.

And these kinda story, we had seen in movies like 'Charithram' 1989 Malayalam, 'Imposter' 2012 English.... So this movie storyline maybe inspired or plagerized from the references.

Camera work is superb to keep the suspense and tension intact.

7 on 10 for this dragging thriller lasting 2 hours and 30 minutes.

Karthi as the con man and Sathyaraj as the MLA, shone well in their respective performances.

Well knitted presentation with unexpected twists and turns to keep the audience, guessing who is hero and villains are.

Safe watch"
Thambi,Not worth watching,Comentario no disponible
Thambi,Overrated action thriller,"Love the plot, but the movie travelled in a very slow phase, or something was really missing. Leads done their best, songs are ok. From 2nd half I see only Kaithi Karthik in face/reaction, etc. no change in make up, reaction, etc. overall a watchable action thriller but worth for 6/10."
Thambi,Good but not excellent,As per our jeethu joseph film this movie also had a huge twist at the conclusion. This twist is not even predicted by anyone while watching this movie but not too much as Papanasam. Comparing to Papanasam this movie is less packaged twist. Worth a watch
Thambi,A decent thriller with twists all around,"An entertainment roller coaster of a thriller story with enough twists and turns till the end. I didn't expect anything from the movie in the name of Karthi or Jothika. Just started watching it as any movie on Netflix... and the movie did well till end. Its just that, unfortunately I read the ""Parental Guidance"" on IMDB before watching the movie which normally I do to watch with my kids, but that had a line of spoiler that made me guess the end twist a little earlier. So, please don't read it if you want to enjoy it through out and yes, there's nothing too much to worry to watch with Kids apart from the regular Indian movie fight violences and song glamours."
Thambi,Great storyline spoiled by songs and fights,"The storyline is great same as his masterpiece drushyam. But songs, fights and traditional way of presenting the story destroyed the greatness of movie.

It seems jeethu joseph back to era of 2010. It could have earn more stars if he did little bit modernization.

Music should be more suspense type.

Anyhow jeethu joseph did his magic at the end with great twist, so you will not disappoint of watching it."
Thambi,Good thriller to watch with your family!!,Thambi is a good family-thriller with great performances by the cast and a well engaging second half..
Thambi,Nice thriller with twists..!!,Good mystery thriller movie..first half goes slow and 2nd half awesome...didnt expect those twists..songs and musics didnt impressed.overall worth to watch without over expections...
Thambi,Didn't meet the expectations,"A pure family drama with almost the same storyline as the director's last installment Drishyam with few changes in it, but on a high level the moral of the story stays the same. Drishyam worked well because it is a pure Malaya movie with casual scenes but Thambi is like mixing up a Malayalam's casual moviemaking with Tamil commercial masala sprayed on top of it which feels like nothing but crap because we've seen all these craps in so many older movies. There could've been some emotional bonding scenes which might've made it work at least for the family audiences but I think they omitted it just to avoid the mocks from the audience since it impacts the baseline of the story which breaks only in the end of the movie."
Thambi,Comedy action thriller,This movie has got a medium rated first half of comedy and romance . Second half is good action thriller. Overall it is a mix of things.
Thambi,Masala Thriller,Comentario no disponible
Thambi,Waste,Totally wasted unworthy movie ever.very boring
Thambi,Family drama with suspense,Again papanasam with a different narration.... first half is slow but comedy scenes worked well.... second half is good with some twists...
Thambi,Brilliant but lacks logic!!,"The plot is pretty old - A fraud protagonist enters a family claiming he is the long lost brother they are looking for. There are lot of twists and turns behind this and keeps you hooked most of the time. Though the plot is racy and unpredictable, it lacks logic after the reveal and it keeps you wondering - ""Why?!?"". It could have been much better flick had some small elements in the narration had been taken care of. A good entertaining watch in Netflix!!"

Welcome to Sudden Death,"Michael Jai White makes it watchable, but this is a below average version of a much better movie.","Jesse Freeman, a former soldier turned stadium security guard who's still readjusting to civilian life, takes his kids to see a basketball game where he works only for a well armed team of mercenaries to take over the arena and only Jesse can save the day.

Welcome to Sudden Death is the latest in a long line of films produced by Universals Direct-to-video studio Universal 1440, a label that specializes in making sequels to moderately successful theatrical releases like Backdraft 2, Inside Man 2, and a glut of Dragonheart sequels just to name a few. In this case Welcome to Sudden Death is a remake of one of the better Jean Claude Van Damme vehicles Sudden Death from 1995 but the movie takes only the bare bones of its inspiration and slaps it on what feels like the tone and humor of Paul Blart.

First the good, Michael Jai White is still charismatic and brings energy to the movie even if the material is beneath him. What fun there is to be had from this movie is because of the charm and physical prowess of white. The hand to hand combat scenes range from mediocre to okay(with the best one being a sequence in a locker room at the tail end of the movie) and despite not being as well staged as superior White vehicles like Blood and Bone or Falcon Rising they do convey some dynamic and forceful fights.

The bad, the movie is obnoxiously silly. It is over stuffed with comic relief characters like Gus the janitor, Jesse's Kids, and a panicky rapper named Milli who all play their roles over the top with broad humor that does not land. Michael Eklund plays the villain code named Alpha and he is not a good villain. His performance feels more like a deranged hillbilly than a criminal mastermind and even taking into account the movie's goofy tone he still doesn't work.

Welcome to Sudden Death is a pointless remake of an okay 90s action movie. While not completely without merit thanks to the usually reliable Michael Jai White your time would be better spent watching similar fare like Final Score or the original Sudden Death.

Edit: for those of you who duck out before the end credits(or the end of the movie for that matter) the movie has the audacity to try to sequel bait with a post credits scene sting.......yeah, that's not happening."

Welcome to Sudden Death,Copy cat,Thought it was a comedy movie then saw that it's just a cheap copy cast version of the original movie with JCVD which was way better. This movie totally sucked.
Welcome to Sudden Death,So bad it's fun!,I knew this was going to be a low budget movie but this is just terrible! The acting is so bad and the story plot is even worst! I wish MJW would be in a good movie for once! Whoever directed this should never ever do another movie agian.
Welcome to Sudden Death,Don't waste your time,Go watch the 1995 Van Damme flick. This is a sorry remake of the earlier version
Welcome to Sudden Death,I mean...wow. Just....wow.,"I like Michael Jai White and enjoy his movies. But his one is bad. I mean, damn. The fight choreography looks like it was done by the kids in this movie. I should've passed on this movie. You should too."
Welcome to Sudden Death,"Oh Michael, oh Michael","Where did it all go wrong for you? Yes I understand that it is very difficult for a cheap movie to get the backing from a major studio but oh boy why did any studio give this the green light? Also why did Michael Jai White sign to do this? sack your agent. Michael is a very talented martial artist and I own quite a few of his movies from the okay, universal soldier: the return to his great movie, blood and bone. This film is way, way down in my estimation, Michael what possesed you make this tripe? I will never know, is he that desperate for money? Another reviewer said that this film was a parody of the first sudden death, ah no it was not meant to be, in fact it was meant to be a serious sequel to it. In fact the van damme vehicle looked like a massive Hollywood blockbuster. Where did this go wrong? Well apart Rom the budget, which we all know about films finding it hard to get backup. Another thing viewers look for in films like this are the fight scenes and this was really bad at it as well. You will always find this in really badly done movies, the moves are done so slowly and loom very amateurish that anybody who has watched a few action movies can do better and just think people get paid for making these dreadful fight scenes. Do yourself a favour and don't watch this, the less people watch this may go and make Michael choose better vehicles to do. Go and watch Security and Acts Of Vengeance, which both made cheaply but are great actioners."
Welcome to Sudden Death,An R rated movie for kids.,Bad. Very bad. I can't believe I sat through his corny low budget waste of time. Thanks Netflix.
Welcome to Sudden Death,Know what you are watching.,"This is a Michael Jai White film, do not expect and exceptional storyline or high quality....well anything. Watch this for its ridiculous nature, and Michael Jai White being over the top and some tongue in cheek action and dialogue that is laughably bad, to the point you can't tell if it's on purpose. Watching drunk is best."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Avoid at all costs......,"Some of the worst acting I've ever seen! Avoid this if you can, I wish I had. I had hoped some of the fight scenes might make up for the acting but......Nope😳"
Welcome to Sudden Death,funniest action movie I have ever seen,I really do not understand the bad ratings This movie was pure fun. It was like a parody of sudden death. It is hilarious. Michael Jai White was great for the role. Even if it is an action film that looks like a parody of an action film it has nice fight scenes and it kept me alert. I did not get bored Why people are hard on this movie? What did they expect to see? Gone with the wind?
Welcome to Sudden Death,I liked this movie a lot.,"Great kid characters, for one thing ;> Lots of humour throughout, for another. Great fight scenes. Explosions! Fine way to spend some time. Filmed in Winnipeg! Bonus :D Bunch of familiar faces, for me. Did I mention explosions? ;>"
Welcome to Sudden Death,Feces just Feces!!!,"I'm speechless! It's a joke! I can't believe Michael Jai White accepted this role! He's awesome, but he must have needed the $ bad."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Nothing to Spoil Here..it is already rotten,"This movie is just plain bad. Characters are stereotyped, the acting is bad and the fight sequences are horrible. The storyline is simple and the script poorly written. Other than Michael Jao White being in it, this movie has nothing to offer."
Welcome to Sudden Death,DOA,"This movie is ""dead on arrival"". A highschool drama club could provide better acting."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Lame with hardly any good fights,"I didn't expect a whole lot, but somehow my expectations were still too high. The dialogue is atrocious and delivered poorly. Some of the characters quip like they know they're in a movie. What few fight sequences there are have been chopped to pieces. The motivations seemed like they existed just for the writer to attempt to make some statement about the military complex.

Only gets two stars because Michael Jai White is awesome. Even though he was clearly phoning it in for this movie."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Wow,Talk about copy cat movie from the original Sudden Death movie! From Jean-Claude Van Damme. This movie was super cheesy super bad.
Welcome to Sudden Death,Is this a joke?,"What did I just watch? Is this a high school project? I've seen better story line, acting, special affects and tension on Saturday morning kids TV.

This is ridiculous. Don't waste your time,unless you're looking for a HowNotToDoIt example."
Welcome to Sudden Death,A fun self aware vibe.,"That's what this action has going for it, it's in no way a great film, but it has fun with it's awfulness. You see it in Michael Jai White's performance, even he knows it's not a good movie, but he has fun with it anyway.







This is a sequel to the Jean Claude Van Damme film from 90's, which I did not see. The stadium scenes are pretty good, the bad guys are cartoonishly over the type. Fight scenes are pretty fun also. Go into this movie not expecting a great film, but just an enjoyably bad action film, you'll just have fun watching."

I'm sorry Guys, it doesn't work like that, you will only to make your lives worse. A decent movie, acting was honest, I like martial arts, so I really enjoyed the fighting, for me Michael J White is very good at, but as I'm not expert, I can't judge anything about. The pace was good, the actions much more than acceptable. Predictable, nothing new? So what? When I watch a movie I want to have some fun and about this movie I don't have anything to complain. If you are used to enjoy even the small things that the life offers you, then you will appreciate this movie as it is, otherwise..."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Dont waste.your time on this,"White, come on. Is it your first movie?. On first scene , waking up showed how bad this acting gonna be. Junk movie, instead they should have spend money for homeless people."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Serious PASS,"The low reviews are spot on. If anyone rated this a 10 out of 10 they deserve to be committed to a mental facility. Some scenes are decent at best but overall it's just really awful acting from almost everyone involved. The lead is a good actor but he's the only one. The dialogue is atrocious and I would only watch this movie if that's your thing and you're into watching bad movies. Otherwise if you do waste your time, prepare to be extremely disappointed."
Welcome to Sudden Death,Unentertaining,There is no aspect of entertainment but a lot of flaws to watch for. There were scenes were Dallas Jackson was smiling despite the scene being a serious one. Many scenes seemed apparently erroneous. Wish the director and crew put some extra effort to make a better movie.
