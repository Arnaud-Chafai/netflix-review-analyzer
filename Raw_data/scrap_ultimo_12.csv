The Knight and the Princess,,
Cleo & Cuquin,Great one <3,This is an excellent program for children. Highly recommended.
Cleo & Cuquin,Very good program for children,For me this show stands out amongst all the bad things netflix has for children. Very very good show for them.

Was It Love?,,
Young Royals,An authentic portrait of a modern royal teen drama,"I really enjoy the plots. Firstly, the actors are in proper age, no over aged actors (not saying they are bad, but just suitable for acting teens). Secondly, the characters are written in flesh and bones as teens, who have flaws and acting irrationally. Thirdly, there is no over dramatic plots but things happen in real life.

The biggest tension is definitely the END of the royal blood vs true love. The ending leaves us a big suspense and we are all pumped to see Season 2!"
Young Royals,Continue watching!,"Saw the first episod earlier this night and wasn't super impressed. Now it's 3.30 am, just finished the last episode and I'm here writing a review and giving this series 10 stars. Needless to say: continue watching !!"
Young Royals,A heartfelt and genuine story,"I loved it, I binged watched it in one sitting. Great storyline that wasn't too slow, but not too fast either. I really loved the chemistry between the two main characters. I would have wanted a little more character development for the side characters, but other than that it was a heartfelt and genuine story that is definitely worth a watch."
Young Royals,Beautiful and touching love story!!,"I loved every single episode of this tv show. It's beautiful to watch how these boy's relationships develops in such complex circumstances. Most importantly, how Wilhelm does his best to balance 'crown x own feelings' and, in spite of any decisions, has a very sweet heart.

Brilliant! Please 2nd season!!"
Young Royals,"a breath of fresh air in a world where even the grass is ""fake""","I have nothing but praise for this show and trust me, i really did try to find the flaws but i just couldn't cause everything thing about this series just fits so well together! The twist of monarchy to this gossip girl/elite like plot did kinda make me think twice but what can i say, i'm sucker for high school dramas! So i gave it shot, and it's safe to say that it did NOT disappoint, and in quite a few places it even beats it's predecessors. From the acting to the writing and storytelling it's all just exceptional and so smooth, you never deal with any kind of sloppiness in it all, and maybe you'd think that with only 6 episodes it wouldn't deliver much of an experience, but you're wrong, it actually does! And WAY more than you'd or even i imagined. The characters are realistic and even when they're doing the wrong thing, they do it rightly! Like nothing in this show ever feels uncalled for, even the 'dreamy' romance feels real! And you really do get to attach with the characters even with the short time limit, and in the end you feel like you're full but you still want so much more of this story as it just leaves with such a huge room for vast developments and connections, so yeah i basically NEED another season! Anyways i HIGHLY recommend it, watch this over the weekend and you'll still be left with more than enough time to watch a whole another series!!"
Young Royals,A great show,"At first when Wilhelm was entering the school I thought ""oh here we go another cringey netflix show with terrible acting and even worse writing"". Boy was I wrong, like any tv show some scenes make me close my eyes and turn my laptop off but this is because August's character is really portrayed well, almost too well. Same goes for all the other actors, you can tell they 100% understood what to do with their characters. I was really prepared to bash this show for being something like Riverdale but god was I wrong and very happy with that! The characters are realistic, the writing well done, the dialogue well thought out (considering most characters are teenage boys and I find writers/directors sometimes forget they don't all talk like English professors.) I can't help but hope this show will be granted a season two!1!!1!"
Young Royals,So good,"So good. Give it a watch, won't be disappointed. Want to see more!"
Young Royals,Heartfelt,I loved this show so much. All the characters are realistically presented. The story moved on the right pace. The two main characters have a really great chemistry. This might be one of my favorite show in 2021. It is better than Elite season 4 for me. The love portrayed felt genuine. I can feel the love through the screen.
Young Royals,A really enjoyable drama,"I'm not someone who usually binge-watches shows, but I did watch this one in one sitting. Really well-written, with so many lovely characters. Even characters I don't like feel real and I could understand their motives. I hope that there is a 2nd season, I was to see more of Wilhelm, Simon, Felice and Sara."
Young Royals,8/10 one of the best Swedish netflix series out there,Comentario no disponible
Young Royals,The definition of perfection: Young Royals,"I didn't expect it to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be this good either. I thought it might be basic and unoriginal, but I was pleasantly surprised!

The story was just beautiful. It's about a prince who has to go to a boarding school, where he falls in love with a boy. He has to chose between love and his obligations. This is well written and touching.

The acting is good too, very good! Especially Edvin Ryding did a really great job. It felt real and it was emotional. The two main characters also have a lot of tension, what makes you get lost in the story and forget about reality for a while.

The characters are not basic or based on characters of other shows, they're their own unique person. They also have realistic behaviour for a teenager.

The whole plot is just realistic and the way they interact is relatable. This is a thing that bothers me a lot in other shows: unrealistic lives of teenagers. So I'm really glad that wasn't the case here.

I don't give a 10 out of 10 very easily, but while writing this review I realised I have nothing to remark about this show. It's perfect and I recommend it to anyone!

Update: the second season is even better!

The plot of Young Royals sounds so incredibly ridiculous. When I started watching the series, I expected something very enjoyable, but also very stupid. I thought it was gonna be like 'Red, White & Royal Blue'. Who the hell even makes stories about a prince falling in love with another boy. Well, these creators did, and I'm glad! The execution was just perfect! It wasn't stupid and ridiculous like I thought it would be. It's not like the other Netflix shows that are focussed more on the costumes and decors than on the actual story. This is so simple, yet so complicated.

Watching the second season I realised even more how good this is. You can see they didn't come up with the second season after finishing the first one, but that the see everything as a whole. I couldn't name one bad thing, everything is amazing!"
Young Royals,Awesome,This show is absolutely great. Not too over the top but also very entertaining. The cast does a good job and the look of the show is quite nice. Let's just hope Netflix doesn't cancel it.
Young Royals,A good drama,The plot was entertaining and good. It was indeed a good drama instead of having LGBT and I'm not hating any part of that. Ending was fine too. Enjoyed it. Go for it .
Young Royals,Why did they bother with season 2,"I LOVED season 1. It was one of my top tv series and I recommended to everyone, the characters, the plot, the cinematography, everything! So amazing. They finished season 1 with such a good ending and it had the potential to have a second season but still wasn't distasteful if they didn't decide to do this. Which they did which I obviously was not mad bad as I loved season 1.

But season 2. Honestly why?????

It was so so so slow paced and every plot I just didn't care about like I did in season 1. The characters were just not the same, the relationships between them did not feel familiar like in season 1 and the main leads didn't seem like they had the same chemistry in my opinion. And the ending? What?

My advice is watch season 1 not 2 as season 1 needs to be watched but season 2 will ruin everything."
Young Royals,Amazing story. Would love to see more!,Comentario no disponible
Young Royals,Incredible,I wholeheartedly recommend it! Is a series that faces many real life problems.
Young Royals,Brilliant and touching!,"I found the series a day before the release date and decided to give it a chance the next day. Definitely the right decision. The plot caught me immediately, as did the characters and their stories. I especially liked the authenticity of Wilhelm; besides his role as a prince, he is also just a normal teenager with problems and struggles.

I really hope there will be a second season. For me personally, the series is one of the best Netflix series ever. Moreover, I hope that it will meet with more approval here in Germany. I would recommend the series especially for people who like Elite or Gossip Girl."
Young Royals,Worth a watch,"All the classic ingredients, but still authentic and really accomplished. I felt like I had watched six episodes when I got to the third because something happens all the time."
Young Royals,Impresive,Comentario no disponible
Young Royals,The chemistry is fire. I'm left with mushiness in my heart and it's been 4 days already 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,Yall please watch this show. The chemistry between the the two leads is soo infectious right from the start. The prince wilhelm (edvin) has done such a fantastic job. His eyes convey soo many emotions. The way he looks at simon with pure unadulterated love is just soooooo .....idk....cute. On the other hand theresthis cutie simon (omar) who's such a lil munchkin throughout the show. He has acted soo well. It didnt feel fake at all. The show is like 100000/10 for me.
Young Royals,THIS IS GOOD!,Love the story . And the end I just want a season 2 !
Young Royals,Wilhelm deserves better,Comentario no disponible
Young Royals,Written beautifully,"The story is written beautifully, all the visual was arranged very well; not perfect but it is fit and match to the story. I watch this on original audio means in Swedish so I'm reading English subtitle to understand it and the details in the visual depicted in this series help to me to understand more. Really engaging story line. I cannot wait for season 2! I know this story can offer us the viewer more."
Young Royals,Season 2,"Maybe they didn't want the spark among fans goes away, but season 2 seems like very rushed to be produced and aured. So many flaws & inconsistency in outfits or scenes. The best part of YR were its music, We don't see that in season2. Plot was alll over the place in the new season.every characterhas somethingto say but none were really fully finished their story. New characters were also introduced but didn't sit right with old characters. Actors/actresses r great but plot/ cinematography/ music r not as good as season 1. I'd rather wait more for a better outcome. I'm interested in seeing another season i know it gas lots to say."
Young Royals,Unrealistic and a bit too sensational,"I really expected high quality, especially because of the incredible high rates, even higher than The Crown, which in my opinion is one of the highest quality series on Netflix. This was far beneath that level. It felt unrealistic, sensational and superficial. Unrealistic because of the scenes, a bit over the top, too loud, too extreme, too unrealistic. The roles or characters were skin deep to me and didn't meet my expectations at all. The story line was not interesting enough and rather predictable and apart from the two main characters, there were there were no other characters worked out. A disappointment."
True: Winter Wishes,Perfection,"Ignore the idiot who posted that negative review based on biased opinions of anime rather than the shows actual worth. True is an incredible show for young girls and it's actually pretty entertaining for the parents stuck watching it 300 times a day like myself. Technically, the animations, modeling, textures and shaders used by their art team are TOP NOTCH. Even for today's standards. I'm a 3D Artist myself so trust me when I say that. The voice acting is impeccable and the writing is actually extremely entertaining a safe for children. I'm easily annoyed with today's media shoving socio politics in kids shows but thankfully this one doesn't do that. It simply teaches kids to be positive, creative and kind. This show is absolutely wonderful and my 2 year old daughter watches it EXCLUSIVELY. By choice. I've seen every episode a dozen times each. So I'd say I'm far more qualified than the other reviewer ""Andrea"". Final Verdict: It's a child-safe show reminiscent of Adventure Time. If you need something to sit your daughter in front of, you can't go wrong with this. It's not bad for boys either. The cat is hilarious. I'm a 37 year old father so if I can enjoy it, anyone can."
True: Winter Wishes,Good for young kids,"Not sure how educational it is, but the first episode had a mini lesson in it about calling names and making people feel bad/lose confidence. My 2.5 and 4.5 year olds were both entertained and music wasn't bad. It was weird though. Very weird."
True: Winter Wishes,2 year old loves it,My 2 year old is obsessed with this show. Helps me get stuff done around the house!
True: Winter Wishes,Teaches kids Careful Thinking and Problem Solving,"This show follows a little girl named True in a world of whimsical characters. Each episode presents a fairly silly problem that is easy for kids to understand. After looking into the problem, she will visit the wishing tree. At the tree she recieves three ""wishes"" that all appear as glowing yellow orbs. True recieves three wishes, each with a specific power such as reflecting light, freezing ice, making dots, inflating or being long and stretchy. The wishes at alive and turn into cute little forms to match their power. The wishes are stored in True's backpack until she need them.

She must then use the wishes to creatively solve the problem. To emphasize this, the characters take meditative poses and take deep breaths before working through the issue. Their is a strong focus on calm reasoning and creatively using the tools you have available to address a problem. Even though True can't control what wishes she recieves, she always manages to use their powers to work through the problem."
True: Winter Wishes,Great show,My 5yo daughter and my soon to be 3yo son love the show. Good messages and bartleby is the best!
True: Winter Wishes,"Beautiful show with zero attitude, refreshing!","We absolutely love this show! I often find that these kids shows have a lot of sass back and attitude and the characters are mean to each other. But to see a show that is so conscious of how they speak to each other and how the characters treat each other is very refreshing.There's nothing mean about the show, everything is good at its core,there's no mean kids! Even the so-called ""villains""of the show are just misunderstood and that is a refreshing Viewpoint to see in children shows. It really is sending the message that everyone is worth your time and energy and some people struggle more than others to make the right choice! we love the show and the music is hilarious and wonderful."
True: Winter Wishes,Too chaotic,"I'm surprised at all these great reviews. My 3 year old daughter watches it sometimes but I don't think she understands most of what's going on. There are so many different characters and creatures and the stories are often very hard to follow I think. The cat talks so fast and is all over the place, very annoying. I think my daughter might enjoy it more when she's like 5 or 6."
True: Winter Wishes,Great for kids,"My 4 year old daughter has been watching this since she was 2. The show is VERY well made, has some nice lessons for children is colourful and silly enough that it keeps kids entertained.

I've got no qualms about letting my daughter watch this show. Kudos to the creators."
True: Winter Wishes,The Worst thing to come out of Netflix,"First of, I really hate this show because it's plots serve no purpose, annoying characters, and ripping off animes like Onegai My Melody. Clearly, they're trying to cash in to compete Sanrio. The only good thing about this show is that the Wishes are like Kirby's copy abilities. Final Verdict: STAY AWAY FROM THIS NETFLIX COPYCAT, YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH ONEGAI MY MELODY, OR ANY OTHER SHOW YOU CAN FIND THAN THIS HUGE PIECE OF TRASH!!!!"
True: Winter Wishes,This show us a life saver,"My 6 month old is very active..... This show is the ONLY show she will sit and watch. The problem with this is I dont see any True rainbow kingdom merchandise , like a doll for my daughter, other than that the show is awesome"
True: Winter Wishes,Great for Kids,"This show teaches good values to your kids, (no immoral characters like most shows) and is actually tolerable enough for parents who view TV with their kids. Both my son and daughter love this show, so it's enjoyable for both girls and boys. Not to mention, the animation is adorable!

Obviously this show is made for kids so I'm not going to critically analyze the plot as if it was going for an academy award. honestly love this show!"
True: Winter Wishes,Good,Very nice. Good series. 10/10. It's very bright and colorful.
True: Winter Wishes,Perfect kids show!,"We absolutely love True! It's perfect for young kids (and my older kids and I actually like it, too)! True and her friends are kind and thoughtful and work together to solve problems that often have a little life lesson to take away. I love how they pause, take a deep breath, and take time to think about the problem before rushing off to solve it. I also love that there are no ""bad guys"". Even the friend, Grizelda, who is a little self-centered and easily could have been ""the mean girl"" is actually a good friend and when she realizes her actions cause problems for others, she does her best to right the situation. No one is mean to another, they are positive and lift each other up, and they are concerned about others' feelings, but not in a sickly, sugary, over-the-top way. It feels very genuine. There are no scary scenes, the creatures are adorable, and the songs are cute. And her cat sidekick, Bartleby, is actually pretty hilarious. He throws some fun/playful sarcasm in there for adults without being negative or rude. The writers do not try to sneak in political agendas or push opinions on viewers, and there are no disguised adult themes/jokes/almost-swearing that has become so popular in kid shows. It's just good, clean, caring, using-your-brain-and-heart fun."
True: Winter Wishes,Enjoyable and cute,"My daughter has watched this since it debuted. As any parent knows, if a kid likes it, they will easily sit there and watch the same thing ad nauseum so it's nice that the production values are good. The stories are easy to follow and her sidekick Bartleby is funny. I also like how they meditate before attempting to solve a problem - it's a nice habit and my kid has used the breathing exercises IRL."
True: Winter Wishes,True Delight,"Brilliant and uplifting in every moment.

Clearly made by people with a deep-seated love of anime: the titular True rides a flying cloud like Dragon Ball's Goku (called ""Cumulo,"" not ""Nimbus""), she has a Sailor Moon-style ""transformation"" sequence, and solves problems by summoning ""wishes"" with hyper-specific abilities and highly limited vocabularies like Pokémon. If there's any doubt, there's even an episode featuring a ""Hinotari"" bird, a clear reference to the Japanese ""hi-no-tori,"" or phoenix. But it all comes off as affection, not cheap pastiche, and it holds the series together so well I'm surprised they haven't marketed it in Japan. Japanese kids would love this.

The show features bubblegum animation in a world where many major features are alive, including mountains, buses and the sea. It focuses on problem-solving with perseverance and positivity, with almost all conflict due to accident, ignorance or a well-meaning mistake -which might be the show's one limitation, since the relentless positivity means nobody is ever really forced to reflect on the consequences of their actions, though True is sometimes challenged to convince characters to give up on their more destructive desires for the sake of harmony in the Rainbow Kingdom.

There's an insistence on stopping to think before diving at a problem, and in every episode, True's first two wishes don't completely resolve the issue at hand - and sometimes actually make it worse - so she has to adapt and think of a creative way to use her third and final wish.

There's no educational value for kids in terms of counting or reading, but the show lays the foundation for an unerringly positive, can-do attitude in the face of adversity, as well as showing that people should be valued even when they do things that unintentionally cause us problems.

The relationship between True and her cat friend Bartleby is absolutely delightful, and the giant purple yetis, who can only talk by screaming, are utterly hilarious. We love watching this over and over with our child."
True: Winter Wishes,Great for young toddlers,All four of my kids love this show and they range from 4 up to 10. They all enjoy it.
True: Winter Wishes,Adorable!,"My 3 year old is obsessed with this show and out of all the Kid shows that I've had to endure, this one is actually enjoyable. Love the cute names and creatures they created. The graphics are adorable and they have some great life lessons in there. Barnaby is my favorite!"
True: Winter Wishes,The most amazing kid's show,"This show is amazing! It is my daughter's favorite show, and I'm so glad because it is so wonderful. If you like to keep screen time limited, but want that time to be quality, this is the show! It teaches valuable lessons for kids and everything about it is beautiful and well done- the animation, the stories, the voices, EVERYTHING. A lot of kid's shows obviously cut corners and have a lower quality than shows for adults but with True that is definitely not the case! There is a lot of hard work and attention to detail here and it shows. Their songs are great too and it is really enjoyable to watch with her. I recommend this show to everyone!"
Unrequited Love,Best chinese series,To me this is the best series that i have watched so far on netflix. The plot was great as well as the actors who portrayed sheng shuainan and lou zhi.
Unrequited Love,🐔Let's Get to Crackin🥚 °good° 💯%🔍,"Sheng turns to say something and LZ isn't there. ""Why are you walking behind me?"" ""I guess I'm used to it,"" our FL replies.

In UL, both of our leads need to come 🐣 out of their shells. Zhu Yan Man Zi (Love Endures, Women Must Be Stronger, The Hypnotist) is our FL, Luo Zhi. She's clever, cerebral, composed, and classy. She's downright chaste, but even moreso, she is candid and considerate. She has enjoyed Sheng Huai Nan (Zhao Shun Ran from Memory Lost & Alliance) and crushing on him, from afar, since HS. Sheng never noticed her - She was always behind him somewhere. He did notice the 🐓 however. When she put on the chicken outfit, she wasn't such a chicken anymore, and she approached him. The presence of a large 🐓 ended up being a great distraction that gave Sheng a leg up in an uncomfortable situation. When he removed the 🐔-head to thank his savior, viola! There's a /girl/ here.

The handsome Sheng, who has had to deflect unwanted advances his whole life, doesn't realize that he DID notice LZ in HS. They were anonymously exchanging notes about schoolwork for a period of time. LZ knew who her pen pal was, but she prefers clandestine operations, so she never revealed her identity. The first year of college was uneventful, but now the 2nd year has started. She un-chickened the 🐥 inside her that one day, and since Sheng lifted that 🐔-head, she's been walking around exposed. Guys are noticing her now, like Sheng's BFF. Hiding is LZ's safety mechanism. LZ prefers the periphery - a 5 meter minimum distance from Sheng; anything else is super-duper uncomfortable. So, when he asks her to accompany him to the amusement park on a group outing, she declines. ""He is a victorious general in the examination field. But on the field of love, he is utterly defeated.""

There's nothing more tantalizing than a club that won't have you as a member. As a professional woman-deflector, being turned down is something new for Sheng. Who is this 🐤? He can't help but be interested...

UL is a 2019 release that is rated 7.8 on MDL. It is 1 season consisting of 24 30-40 minute episodes. It is NOT to be confused with the 2021 release that is of the same name, rated 7.5 on MDL with 38 episodes. {Why do they do that? China put out two versions of Love 020 in the same year. Hollywood has the same problem with overlapping similar projects.} Sheng's BFF, Zhang Ming Rui, is played by Zhang Yi Chi (Rattan). The more he talked, the more I loved his voice. Credit when Gu: Actor, Li Jin Zhe (Zhong Guo Di, The Youth Memories), plays CEO Gu. He exudes sex appeal and it exceeds his mere looks. Part of it is his dreamy voice. This is director Ding Pei's first effort. She has nothing rated under 7.5 on MDL and, given the acuity of UL, I will actively seek out this director's works.

UL2019 is slow and steady. It moves at LZ's pace. Simple, cheerful piano and strings accompany the scenes, making it feel like romance-improv night at the coffee house. There's °slow° that's infuriating or °slow° that's relaxing - and it's widely up to individual taste. UL works because the characters are well formed while the tempo, softly spoken words, and the soundtrack are like a caress. °Slow° works; Slow-and-stupid doesn't, and UL is never stupid. That is the value in this show - The actors are fine. The story is uneventful. The pace is plodding... the value here is in the writing: It is the witty dialogue, the intellectual quotes, & the insightful commentary on humanity that make UL worth a watch.

They end up involved in the drama club and put on a production of Shakespeare's 12th Night. {Apparently, 🇨🇳 is in love with Shakespeare ↪ and Shakespeare's works seem akin to China's historical pieces in many ways.} The translation-of-the-translation is beautiful:

✏ Women are not big-hearted. A woman's love is like a person's taste. It can be tasted on the tip of the tongue but not in the organs. My love is like a hungry sea, which can digest everything. Don't compare them to each other ✏

❣ I know how women love men. One of my sisters fell in love with a man ❣

✏ And what was her past? ✏

❣ It's blank. She never told anyone about her love, and she let depression bottle up inside of her until it destroyed her, ruining her beauty. She pined away. Illness and sorrow tormented her while she waited patiently, smiling despite her sadness. Doesn't that sound like true love? ❣

Thus is their version of 12th Night and, quite obviously, some of the inspiration for the show. Actress, Zhu, is marvelous in the scene. She's acting as a person who pretends to be acting but what she's saying is true, so she's not really acting. Anyway, the acting is great.

Rain Shen (Alliance) plays LZ's roomie, Jiang Bai Li. Each of these girls is getting major interference from the exes of their love interests. The always composed LZ doesn't handle attention, nor interference, well. (""You are too cautious!,"" LZ's mom laments). Hanging around Sheng, the campus lightning rod, is crossing a wide and dangerous road for a timid 🐔 like LZ. She had reinforced her protective bubble-of-isolation over & over again. It's talon-proof. This is just another form of pride, and it will alienate a person. People can be horrible, but isolation becomes a sickness in the bones. Too much alone time will make a person very, very off-kilter ~>> weird. It's difficult to find decent people. When we do, we shouldn't shut them out over fear. That is what LZ begins to do with Sheng, once he notices her. As Sheng makes overtures, LZ becomes terrified and shrinks away.

Nevertheless, things get cluckin, and they're going well. Her shell starts to CRACK. At the first sign of static, LZ runs away like a roadrunner. The agenda-driven mean girls are hen-pecking, and try to make it look like LZ manipulated a situation. Sheng's forced to ""major"" in interpersonal analytics that semester in order to sort out fact from fiction. Part of the sorting process is managing fear. The mean girls played on his fears. Author Terry Goodkind writes that people will believe a thing because they want it to be true or because they're afraid it's true. Fear is useful if it guides us, but not if it rules us or turns us into fodder for manipulation.

The Legend of the White Snake is brought up as an analogy. Per Wiki, it is ""a Chinese legend centered around a romance between a man named Xu Xian and a female snake spirit named Bai Suzhen. It is counted as one of China's Four Great Folktales."" In the show TLOWS-4.5, unrequited love turns a young girl into a villainous monster; she is a constant pest and causes lots of trouble. Sheng's friends keep bringing it up.

Before the end, Sheng's 🌏 will crack. Towards the close of the series, they get into a drama that seems plucked out of nowhere. There are a couple of tiny hints at a family issue from the past, but the build-up is insufficient. That last story arc didn't play as well as the rest of the show. It is worth noting that the secondary romances aren't bad, but they aren't nearly as good as the primary one.

Now for some Scooby Snacks:

🍗 They each buy a seed with a word burned into it. When the seed grows, the word appears on the plant, itself. How awesome is that?

🍗 They are in law school and they do a mock trial of the OJ Simpson case.

🍗 Always dignified, even though she is a bit 🐓, LZ won't be pushed around. ""You have to try this drink or your life won't be complete,"" Sheng urges. ""I prefer a flawed life,"" she shoots back.

🍗 I love how the walls in the girls' dorm are a tribute to Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. LZ frequently mentions the anime Only Yesterday which is a 1991 Ghibli movie. Sheng also likes the film.

🍗 ""Misunderstandings happen when two people are not direct with each other. It results in frustration... Face him bravely,"" A wise friend cautions.

🍗 They are studying for the upcoming Marxism exam. ""What's Marxism?"" One of the guys wants to know.

🍗 On break they don their HS uniforms and sneak into class together. Cute.

🍗 ""When an attractive man tells a lie, he could be quite good at it."" LZ is warned by a woman who got burned.

🍗 Have you heard a quote from Mencken? ""A man makes love by braggadocio and a woman makes love by listening. Once a woman passes a certain point in intelligence, she finds it impossible to get a husband. She simply cannot go on listening to men without snickering.""

Thank goodness our capable LZ didn't pass that point. She's been a 🐓 that moved like a 🐢 all of her life. But, in the second year of college, she joined the human race.

People expect too much of women.

Unrequited Love,Heartfelt,"It's a must watch romance drama for anyone who is currently interested in the genre.

The best thing about this drama is that it portrayed the real world relationship of college students. Couple goes through the difficulties of life. Have fun, trust, misunderstood, argue, fight and then get together like in the real world. And it was all portrayed beautifully with the likeable and easy to attach to characters. You will go through the rollercoaster of emotions when you watch it. It will make you laugh, cry, irritated and love.

Although the series was beautiful, there is a lot that could be improved. It has an happy ending, but it still feels rushed. The dialogues could be improved as well. Overall, you will enjoy watching it."
Unrequited Love,Great drama!,Comentario no disponible
Unrequited Love,Lovely Young Couples,"A pretty delightful love story between college students. The first half of the drama was quite sweet and joyful, but turned into boring ending finally. The young actors and actresses were bringing more fun to this drama, as they offered vivid performance. It seemed like the bright color tone was set up to match the theme of the drama, and I enjoyed the beautiful scenes. However, the drama failed to show audiences that both the girl and the boy were from northern China: they tried to use the accent sometimes, but it only made it feel like fitting a kid's feet into an adult's shoes. I would like it more if they could just keep it simple."
Unrequited Love,Simple and lighthearted story but well written,It's a very simple love story but I loved that every character was well written and had layers to them. It's interesting and every turn to the story makes sense and you keep rooting for the characters to have happy stories. I enjoyed this a lot.
Good Girls,Binged it in two days,"Loved it! Funny, fresh and female centric. Can't wait to see season 2"
Good Girls,Really good but repetitive,Comentario no disponible
Good Girls,I'm hooked!!,"Love this show! It's a mashup of Desperate Housewives and Thelma & Louise. It's funny, yet thought provoking about how far you'd be willing to go to protect your family. A must see show!"
Good Girls,Soccer moms breaking bad,"Action packed, quality tv show leaves you wanting more. Clean enough tv show to not make you feel dirty after watching it, but still an adult show with rich characters. Great writing that I could watch again and again on tv or in the cinema. Classic characters you want to see develop which remind me of Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul. I hope to see these Good Girls tv show characters develop and grow."
Good Girls,This is a GREAT Show,"I don't know what the critics are talking about. I love this show!! I wait for Monday to come around so I can watch. It taps into the ""bad girl"" excitement that is missing in the everyday life of being a mom. And Manny Montana...No explanation needed. I do wish he played a bigger role in the series. I'm hoping we see more and more of him. Ignore the critics and give this show a chance!"
Good Girls,I LOVE THIS SHOW,This Show is amazing!!!! I hope Rio and Beth start something.
Good Girls,If Desperate Housewives and Weeds had a baby...,"...it would be this show. Great storylines with promising development and shockingly convincing and easily likeable characters. As a 30-something housewife and mother of two, I utterly appreciate this show."
Good Girls,It was a surprisingly good first season,Comentario no disponible
Good Girls,rio addict!,"Addicted to Rio's sexy voice, his demeanor, and mysteriousness! I hope they will show his back story!"
Good Girls,They should have ended it,Season one had me hooked up and the following season kept the bar high. But it should have ended there. Season 3 was a major letdown for me. I struggled watching the last episodes of the season and I m not even sure if I'll watch season 4. The characters have become so less likeable and the story is just not believable any more.
Good Girls,A brilliant show - you gotta watch it!,"Good Girls has: Good friends Great suspense Simmering sexual tension Mad true love Deep Mother's love Good cops and wicked bad robbers

This show has it all, told in an an exciting way that keeps you hooked while you laugh and cry.

Hint: I was so caught up in the drama I binged this series in a day, the show should be leisurely enjoyed, a couple of episodes at time, with a good whiskey or bottle of red and some popcorn; Treat yo' self."
Good Girls,Too many missteps and bad choices,"This is a review for both season 1 and season 2 of this show.

This show has both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness in its main characters. Early on, it seems like a worthwhile endevaour to follow the misadventures of these characters, to see what sort of crazy hijinks they get up to, but what plagues them by the of season 2 is the same feeling of staleness that most shows like these struggle with. If characters always get into trouble, then it's neither shocking nor interesting to see how they get out of it, cause you know from the start that they will and that they will inevitably get into more trouble later on.

So this is what I mean by the earlier sentiment. The characters start to feel like paper-cut outs of their earlier selves, where they are put into situations as opposed to naturally growing with the show. Add to this, a frustrating amount of storylines that disappear into nothingness, and you have a show that, while great at times, fails to really deliver on its promise."
Good Girls,So frustrating,"It started kinda fun but then it just became frustrating to the point I am pulling my hair. The girls keep making the same and worse mistakes again and again and again, again, again, again....

Nothing they do has any logic, they play gangsters and think this is a hobby they can switch on and off whenever they want to. They want to be criminals but then they also want to be nice people. They give in to blackmail, demands, extortion, being robbed and losing their money every week, people walking all over them etc.

All you see here is a bunch of stupid housewives that NEVER learn anything, especially from their own mistakes. Annie is probably the worse when it comes to stupid mistakes that has major repercussions, then Beth and then Ruby.

You can't possibly do what they do and still be alive. Way too lucky to get away with the stupid stuff they keep doing.

Rio is just amused by Beth, only reason she is still around. How bothersome can someone be before they get the axe? Obviously the series needs to keep going.

I am still watching it because I am hoping that they will get better. I am hoping for something smart in the end, a nice surprise. They just go in deeper and deeper without any commonsense, you go gangster it is for life.

Oh, and what happened to Boomer's phone and the bag... How did that happen? Or was it just a badly written twist?"
Good Girls,Awesome!,"I freaking love, Love, LOVE this show!! This is such a new kind of show and all the actors are amazing!"
Good Girls,Surprised that I'm addicted,"When I heard about that show I didn't think I had any desire to watch something far-fetched and cheesy. It is neither. Christina Hendricks is amazing, definitely worth the watch, and Matthew Lillard is perfect for this role- just looking at him makes me want to punch him in the face. The younger sister can be annoying but that's the writers fault, and not a reflection of her acting ability. Retta is great and Reno Wilson, although his role is smaller, is perfect. Even the annoying grocery store manager (David Hornsby) is good because you like hating him. Alison Tolman is fun to hate too. All in all? I'm watching the first season for the second time with my husband who likes it too. As one who rarely enjoys free television, I encourage others to stick to original series on Netflix and HBO etc to give it a try. It's a cut above what the three networks usually offer."
Good Girls,Love it!,Comentario no disponible
Good Girls,"Starts off good, declines rapidly","The first two seasons were great. Season three is simply bad. Not thought out, the characters and situations have become repetitive and annoying."
Good Girls,Started well ended terribly,Season 4 is just absolutely awful so many unnecessary stupid story lines that amount to nothing (what was the point of that unbearable English therapist?? ) And the only thing more annoying than Retta (Ruby) is her useless husband Stan. The best thing about this show is Mammy Montana whose acting and looks are fantastic.
Good Girls,3 season is bad,"The first two seasons were great.Third season is pure trash. No development between the characters.Very slow pace and no action.The writers failed to find ideas to move forward. Characters give the impression they don't have any emotions, they just roll with what is happening. It was promising at the beginning but failed to reach its potential."
Good Girls,I'm Happily Surprised,"Unlike other reviewers, I absolutely love this show! The actors are marvelous, the premise is believable, and the comedy actually makes me laugh. I cannot wait for the next episode. How nice to see these dramatic actresses in a new vein. I've even recommended it to my girlfriend in Idaho. Guess I enjoy a difference of opinion then some of the others, but I will look forward to more of these ladies' capers."
Good Girls,Love this show,This show is laugh out loud funny So nice to have a different type of show on TV We are hooked on this one.
Good Girls,A decent show,There's some funny jokes but there's just so many moments where you facepalm & get so angry at their stupidity....
Good Girls,Interesting premise but goes from funny-dumb to frustrating-dumb,Comentario no disponible
Good Girls,loved it,So sad we won't get 5th season. We need it to tie loose ends. Beth & Rio deserved better. Chemistry between actors was out of this world!
Good Girls,Great Show!,"I'm enjoying this show so much! It's nice to see everyday women forced to take on situations like this. The cast works well together. Very diverse, which makes it balanced. Hope to see it return for a second season."
Lovestruck in the City,new take on KD,"This is produced differently than most all KD, One in and i liked it a lot also its not 60-70 min episodes so no need to run the clock out with foolish tactics.ILL give it a fair shot but characters are good only thing that can ruin it is the writers"
Lovestruck in the City,A refreshing drama,"Finally, something different.

What I like most about this drama is that it's a realistic depiction of relationships in today's 21st century. Yes, people can, and will sleep with each other in the early stages of a relationship. I'm so sick of watching other k-dramas that treat 30yr old adults like they're 13yr old kids who have never been kissed before (or freezes during a kiss) let alone any other intimate activities. (In saying that, the last episode does ruin it by doing exactly that!) This drama is refreshing in the sense that it's not your typical love story romance and the filming is unique because it's done in an interview-style manner. I found this strange at first and it was hard to catch on but keep watching and you'll find it all comes together and the storyline becomes riveting. There were many scenes that truly captured the ""moment"" by use of sunlight and light rays to create the right mood and ambience, especially during the beach holiday or romantic scenes. Some scenes were like instagram shots with a perfect filter applied.

The lead actor is gorgeous. I thoroughly enjoyed his acting and looks. I will watch out for more work from Ji Chang Wook. All supporting actors and actresses were also very good and created a significant dynamic. I just found the cop and actress love story introduced in the last episode absolutely useless. They could do without those scenes.

Overall, I recommend this drama if you've watched a lot of k-dramas and looking for different. This is a new style, new age, and refreshing alternative to what you'd normally see."
Lovestruck in the City,"astonishing cinematography, no usual cliché, absorbing story & amazing performance","One of the best series I've ever watched in respect of cinematography and performance is Lovestruck in the City. Actually, I started watching it just for its marvelous and magnificent cinematography but then I was intrigued by its different story, lovely plot, majestic sceneries, sunny beaches, good character development, glamorous songs (especially the one from 'BeetleJuice'), fascinating patterns of cloths and finally phenomenal performance of the lead male role, Ji Chang-wook. I've never watched his dramas before because I didn't find him impressive and he seemed so shallow to me. But after watching this series my idea changed dramatically. At times, I feel that he is not merely playing his role but rather living it really. I don't know if it's in his nature to be like this or he really had some feelings for his co-star; either way, the chemistry that he showed was the one we hardly ever observe in Kdramas. During the whole series he seemed as if he was feeling the joy, despair and frustration of his character in actuality- for eg. Ep04, 08 & 13. I am stunned by his impeccable and intense portrayal of a noble man in love. Although Kim Ji-won did not share the same chemistry as she did in 'Descendants of the Sun (2016)' with her co-star, yet I quite like the way she performed her daring role, especially in sad, angry and serious scenes. I didn't get the same love from her that I got from Ji Chang-wook. However, if she wasn't the main female role, I wouldn't watch this drama for anyone else. It seems among all those who have co-stared Ji Chang-wook so far, she is the most perfect match; because she made him perform remarkably. Apart from few scenes of nudity in ep02 which I don't endorse, I recommend the rest of the drama to anyone."
Lovestruck in the City,New Format and Fresh!!,Update: After watching Ep:2 you won't be able to stop watching it!! Ahh the chemistry! Goosebumps!! Stunned to be honest! Just saw the first episode! The format is fresh and new unlike other Kdramas!! And of course it has The Ji Chang Wook so one can expect great acting! It is quite early to comment on the series but I loved it because of the connection with the audience and it's relativity to real life! Looking forward to more episodes!!!
Lovestruck in the City,"Ratings, we don't need no stinking ratings","I am a person who likes to make up my own mind. Had never seen Ji Chang-Wook in anything before, didn't know it was a comeback after his military service and wasn't aware of Netflix ratings and really don't give a damn. I was captivated from the first episode. The two main characters love play with one another in a new found relationship was wonderful and made me love them both. I loved the interview technique of the show, the writing and the other character snippets were the best. I liked Chang-Wooks descriptions of his feeling and his love. Episode 8 had me crying and I determined gajima (don't go in Korean) is the most compelling and romantic word in the world. I am waiting for Friday so I can watch the next 2 episodes at once. I like shows you have to pay attention to and not just react to some thrills or spills or action figures. Some people just can't be entertained by less than those much over used audience catchers. I for one give this series a 10 so far and recommend it to anyone who is in love, has been in love, wants to be in love, has lost a loved one or has given their love to someone who wasn't able to accept it."
Lovestruck in the City,Good Enough,"Korean Drama "" Lovestruck in the city "" has interesting cinematography and a slice of life story, with a realistic spin on the love stories.

The drama presents the story through the form of a documentary, where the characters are being interviewed about their love lives and their views on love. This format was original and interesting, but it did get tiring after a while. Fortunately, they lessen up the interview time after the first half.

The highlight of the drama is also the love stories that it presented, even though the main one got most of the screening time. It was cleverly presented, with smooth twists that kept the mystery of what happened for a while. The first part of it, where the audience gets to see the beginning of the main relationship, was probably the best part, with a youthful and summery vibe.

Also, the performances were really good from everyone in the cast. The soundtrack was spot on as well.

However, this drama needs to have a second season, as the last episode left a lot of things unfinished and, in fact, opened up new storylines.

So, overall, seven out of ten."
Lovestruck in the City,A refreshing new format of drama,"I like the new style..docu-drama? Great cast,great storyline. A must watch drama"
Lovestruck in the City,Comfort drama fr,"If you are looking for a drama that leaves you feeling sentimental and just happy, I highly recommend this show. Its light hearted but also extremely engaging in how they interconnect romance, common struggles with relationships and insecurities, comedy and storytelling. This drama does an amazing job at bringing multiple plot lines and characters together in a way that isn't jarring and makes sense. I seriously loved this show. Even the soundtrack is perfectly curated to enhance the vibe of the appropriate scenes. That sometimes doesn't happen in dramas. The plot was far from boring and I easily binged this show in a day due to the short episode (for a kdrama which episode are usually an hour). Its so good i keep coming back to rewatch it. Ji Chang Wook did an amazing job and so did Kim Jiwon she stays being one of my fav actresses. I also want to highly commend Ryu Kyung Soo on his performance because i never hear anyone talking about what a great actor he is. I've seen almost all of his dramas and he never fails to impress. Hopefully we will get to see more stuff from him!!!! This show is a must watch defs."
Lovestruck in the City,Aesthetic!!,"Beautiful first episode, everything was perfect. From the strong leads to the way they approached the story, the unique format, aesthetic appeal, the cinematography and the OSTs. All in all a must watch. Eagerly waiting for the 2nd episode."
Lovestruck in the City,GoT level disappointing finish after an intriguing start,"They started out with such fresh, novel storylines that could've been taken towards deep, insightful storytelling. I was hooked by the leads' chemistry and the breathtaking views too. Oh but the ending ! I'm sure they got confused as to how they should end and put a haphazard episode 16 and 17 together that picked up all the initial excitement, chemistry etc and threw it out the window. Very frustrating. The script for epi 17 seems to be so full of blanks, they introduced a new nowhere story leading nowhere in it, and finished a seemingly healthy existing one without proper rationale. Such a waste man. Reminds you of GoT."
Lovestruck in the City,10/10 for the rating,1st because i support Ji Chang Wook but when i watched Ep1 wow! The drama is light and romantic but can relate with our everyday lives and yes its about Love which everyones Joy and curiousitu. Looking forward for the next ep. 👍
Lovestruck in the City,Different from usual Kdramas,"I was skeptical about this one because honestly I lost interest in k dramas. However since i have nothing to do I gave this a chance. It was uninteresting first due to the format. The interview kind format was difficult to connect with. However after 3 - 4 episodes interview part was decreasing and connection with entire cast were formed. I could enjoy after the connection among main characters were established. The most thing I liked was the friendship among the 4 characters. Over all I liked this one but I disappointed that they didn't show the old version of heroine which was very essential. Since its netflix show we could see more than one or two kisses and sexual tension between main characters, it was satisfying."
Lovestruck in the City,Not good,Comentario no disponible
Lovestruck in the City,Captivating format and ever amazing Ji Chang Wook!!!,"Ji Chang Wook is a master of transformation on screen! The storyline is getting more and more interesting with a mixture of humor and depth of emotion, showing the trials and tribulations of romance to which we can all relate. Bravo!!! Great choice of project, Ji Chang Wook!!!"
Lovestruck in the City,A must watch drama.,A must watch drama...love ji changwook forever😍😍😍
Lovestruck in the City,Nice!,"I have liked Ji Chang-Wook and Kim Ji-Won in other Korean dramas and they do not disappoint here, giving us a romantic couple you care about. The other characters also make an important contribution to the story.

Initially I found the docu-drama format overly affected and almost did not get around to watching episode 2. But I am glad I stuck with it, as either I got used to it, or the makers gradually limited the use of this device to moments where it actually contributed. I even found moments where I could appreciate that depth had been added in this way.

The final episode is a bit unnecessary as it focuses on another couple entirely, although their story is nice enough in itself. With different editing we could have had a final episode where all of the main storylines reach their climax, leaving a stronger impression on the memory."
Lovestruck in the City,Great show,"I am very excited about the way the story is being built, mature characters, the story has been told with a different dynamic, charismatic characters and couples with very good chemistry."
Lovestruck in the City,UNREALISTIC AND BORING,"I was excited as it was ji changwook drama and waited with anticipation.But the drama is very boring and dragging.A very dissappointing drama again from ji changwook.The story is unrealistic with the male lead running behind the female lead with no dignity,even after he is dumped and the female lead does not even feel bad for hurting the male lead and they just get back together.Other couples were not given enough role.They concentrated on the leads and dragged the drama.The photography was good."
Lovestruck in the City,Love it but chaotic,"The character of Park Jae Won reminds me so much of myself, that is the main reason i loved this kdrama. He is an incredible actor, and he's done so well in this show. But everything else was chaotic, too much, i couldn't keep up with all the stories.

And what was the point of the last episode with new characters? I just don't get it.

Not good but not bad."

Unauthorized Living,Kind of soapy but watchable,"It's a good show if you're willing to put up with a soap like story. The story is unsubstantiated and not supported well. However, It does have a degree of suspense created by murder, cops and drug trafficking. The one annoying thing is the gay acting. The character Carlos needs toning down. It's looks fake. Enough with the the raising of the hand."
Unauthorized Living,Lot of exciting thrills every episode,Character of Nemo really did a great job ill or not. Ferro as loyal as ever. These 2 characters really raise the bars. All characters really played great.
Unauthorized Living,Compelling binge watching series,"Nemo is the ""Lord"" of the Galitian town of Oeste, he has built the biggest narco business under a facade, he is the larger employer, he is the patriarch of a devious family, he is cunning, smart, ruthless and willing to rough people up, make threats, harass and do anything possible to have his way no matter if the problem is a rival thug or a public officer, but he was diagnosed with Alzheimer and his business is on its way to bankruptcy... And now the story unfolds with great character developments, an array of many violent twists and turns as well as sudden and unexpected surprises to compel the viewer to follow the series. Chapters are long, 70 minutes each, the ending looms with an opening set of incidents to go into a second season."
Unauthorized Living,Excellent,"Nemo and Ferro, fantastic combination, they make this show"
Unauthorized Living,Season 1 is good but Season 2 is AWESOME!,Just trust me and watch the show! I don't have anymore words to describe how good this show is! FERRO IS SPECIAL.
Unauthorized Living,The main actress and some secondary characters ruined it for me,"The main storyline and the main character ,Nemo are enough to keep you watching but there are some situations , mostly driven by poorly acted and written characters, that could make you lose interest in the series. If you can ignore them, you'll be rewarded with a gripping story of loyalty, fragility and some decent action/thrill. I still dont understand the casting choice for the main actress, Lara. Everytime she comes on screen , it runs the whole series. Not sure how to explain it but she is annoying to watch. Maybe is her acting, her script, her inconsistent character development. All of the above? It is just painful. I was hoping they would replace her for season 2 but she came back worse. The colombian hit man is horrible. The show has many annoying characters /actors , the casting director did a horrible job at it."
Unauthorized Living,One of my favourite shows.,The second season is sky high! Luis Zahera- Ferro is stunning.
Unauthorized Living,Same but different,"I love the cast, the characters drawn, the plot, the scenario. Even though there are numerous plot holes, you still enjoy the show and it keeps you at the edge of your seat at many times. I could barely wait till the next episode at the end of every one."
Unauthorized Living,Thrilling till the end,Long time ago that I saw a serie which I wanted to see in 1 day. Every episode is real thrilling and full of unexpected twists!
Unauthorized Living,Serviceable crime drama with emphasis on melodrama,"Despite its many flaws, this is an enjoyable series. The fine acting of Jose Coronado and Pilar Castro keep things cooking with an underlying intensity that a lesser actor - say Àlex Monner with his hand-on-the-hip ridiculous portrayal of the gay son - could not pull off. The camera work and scenery are top notch, making Galicia the real star of the show. Sure, it all tends to get bogged down by over-seriousness and the soap opera tendencies frustrate, but all in all, an involving series that is perfect for binge watching - if you can last through the too-frequent hand wringing personal dramas that at times threaten to bring the whole thing down. (Docked two points for the last episode which resolves nothing but sets the stage for another season. You feel like you've been cheated; the show's makers should be ashamed.)"
Unauthorized Living,10/10 just for Nemo Bandeira,Season 1 was fantastic. Character of Nemo Bandeira was so powerful and the only reason I kept watching the drama till the end of season 2. Ferro had great sense of humor
Unauthorized Living,Teleseries with a usual storyline.,"Series is not so boring, however it gets slow in some moments with the characters.

Series is made of Family, Drama, Revenge you get everything in the show.

Best characters whom you will like, and watch this entire series are Nemo - Jose Coronado and Ferro - Luis Zahera. These two will be keep you up with the series."
Unauthorized Living,Alex Monner's Performance As Carlos Ruined This Show For Me,Comentario no disponible
Unauthorized Living,When S2 is even better than S1!,"I have just finished this series and feel very sad it is over. Great characters that you really invest in, with a towering male lead performance as Nemo, supported by his loyal right hand man, Ferro.

The introduction of the Mexicans really ramped up the action and I can highly recommend this to all lovers of good Spanish crime and family drama."
Unauthorized Living,Traisac ruins it all...,Claudia Traisac's acting is pretty annoying and basic. Overdoing it when there's no need but falling flat when she needs to kick it up a notch. She needs an acting coach on set ASAP. The rest of the cast is incredible and the plot is amazing.
Unauthorized Living,Enjoyed with reservations,"I have not finished watching all episodes but I am enthralled. A great series.

However, I find the gay son's over the top posturing and gay stereotyping detracts from the series. Really?"
Unauthorized Living,Excellent,Lots of twists and turns! Expect the unexpected. Pure entertainment that will keep you watching and wanting more. The characters are very well developed and the views are amazing. See for yourself.
Unauthorized Living,"Nemo,nemo","It started very promising, Jose Coronado is just great. I had a feeling that tv show is going to be modern tv novela without unneeded forbidden romances, unwanted children and overwhelming pathetique and other cliches usual for spanish tv shows. But unfortunately that changed about in the middle of 1st season, focus goes away from nemo on other characters and their stories. Finished firts season and left it on the beginning of second. Great costumes, photography and other technical stuff...."
Unauthorized Living,One of the best Spanish series.,An interesting set up of King Lear by William Shakespeare adapted to the live of a Galician Kingpin.
Unauthorized Living,"Light fun, but over-the-top performance by Àlex Monner","This is a decent show. Nothing groundbreaking, but the characters and performances are good enough to keep me going from episode to episode. With one glaring exception: Àlex Monner's portrayal of Carlos takes the limp-wristed stereotype and attacks it as if it's beef jerky and he's a starving dog. I'm a member of the LGBT crowd and in my entire life I've neither known personally nor seen a gay man act like Carlos. Never. It's ridiculous, and enough for me to drop my 8 to a 7. If he isn't toned down in the second season, I won't be able to watch. Who signed off on his character? Netflix should be embarrassed. Someone here referred to Carlos as a spasmodic Quasimodo, I believe, and that's spot-on."
Unauthorized Living,Extremely entertaining,From the acting to the amazing storyline I have found nothing but excellence. I highly suggest you give this one a try. As for me bring on the second season quickly.

Unauthorized Living,THE ACTING,For the most part all of tge actors and actresses are doing a great job .Especially tge women. The men are decent but Carlos is way too over the top for this to be a cartel movie and it's so so irritating the role is fine but his character is too overbearing .
Forensic,Thank goodness station HLN is astute enough to provide us with an endless string of reruns of this documentary true crime series,"I like many other television viewers have grown very tired of the decades old late night choices of TV talk show hosts and/or reality TV series. I am so grateful for HLN to have made the wise decision to run on almost a daily basis several episodes back to back of Forensic Files episodes. Using my PVR I pre-record them and then tend to watch them binging until I have exhausted the pre-recorded episodes.

Each 30 minute episode provides the summary details of an unsolved crime which may be a murder, sexual assault, missing person(s), or blue collar crime. Each crime story line is narrated and we receive background information on the victim(s), and then methodically the investigation process is explained that results in an arrest of the suspect(s), which sometimes follows details of the actaul trial and subsequent conviction, or in some cases a prior convicted felon's crime is exonerated as new forensic science and/or forensic techniques (such as the future use of DNA) comes in to the crime science laboratories.

These are all true crime episodes, and many of the actual crimes are detailed including video images of the real arrests and/or court trials of the perpertrator(s) that provide a conviction and usually a long term or life sentence.

Anyone who is a crime buff will enjoy this documentary series that stayed on the air for so many seasons. I hope they resurrect this excellent true crime series sometime in the near future.

I give this crime/drama/documentary series an excellent 9 out of 10 rating"
Forensic,Four Reasons Why This Show Is A Winner,"Episode after episode, year after year, this program has been entertaining. It almost never fails. There is a reason it has been on the air for 15 years.

After watching a few episodes, I became hooked....and, yes, this is an addicting show. I found myself watching over a hundred shows (my DVR had a workout) in two months. I'm sure many others have found themselves doing the same.

Why is this show good? First, it is true crime, not some fictional story; second, it runs only a half hour. Crime shows that are an hour long often repeat stuff over and over. A half hour is perfect. Third, the cases are always interesting. They leave you shaking your head in disbelief that people actually do some of these things reported in here. Fourth, Peter Thomas is excellent as the narrator. His is a voice which never offends, or gets old.

Currently, it can be seen regularly on the HNN cable network."
Forensic,"Used to be ""Medical Detectives""","I always laugh when I see people say ""Forensic Files"" is ""the latest entry into forensic TV"" or ""jumping on the forensics bandwagon"" or such. The show started on TLC/Discovery Networks as ""Medical Detectives"" back in 1996. When it switched over to CourtTV, Discovery was still running some episodes so they changed the name. (Now all those episodes are re-labeled ""Forensic Files"" and are seen on Court TV.) In fact, the show still airs as ""Medical Detectives"" in many countries overseas. (It is also known, I believe, as ""Crime Seen"")

The show is in it's eleventh season of production. The show didn't jump on the bandwagon - it got it rolling in the first place!

If you watch ""C.S.I."", many of the techniques (such as using alternate video treatments to show recreations, and showing different recreations of how the crime MIGHT have happened as the evidence changes), you can see that they watched ""Forensic Files"" while developing their show. They also used to get plenty of story ideas from this and other true-crime shows."
Forensic,Peter Thomas is a true hero!,"Forensic Files is a fascinating show and the jewel in the Court TV networks crown. It is like a real life version of Quincy. It is hard hitting and realistic and above all educational. We are so lucky today to have such amazing advances like DNA analysis and criminal profiling that would help capture criminals who not so long ago would have escaped justice for their crimes. Watching one episode is like eating one delicious potato chip, you just cannot stop. It is fascinating! Why just the other night they talked about the Malvo-Muhammad sniper case and the John List mystery. John List had murdered his family and escaped justice for almost twenty years and they made a bust of his face and showed what he would look like twenty years later. Thanks to Forensics and the power of America's Most Wanted he was finally captured and brought to justice fo9r the murder of his wife, mother and three children. The thing that makes Forensic Files for me is Peter Thomas the narrator. Simply put, he makes the show what it is. He makes it just like Leonard Nimoy made In Search Of... or Robert Stack made Unsolved Mysteries. He has got one of the best storyteller voices that I have ever heard. There is something else that you need to know, Peter Thomas is a true American hero. He served with the First Infantry Division in World War II and won the Silver Star and The Purple Heart. I write to celebrities as a hobby and recently wrote to Mister Thomas. He sent me one of the nicest replies that I have ever gotten. He even sent me a poem that he wrote about his experiences and the horrors of war that he saw."
Forensic,Fascinating!,"This is undeniably one of the best crime shows on TV. It's approach on suspense is top-notch and the wonderful narration is haunting. These are real life cases, with some reenactments, and it shows you how the crimes get solved with reliable forensics.

It's structure is simple. We open up to a place where it gives us back-story on the victim. Then, there's a killer on the loose and the police turn to science for help. Usually, it ends on a good note, it's predictable yet hypnotic. Justice is served, so it ends with closure for the family & friends of the victim(s) and satisfaction for law enforcement. An excellent message to its target audience!

UPDATE: the show is not on YouTube, watch it when you get a chance! I recommend viewing it at night time in the dark, it makes the show so interesting."
Forensic,The absolute best of the best,"Forensic Files (the original series narrated by Peter Thomas) is, the best crime documentary shows ever created. I also think that narrator Peter Thomas, who passed away in 2016, had much, if not EVERYTHING to do with it. His voice, his timing was so compelling that it really added to the suspense and dramatic effect of the show."
Forensic,My favorite way to unwind!,"This is my favorite true crime show. It doesnt go overboard with the reenactments, and I always learn something new each time. After a few episodes you get to know the formula, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. This is probably my favorite way to relax after a long day, which sounds strange, but the narrator's calming/ slightly cheesy voice and the super 90s background music help me tune out the world and relax. There are like 400 episodes, but I will keep rewatching them forever because no other true crime show gets me like this one."
Forensic,As good as it gets,"This show set the bar for investigative forensic tv shows. Each episode is a mini documentary with no fluff, just cases and evidence. This show should have continued FOREVER."
Forensic,Show reminds you that there is no perfect crime.,"This show tells true crime stories of how the use of forensic evidence, from the identification of fingerprints to examining hair, and from tracking barcodes to tracking phone records, can lead to the location and capture of suspects. Each half-hour episodes start off with a mystery of an unsolved crime - intriguing and suspenseful. It then leads to a thrilling hunt of the criminal and the forensic attempts at tying the evidence to a suspect.

Peter Thomas does a great job in narrating each episode, making each story foreboding. It's sad to see the evil acts a person inflicts on another, but with forensic evidence, it comes to show that there is no perfect crime and certainly these criminals can't get away with murder.

Grade A"
Forensic,An oldie but a goodie!,I love Forensic Files! This sounds weird but Peter Thomas' (RIP) voice is so soothing that I fall asleep to this show every night. Great stories and the science is interesting.
Forensic,Can't even explain how great this show is,"Forensic Files is a fascinating show. Each episode is 22-minutes long, centers on an actual serious crime, and there's a solution at the end. Law enforcement officials actually watch this show, even in a couple of cases they admitted solving a crime based on information they learned during the show. It can't get any better than that. Occasionally the episode is about a mysterious illness that affected a town, but there's always a resolution at the end. The narrator has this cool voice and he speaks with a well-balanced tone without much dramatization, which makes it more appealing."
Forensic,"A winning program every time! KUDOS to PETER THOMAS, narrator.","Anyone interested in seeing the worst of America brought to justice through top notch detective work and modern forensics as well? This program is for you, a sobering look at real life cases and all wrapped up in a half hour.

Those wanting more details can do internet searching. But the half hour program is fast paced and full of actual/real life facts and pictures, mixed appropriately with dramatized situations that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The REAL GEM of the show is the voice of PETER THOMAS, truly a genius at vocal delivery, who uses his skills to usher you from start to finish in a professional manner!"
Forensic,interesting insight into the minds of criminals and the investigators who find them,"This show is well put together and on a few occasions as I viewed an episode I could recall reading about the case in the newspaper not long before. This made for an even more interesting watch. Unfortunately every time I view this program I cant help but to think that someone else out there watching is taking notes on what not to do if they are to commit a similar crime and get away with it. In this respect the content of the show is a bit unnerving because it reveals too many of law enforcements methods. I can imagine this program giving someone false hope in thinking that they could outsmart the investigators who would later try to piece together their actions. Even if that person is ultimately proved guilty, they still may have committed a crime that wouldn't have otherwise taken place had they not watched this show. I think on one hand the show is well intentioned and shares some very impressive forensic methods but on the other hand in doing so may be a little too thought provoking."
Forensic,Turned sexual,"I used to love watching FF. However, I noticed more and more than when there was a female victim, inappropriate photos would be used to show their life when they were alive. Photos of the victim in a bikini, dressed sexually, etc. Were used to show the victim. To compare, male victims are never seen similarly when shown photos of when they were alive. Additionally, more and more air time was comprised of strip club scenes that are very visual. They used to be brief and the point would be evident-the person used to frequent them, work there, whatever it may be. Now, they're over-used and to the point where it almost specializes the victim and it's unnecessary. They will repeatedly show strip club scenes throughout episodes and it takes away from the storyline. Disappointed with the direction of the show."
Forensic,Addicting true crime series..,"This was at one point probably my single most watched show.. The important difference between this show and most other forensic-y shows out there is that this one is based completely on actual cases. In the same vein as A&E's ""American Justice"" or Discovery's ""Cold Case Files"", but the running time of just 30 minutes (as opposed to an hour) makes this the perfect single serving show. The shows premise is true murder cases which were solved thru forensics, but I'm not a big forensics nerd so that part of the show, while interesting, doesn't necessarily intrigue me. What I do find fascinating is the little slice of life (death?) that is each episode. It chronicles what surely is the biggest event in most of the involved peoples lives. All of episodes (with very few exceptions) took place in America within the last decade or two, so for most of us these are events which may have occurred around us, relatively recently. As others have mentioned the pacing, narration, actual footage, photos, and interviews with those involved are well done and relevant. Each case is like a little mystery, and whats great is that of course you always find out who actually perpetrated the crime. My main critique is that occasionally certain facets or details of a case which I would like a little more clarification on are overlooked."
Forensic,"Fascinating, addictive watching",Comentario no disponible
Forensic,Only 51 reviews on one of the most watched shows ever,"... That's interesting that one of the most watched and re-run shows of all time only has 51 reviews on the biggest movie data base. I admit, I've watched and rewatched this series. The stories are fascinating although the ones involving children are especially hard to watch. The thing that concerns me is that this show also tells criminals how to try to cover their tracks. But perhaps it also tells would-be criminals that they will get caught.

I think part of the popularity compared to the many crime reinactment shows is the voice of the narration being a soothing male voice instead of the typical excited female voice; also the fact that it tells the event, the steps, and the results without inserting reitteration of supposition that true-crime shows typically believe will keep us interested. We're not sitting there rolling our eyes and screaming Get to the frickin point! It takes itself and the victims much more seriously. The narrator, Peter Thomas, is the voice of Forensic Files. The newer format where they have the families and detectives doing most the talking is just not as compelling."
Forensic,Binge watched the whole series (not sure what that says about me ...),"This might sound weird, but my beloved cat died a few years ago unexpectedly, and in my grief I started watching this show, and just couldn't stop. I don't know why I felt the need to continue on at the rate I was going, but the TV show was a good distraction.

I like that this show has victims' family members, or sometimes even survivors of attempted crimes, featured on the show - it gives them the opportunity to speak out, and in the case of family members allows them to give life to those who have been lost, by giving insight into the sort of people they were to those who cared about them.

I think that although each episode is quite short, they pack a lot into that short space of time. It's also interesting seeing how crimes were handled in the early days of forensic science, and as the series goes on from season to season, you see scientific/technological advances being made. Occasionally, cold cases are solved due to those advances as well."
Forensic,Number one best TV show,"How did they do it? It's flawless, intriguing & memorable. I will watch from ep 1 all the way through and then just start back at the beginning."
Forensic,Spooked me more than any horror movie,"I was introduced to ""Forensic Files"" by a coworker while doing shift work. Let me tell you! This show is worse than watching any horror movie while on night shifts. I wasn't afraid for myself, I was afraid for my family at home while I was at work. Yet, I couldn't stop watching. I loved the myriad ways the various police departments were able to catch their perps. For squares like me it made me not even consider trying to get away with a crime."
Forensic,I go to sleep with the voice of Peter Thomas,"Yes, it is true; I do drift off to sleep with the voice of Peter Thomas playing on my TV in the background; however, sadly, the show plays at 2 am in my area, so it is only on Saturday nights that I am up late enough to tune to Forensic Files and keep it on after I turn off the light and hear narrator Peter Thomas's warm, soothing, seventies-kind of voice that reminds me of the crime drama TV shows of my childhood.

Forensic Files was on in the '90s-2000s, so it is like a neat time warp that he was cast twenty years past his voice.

I don't know if there will ever be a voice again like Peter Thomas. What a treat."
Forensic,The crime show,"Just the best crime show ever made. Hundreds of cases, 'Forensic Files' is legendary."
Forensic,"Worth 10/10, easily.","I loved this show. I stumbled upon it on Netflix maybe a year ago because I couldn't find anything else. I went into it assuming it would be one of those shows my grandpa would watch but it could be interesting enough to play it in the background while I do work around the house. After a couple episodes I stopped doing any work and was locked into the screen.

I must've been through this entire series in about two months. I also got everyone I possibly could to give this a shot, and before I knew it people were texting me every day about the episodes they were on. It became somewhat of an obsession for quite a lot of us.

The narrator, Peter Thomas, is perhaps one of the greatest narrators for a documentary series ever. Over time you'll start to recite the words he's going to say before he even says them (if you watch the series I've got one word for you- Luminol. As an added bonus I'll also mention Super Glue Fuming). The stories they told were never, ever bad, but some were obviously way better than others though I swear there isn't a single bad episode of this. The re-enactments could sometimes be corny as hell, but even the creators said this was intentional so that nobody would confuse the acted scenes for real footage.

Overall, if you like crime docs, or if you're like millions of others who got into Making a Murderer you should at least give this show a chance. There's hundreds of hours of show here, it will consume your life and it's totally worth it."
Forensic,Stop the Music,"Turn off the music that has been added to Forensic Files episodes. First of all the music is not fitting. The music drowns out the person speaking. Can't watch without Closed caption. Find that music so annoying. I have been watching FF for many years but now find I am turning it off or turning off the sound.

Not sure why I have to enter a long review to qualify. I thought it best to keep it short so as to get the attention of the producers."
Forensic,Please Get a New Narrator for Season 2,"I am sorry, but Bill Camp is not a suitable replacement for Peter Thomas. Camp sounds like he is reading from a Hollywood script. I think the narrator from The FBI Files would be a good choice. I like some of the other suggestions, such as Keith David or Keith Morrison. Bill Kurtis is good, too. I also miss the shadowy scenes they used to show on the original episodes."

Tales by Light,If you're interested in photography then you will enjoy Tales by Light,"The short 30 minute episodes have been shot all over the world featuring different travel photographers who explain why they enjoy their profession so much. Great for inspiration, with lots of cultures and natural places covered. After watching the full first series I went out to complete some landscape and documentary photography myself!"
Tales by Light,Excellent,"One of the finest and spectacular documentaries ever created, although it is not a technical documentary about photography, the filming along with the video, make this spectacular documentary something unmissable, recommended for all those who enjoy freedom and nature. Simply excellent."
Tales by Light,Photographically Inspiring,"As an amateur photographer, I really enjoyed the behind the scenes look into some of the best photographers shooting today.

Observing the thought process of these guys and gals in regard to composition, lighting, creativity, and the amount of hard work and dedication that goes into getting one great shot is what really made this series. Yes the technology helps, as Art Wolfe stated numerous times, but the latest Canon gear aside, there are no great photographers that are lazy and unmotivated.

Being most interested in landscape photography, I especially enjoyed the Art Wolfe episodes. Gorgeous cinematography and incredible photos throughout the series were just an added bonus.

A couple of somewhat minor annoyances. Being a Canon funded series, the in your face advertising was a bit over the top. I almost expected to see a lion wearing a Canon branded dog collar or something. I also became rather worn down towards the end of the series by the ""protect the environment"" cliché. Unless this was intended for children, know your audience: we get it already.

Regardless, great series."
Tales by Light,Most beautiful documentary ever made!,"The concept itself sounds first pretty self indulging, but right after the first five minutes the sheer perfectness of the cinematography itself takes hold of you and you only beg for more!

The crisp, blade-sharp pictures, the always spot-on framing, perfect compisitions make this a visual orgasm.

And after the first episode I can not ever think of any documentary can ever again get away for not using drones for aerial footage. Drone birds-eye view is not just a gimmick, it is skillfully executed and adds great value to the spectacle.

I do NOT say it is the best of documentaries, but it IS the most visually spectacular yet.

Also, some of the photographers are bit pretentious and full of themselves but anyone is free to mute and put on some cinemix or any music of their liking, kick back and swim in the nicest piece of motion picture of this year."
Tales by Light,AN amazing 4k Documentary series ahead of it's time.,"The Series was filmed in 6k and 4k with broadcasters capable of almost broadcasting it in HD. The film is nothing short of a visual festival that tantalizes your senses and keeps you inspired to watch further.

Each episode has it's own unique photographer taking us on a journey to a beautiful setting with worthwhile talent to capture the ultimate photograph.

This mini series is unique in that it uses modern technology to capture photographs in remote locations around the world.

From Nepal to Africa, the crew capture unique photographs deserving of a world wide audience, whether you have an interest in photography or not."
Tales by Light,Wonderful,"A show that educates you about animals, culture, social issues, and travel through the lense of a camera. It's captivating."
Tales by Light,What a beautiful show!!!,This show with short episode and with a very beautiful pictures and a message that just touch your soul!! With background music tht just keep me going like magic.. watch it.
Tales by Light,S3 EP1. Orlando Bloom - UNICEF ambassador of looking disgusted at bangladeshi people.,"There's a small montage of photos of Orlando Bloom ""UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador"", hanging out with various press-worthy impoverished brown and black people. But the people are either obscured by Orlando's head or out of focus.

He spends the rest of his screen time tip-toeing around trash, trying to not get his boots muddy, complaining about the smell in front of the people that have to live there and looking utterly revolted at everyone and everything, all the time.

This episode/unicef advert, doesn't attempt to discuss the political/economic reasons behind why these people are so neglected or what can be done to raise them out of poverty and neither does Bloom (but I'm assuming it's donate to unicef)."
Tales by Light,This should be free to watch all around the world!,"Stunning images, great script and brilliant idea to educate people. Humans, this is not only about photography, this is real and this is NOW. The guy is just trying to help us to make a change, not only to rate his video on IMDb. It's more than a documentary, it's more than staying home and watch Netflix, it should be an eye opener for all of us that own a watching device. I told myself from begining of 2019, if I don't change anything, all these will be done for nothing. Respect!"
Tales by Light,The western professional and the objectification of the Other,"Haven't seen the whole series, to be honest. But the ""tribes"" episode was quite disturbing at times. How I see it, there were some serious issues concerning the objectification of the indigenous people (""my subjects"", as the photographer -Art Wolfe- calls them). Some scenes in particular (but certainly not solely) where Wolfe was setting the ""stage"" for his photograph, i.e. the indigenous people, asked to perform their tribalism in front of the western audiences (""my audience"", as Wolfe describes). There's your scent of cultural imperialism (and of an overambitious western professional), or of the colonization of the Other, if you prefer, the Other who is, only when in contact with the western and only as the western wishes to see her.

This objectification, however, is well disguised by Wolfe's ambition to keep a record of vanishing cultures for mankind, there is even a manifestation, where the photographer realizes that (I quote): ""the western civilization was gonna slam into their culture."" Without realizing that his camera does exactly the same thing: there's your tribe, as colorful and as primitive as you expect it to be.

There are of course some really powerful pictures and a very professional approach through every segment of the film, I just wonder whether it is really necessary to make this kind of docs, if this quest for the ""perfect"" and ""powerful"" photograph is really worthy. To me it just brings afront the same old power relations between the West and its Others. I could (or rather, I'm trying to) live without them."
Tales by Light,Sickening,"It is sickening to see white westerners, ""explore"" other people's of this world as if they are at a zoo, while they take beautiful pictures and documentaries they get paid for, and stroke their own pathetic egos.

When it comes to entitlement of the nature and animals, I can take it. Fine. Just have ""advanced"" westerners filming parts of the world that doesn't belong to them and sell me the content.

But in some episodes here, you are actually in other people's lands, homes and in their real lives. It is painful and surreal, seeing a wealthy white man pointing his camera at people with endlessly longer heritages and fuller cultures, or people with miserably poor conditions, while he finds it exciting or enjoys the technical aspects of his photography. If you don't see the dehumanisation in this program, a part of your soul is missing.

Non westerners, the majority of planet earth, should stop being so good hearted and charmingly welcoming to the white man with the camera at some point. Unfortunately they don't have our perspective from the West, and they don't know about the subconscious/conscious smugness, and the exploitation behind the camera.

Even more sickening when they pretend they are holier than thou and that they are accomplishing something for these objectified humans.... How much of your pay checks did those poor slum children actually get?? You know, the ones who are the entire content of your ""work""??

No matter how beautiful the scenery or cinematography, despite my actual curiosity of the world we live in, I couldn't stomach the whole series. The cringe wasn't worth it."
Tales by Light,Nothing technical,"It really isn't about photography. It's about photographers. Nothing technical. Nothing about gear, or technique or skill. It's just random photographer of the week goes to a far off place and takes pictures of the culture."
Tales by Light,completely misses the mark of photography,This show is complete cinematographers its all about getting good video and not about the photos! Its a complete let down when your sitting down to watch some of the most amazing photographers in the world but you don't really get the photos at all...

Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Not his best,"I am a big fan of Derren Brown, through the years he has made me laugh, think, and be struck with awe. This, however, felt a little too staged at times. I get that they have to edit it down to a length and pace that don't scare people away, but it would have benefitted from 10-15 minutes more. I was entertained, though.

What baffles me the most, is the other reviewers here who bash it for its ""political agenda"". To you I will just say, that when you write stuff like this, it looks like you're okay with people hating, and killing, others for no good reason. Also, you obviously didn't pay attention, as Derren ended the show with talking about how both extremes could come together to find a solution. But maybe you had already turned out, because you were hurt that they told you that killing is bad. Seeing this as a political agenda doesn't reflect well on you. Not killing shouldn't be a left or right issue, it should be a human issue."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Derren Brown and I have been for a long time. He is extremely talented and his work is completely unique. This project is very creative and well executed. I found the participant very likeable. Sadly though, whatever this has going for it is tainted by the underlying political propaganda. I think Derren should be allowed to incorporate his political opinions into his work, but, I have the right to criticise him for doing so. I watch his content to be entertained, I can make up my own mind about politics. Since Donald Trump became President, I have lost so much respect for entertainers I used to love. I don't mind that they have different political opinions to myself, I just wish they weren't all so relentless about forcing their views on me. To put this in perspective, being a conservative and watching this, would be like me making a show where the overall message is 'you should go to church' and making a famous atheist like Derren watch it. Overall I liked it enough to watch it, but, it is certainly not my favourite thing Derren Brown has ever done."

Derren Brown: Sacrifice,A TV show,"Derren Brown's stunts were okay when they were shorter. The format is getting longer, the stories are not. So it goes slow and boring. To an already announced result. That is not that convincing."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Thought provoking but extreme at times,"I've been following Derren Brown for a long time and have heard of his mighty experiments with a huge production setup. This one was also similar and I enjoyed it. It was very thought-provoking and I have always noticed Derren picking up the right candidate for an experiment and that's one of his biggest skills. This is very important for an experiment like this. Once again he gets the right candidate.

Although thought-provoking I felt a little extreme at times. Don't expect a straightforward experiment. The candidate was perfect for this experiment and as mentioned above Derren's main victory lies in picking that exact candidate."

So throughout this, I was expecting an end that was different from what actually happened. The journey was amazing and really powerful.

Derren Brown: Sacrifice,"Must see, Would have have it 10 stars but.....",This show is so interesting and eye opening and honestly had a great message almost everyone should see but...I struggle with the manipulation
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Forced,"Huge Derren fan but his latest release felt very forced and over politicised. Although the main protagonist wasn't an actor it had the feeling that he was in the way he was so forthrite in his views, yet showed a huge amount of compassion when these beliefs were challenged with very basic tasks. Just didn't have that usual uniqueness you come to expect with Derren. It feels like he may almost have some sort of writers block and new releases are now just rehashed versions of older projects. This had the feel of other stuff he's done just in a political guise but despite all that I was still entertained."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Another thriller from Derren Brown,"Just like Derren Brown's The Push (AKA Pushed to the Edge), this short film left me and my friends on the edge of our seats, hands shaking in anticipation. But where The Push left us with questions of morality, Sacrifice replaced that with genuine tugs at our heartstrings. In hindsight, I can see where other reviewers may believe that the events were contrived or fake, but this was indistinguishable while watching the film. Taking everything at face value, I was very impressed with the show and would recommend it to most people."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Brilliant,"I don't really do reviews but I thought this was incredible, twice during this 45 minute show I had tears running down my face. The stare was just lovely, seeing how something so simple got the reaction it did from a pretty intolerant person. Tears. And of course the end, which again was lovely and seemed so genuine. Tears. I'm trying to avoid spoilers and be vague but if you haven't seen this and want a genuinely smart, moving and interesting show that lasts as long as an episode of Smallville then give it a go. I've never really watched any of Darren Browns shows but I think I will be doing."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,"Good entertainment, but infuriatingly invalid","I feel like Derren just likes coming across as a devilish manipulator. Sometimes he likes making people do bad things (rob an armored money carrier, assassinate someone, push someone off a building) other times like this he makes people do something heroic (save a falling aeroplane, survive an apocalypse).

Regardless, he'll give it some positive pithy spin in terms of how we can all be better people blah blah blah, and not resist giving wry little edited-in smirks while nasty things are happening. Oh Derren you devil you!

The problem here is in the concept of 'making' someone do something. There's a bizarre conflict in telling the person they did it all by themselves, are a hero etc, while implying throughout the whole show that actually no - it was Derren that made them do it using all his 'clever' manipulation.

Sacrifice was like a reversal of Heist - using a bunch of empowering techniques (misdirected as NLPish embedded commands, anchoring and whatnot, but who really knows what goes on behind the scenes, I'm sure some strong hypnotic suggestibility and dual-reality helps enormously with the results), and little jingles to push a particular action. The whole point of his methods is how easily people can be influenced and manipulated, so leaves us none the wiser as to what a person would 'really' do in the circumstances - so its all pretty irrelevant.

By the time he's using it as some symbol of how 'whats possible when he step outside of narrow narratives we tell ourselves' I just cringe. Its no more inspiring or educational than a lame Facebook picture quote. Make your mind up Derren - do people really have a 'choice' or are we all influenced by one agenda, cause, trigger, stimuli, narrative after another? Find me a racist bigot who 'chooses' to take a bullet of his own free will to save the target of his racism, without all the grooming/suggestion/empowering/obvious-tv-expectations/manipulation and I'll be inspired.

By the way - how could the guy in the car, after hearing the often-played jingle play TWICE in a row, NOT realize the scene is part of the TV show? Of course he would, part of him would absolutely know its all part of an elaborate role-play linked to what's happened before, so he's going to act according to expectations. Its all a bit contrived and nonsensical, but still enjoyable as entertainment."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Hubris and Hypno-manipulation,"I've always felt a great ambivalance for Derren Brown: I've watched everything he's ever done, but always with a strange mixture of admiration and cringing discomfort, due to the exploitative nature of his work, and how much further he crosses the line in manipulating his 'victims' lives and minds than other stage magicians.

Then there's the interjection of his own beliefs and opinions about the world into his act, such as his shows about faith healers and mediums, which it's hard to divorce from his strongly held atheism. In that instance, I think most people would forgive him, since outing charlatans can never really be that bad, can it? Doesn't everyone benefit from that?

But this one pushes the line even further, through being so explicitly political, specifically pushing a Democrat/'liberal' open borders party line over immigration.

Now, concerns about mass immigration - and especially illegal immigration, as in this instance - are widespread all over the western world today, are strongly affecting the outcome of all elections, and are probably shared by going on half the population. So to depict anyone sharing those concerns as simply a racist white nationalist is arrogant, crass and condescending, but that is what Brown does throughout, with nary a flicker of self-doubt.

What is most insulting is the depiction of anyone not sharing his own political beliefs as someone needing 'curing' of their wrongthink, pathologizing the opposing political viewpoint and then openly manipulating a person's mind to change them into line with how he would choose them to vote.

I found the ease with which Brown would be happy to manipulate the political opinions of another human being, in another country, to be actually quite chilling.

The whole thing was way, way too partisan and preachy. If you don't think so, try imagine him making a show about hypnotizing a Guardian/HuffPo reader into seeing how catastrophic unchecked mass immigration is, and how they need to do something drastic about it RIGHT NOW. And, having come to that conclusion, that's the happy ending.

Well, maybe that will be Derren's *next* show.

On top of that, as other reviewers have already pointed out, it really feels as though he's about run out of ideas, and so is only focusing on finding new ways to dress up old tricks we've seen so many times before in new and headline-grabbing ways.

For all of this, it's still done very well, and as usual with Brown, it feels on a much more lofty level to anything else one could try to put forward as 'competition'. So it's still 'entertaining', I guess, but very troubling, too."
Derren Brown: Sacrifice,Clearly staged-don't bother.,"No way is this real. At one point, an ""all of this is true"" subtitle shows on the screen while the host explains to the rube that he is part Israeli - uuuhhh, no. That's not how genetics work. There is no ""isreali"" blood, a country founded in the 20th century with multiple ethnic groups.

Also, all ""candid"" dialogue is so completely, obviously written (the rube's ""diary"" video) that it seems like an audition tape for The Young and The Restless. GTFOH.

Great interview on Joe Rogan, which turned out to be just another set of lies."

The Hills,It's fun while it lasted.,"There is something about this show that is different from other reality shows and it's mostly negative things. I mean it's a fun show and all but let's keep it real. The women (mostly young girls) are the ones who watch this show. It is incredibly feminine and it is way too monotone for a guy to pay attention to unless he really wanted to. I don't know why they would want to though since the drama is also very high school and childish. A bunch of he said she said and girls screwing each other over and fighting over guys and boyfriend drama. None of them seem to have mature relationships and it seems more of the fault of the people who are producing this show. They are taking the reality out of it and creating a bunch of soapy material. You can also feel the scenes are being set up by the producers to start petty drama that probably wouldn't exist if they weren't on the show. Do people still tune it? Absolutely. It was actually pretty popular but it still would have benefited from being a little more realistic.

There are all of these conflicts that can easily be resolved if you just stop speaking to those people. They are not still in school and they can easily avoid the people they don't like. This show obviously doesn't get that. It's not like the Real World or Jersey Shore where everyone is stuck in the house together and yet the same group of people hang out with one another. There is not much sight of other family members that some of these people are known for seeing all the time when the cameras are not around. There are also paparazzi around them 24/7 and them going into interviews and photo shoots but none of that is seen on the show since this show is trying to portray these girls as working jobs at places like Epic Studios and Teen Vogue where they are the ones who work behind the scenes for the famous people and are not famous themselves. This show doesn't display what we all know is that these girls get the royal treatment and get free designer stuff and get VIP to the Super Bowl and concerts and red carpet events. They are trying to portray them as normal everyday girls who just happen to be wealthy and have some connections to jobs that us watching don't get because we are not the 1% of the population and we don't live and can't afford Hollywood Hills homes.

Overall, it is mostly fun due to the drama but then again, that's why so many young girls love it. Warning: It is filmed in such a dull way because it seems like there is more talk about drama and less action, yelling and fist fighting. These women look like they have so much self control because they seem to have fights in a calm and rational manner, totally unrealistic but it's okay."
The Hills,It should have stopped at Laguna beach,"This show is somewhat addictive, but I don't like it too much. I watch it on and off, hence the reason i gave it a five, but other than that, I think Lauren Conrad should have stopped at Laguna Beach.

My mind deceived me, because i LOVED Laguna beach seasons 1&2, so i thought the hills would be good, if not better. But sometimes change isn't good.

The show is said to be superficial, and i don't doubt it. It's pretty much something you see in a movie, something totally scripted.

In total, I don't mind the show much but if you really have something better to do/watch...do it."
The Hills,"not good, not awful","Overall, we all know this show isn't good television. But that's a given; it's reality TV. When The Hills came out I was about 14 or so. I had never seen Laguna Beach, but my big sister had and was pretty into the The Hills. Whenever she would watch it I would be like ""ugh this show is so stupid and fake"". Which it is, but as I watched more episodes with her I couldn't help but get sucked in a little. Some of the characters seemed more down to earth and real than others, which made it a bit more likable. Bur I think I even liked MTV Canada's after show better. They all just talk about what happened on The Hills. Once even Lauren said on the after show that a phone between her and Spencer was all editing and didn't happen. So yeah, obviously ""scripted reality"" but if you feel like watching something light, mindless, with some nice clothes, it's not the worst. I've seen worse shows."
The Hills,There is no way this crap is real,"I watched a couple episodes of this last night, because my friends girlfriend was watching it. It was painful! This is the lamest show ever made! The guys are douche bags and the girls are dramatic little whiners.

This is the kind of crap that 9-13 year old girls should watch. My friends girl was trying to tell me that it's all real and non scripted. THAT'S BULL! There is no way that this show is real. The acting is extremely poor. IF this is real, then these people need to be put to sleep. I would never want to live a life like that.

BASIC RUNDOWN OF THE HILLS: Material Girls who are rich because of ""Mommy and Daddy"", have douche bag boyfriends who are rich because of ""Mommy and Daddy"". Some of the girls like each other, some don't. The odd fight here and there. Constant lame drama, which in the end everything goes back to normal. The girls are naive as hell.

Anyone who watches this show is a sheep. 0/10 COMPLETE CRAP!!!!!!!!!!"
The Hills,"7,000 years since the dawn of civilization, and this is what we've amounted to...","This show embodies the summum of materialism, the very worst in mankind. How can one be so completely preoccupied with the exterior, and not care about (or not see) what that makes them into? The Hills' cast consist of models. People who are seemingly so drawn into life's popularity contest that anything else ceases to be important to them. The entire globe could be in the middle of some horrible disaster, while these shallow fashion whores' only worry would be finding a pair of shoes that goes with their Prada purse. For some reason, watching this show reminds me of the infamous statement made by beauty pageant contestant Lauren Upton (the URL below). I wonder if this show's cast could find the USA on a world map...

The Hills,was laguna beach not enough?..,"While trying to watch an episode of the hills, i kept finding myself getting distracted by my cat chasing his tail. After all, watching my cat chase his tail was much more entertaining.

This show is so obviously scripted it's not even funny to call this a reality show. Why doesn't MTV just give it up and tell the truth. I guess that would actually mean admitting that these people's lives aren't that interesting unless a little bit of lines are thrown in there because let's be honest- how much fun could it be to actually watch people from their day to day lives? I really am waiting and hoping for mtv to shut down because they keep coming up with one lame thing after another and it has nothing to do with music like it had originally intended."
The Hills,Reality-show Valium,"Watching the people communicate on this show is like experiencing the shadow world that lies between sleep and wakefulness. Shallow words are spoken, followed by long pregnant pauses, meaningful looks and toothy smiles. There is waiting and then more waiting for something. It would be even more freakish than it is, if not for the fact that the women have such model-perfect looks and are a pleasure to look at. However, this would be intolerable and even hellish if regular-looking people pulled this. Conversation has been edited down to very feather-light fluff. Ambiance is always as tasteful as a romantically-lit, high-tone restaurant or a smart little clothing boutique. It's one long perfume commercial."
The Hills,My favorite trashy reality show.,I love disassociating from my own life while watching this show.
The Hills,"The definition of a ""guilty pleasure""","I know it's scripted, and Spencer should be definitely sent to a mental institution, but it's very addictive. The drama is entertaining in that trainwreck sorta way.

It reminds a bit of my life. Sure, I'm not rich, and I don't live in L.A., but there are some similarities. For example, I know lots of Spencers who pick up fights with anyone with a pulse. And I am a bit of Heidi and a bit of Lauren.

For some reason, I'm addicted. I love it so much. I know the characters are not exactly paradigms of virtue, but they're definitely entertaining. I personally think it would have a way higher rating than 3.4 if it were not advertised as a reality show.

Overall, a total guilty pleasure."
The Hills,It's great....and by that I mean it's terrible...,"There's not much to expect out of a MTV show, especially when most of their programs targets tween to early 20's audiences.

Of course, for its purely entertainment value, you SHOULDN'T have to think too much of the program - just sit back and relax...right? But ""The Hills"" is unbearable. Period.

I decided to give it a try and watch one episode since my girlfriend has been begging me to watch it. At first, you kind of admire Lauren's maturity of wanting to go to school and create a future for herself. Then you realize that of course she would get ushered into a reputable school, get hired for a job that most girls dream and die for. It's a goddamn TV show that sets up everything to make life seem easy! And why wouldn't it? The main characters are inherently wealthy, good-looking fashionable girls with material goods 3/4's of Americans can't afford.

There's no way in hell that Heidi could've gotten hired for that job that she had - (something about being a professional events organizer?!?) without any references, or even a flippn' resume. She basically said in the interview that she has drive, is motivated to work?! What's sad is that this creates an unrealistic dream for teens.

I think I watched about 15 minutes of it, and turned it off.

I'll say this though, MTV can really market their products, and they are definitely experts at making crap look like it's worth watching...even when it isn't."
The Hills,Guilty pleasure,Will always have a special place in my heart. So easy to watch and switch off from real life. Will never get bored of it and always makes me want to jump on a plane and head to Los Angeles.

The Hills,Extremely superficial zero entertainment,"I discovered this by chance and to be honest the only reason I watched was to see what was the start of the ultra annoying reality stars Spencer Pratt and Heidi . Whom I first witnessed on the UK big brother show and had never heard of them

Super short episodes of 15 mins of same thing over and over again have no idea where Spencer makes money as have never seen him work so reality must pay big money!

Like most reality it is beyond superficial badly acted ( reality is a myth we all know this crap 💩 is scripted to within an inch of its life)

I guess if your desire in life is to be famous and rich then these shows are the ladder as they have been on every reality show they could find😂 A life fulfilled if that is their desire"
The Hills,Oh so boring!,"I've been seeing this show for the last couple of weeks and just hoping for it to get exciting or scandalous but eh this one has to be the no. 1 contender for MTV's worst show. It basically has no storyline except may be a couple of girls blabbering something about fashion, partying and of course dating. And yes it seems very very scripted... Unless you're some rich pretty blonde roaming around with cameras, its impossible to get a job that easily. The pace of the show is pretty slow and the only thing that wakes you up when you're watching this show is the music which is randomly put in between the scenes. To sum it up, I am a reality show junkie and I can tolerate almost any kind of crap thrown at me but this show is just too freakin boring. Unless you're 11 yrs old or have the maturity of a 11 yr old, you're gonna get tired of this show."
The Hills,Waste of production money and waste of teens brains,"This show has got to be the WORST by far on television. I would rather watch ""all my children"" or American idol reruns than this. Everyone knows this show isn't real, and even if it was, they live such boring lives why doesn't MTV do something useful? Like, oh, I don't know, play music? Hello! Music TV?!!?

Really I only saw about 10 minutes of it (because my friends told me I had to see it) and I swore it was the biggest load of crap. Survivor is more realistic than is!

Why are we watching shows about rich girls who have more than the need as it is while there are kids on the street in DC in NYC, there's even a genocide going on in Darfur and what are American Teens doing rather than figuring out what can be done to save the world we're living in? Watching a bunch of spoiled brats sit and eat salad and stare at each other. Seriously?

I have no understanding toward this show (or even the preceding show um Orange County?) If MTV just wants to wast money, please, buy us all a new house or something. Change someone's life for the better, don't give a TV show to a bunch of snotty brats who's biggest concern is who's dating who and why.

Waste of money, waste of brains, waste of TV."
The Hills,Real... No. Acted... Yes Scripted... Kind Of.,"OK to begin it is not real; everyone in this is an actor or actress who does not do a very good job of it. Most of the acting is just deprived because of the script. It seems that just before they film a scene or a part of an episode they will just tell the actors what to say and do because all the actions and speech is delayed or somewhat paused. There is no way in REALITY that people in L.A. or anywhere in the world would talk like this. (If you have ever seen Bryans girlfriend from family guy then she is a classic example of how all the girls act on the show.) I have never actually watched an episode from start to finish but I figured out that a fight in this REALITY is two girls chatting then one walking out the room, walking back in, then they both discuss how they feel about each other and bitch over who said what in the first place. Also a typical day is waking up, having your photographs taken for a magazine, staring in an advert or beauty show, Resting on a beach, meeting with friends, falling out over nothing anyone would in REALITY, saying sorry and making it up by having a party with no alcohol or drugs-like real teenagers in western culture.

Being English I wouldn't use the term deuce bags to describe the guys, i would call them wa****s. Again, in REALITY people don't, especially when its friend to friend don't keep using the words ""Well I feel that"" or ""I think that she feels"" it is just bulls**t and a typical example of escapism T.V. where girls with low self-esteem watch and dream of living in the hills. But as someone has also commented, these rich brats only have what they have thanks to their parents and to be fair the cast holds an average I.Q of 40 between them all."
The Hills,Not reality (or entertainment) as we know it,"Well, I tuned in, then tuned out again.

If this is real in any way, it is clearly not reality as it happens. It is fairly obvious that most of the scenes have been planned. The tracking shot as Lauren drives to Los Angeles, the ""Vogue want me there in 20 minutes"" scene and the scene where she goes to register at fashion school... actually, the last one was quite nicely shot (the camera crew might have a better future ahead). However, it lacked the verisimilitude of (say) an episode of The Osbournes or even The Simple Life. In fact, it lacked the believability of The OC or One Tree Hill!

It does come across as a cheap (bad) soap, but with acting appropriate to a porn movie.

And no-one watches a porn movie for the acting."
The Hills,"Drama, Drama, Drama!","People need to ignore the bad reviews because this show really is the best. Everyone needs to watch this show! You will get hooked straight away. It is full of drama all the time.

Yes so there has been many debates if it's scripted or not but really who cares! Just enjoy it.

You really will get addicted to this show and fall in love with the characters... Or love to hate them (Spencer of course). It has a nice mixture of drama, bitchy, fall outs but also the humour. It's a great show about relationships and friendships.

It's really nice watching a show about a nice group of friends. It's an easy to watch show.. Full of plenty of eye candy!"
The Hills,Watching the hill is a massacre,Comentario no disponible
The Hills,Non-Stop Drama (not as good as O.C.),"I was a little sceptical about ""the hills"" - a spin off from ""laguna beach"". However I (shamefully) find it extremely entertaining and many of my (male) friends do as well. Throw some hot girls, fit blokes, arguments and love into the mixer and you get a decent series to watch.

Of course it's hard to believe this is meant to be ""reality television"" because the O.C. seemed more real than this, but don't frown upon it.

Let's start off where it does lose a few stars: 1) First of all - characters as hot as they may be, unfortunately, I have found it extremely difficult to relate to any of them, where as in the O.C. different people had different characters to relate to.

2) Then sometimes, there is too much drama, and sadly it becomes less enjoyable 3) Last but not least - acting (because that's what they are doing) is terrible, all they have to do is be themselves and throw in a few quirky lines - sadly we get random stares, awkward smiles oh and did I mention awkward smiles? Now here is where I think the show does gain a few stars: 1) Awesome soundtrack - it's MTV afterall!!! I have found 10s of songs I have loved by just watching the show 2) Lauren - she is just a likable, all-trusting character (even though it's hard to relate to her) she is very nice.

3) Chemistry - I think Heidi, Lauren and Audrina are so different and yet seem so fitting as 3 friends.

4) Brody - gotta love him, the dude says it as it is.

5) Spencer - you need an antagonist and he is a worthy one.

Overall verdict: 6/10 This concept is awesome, sadly it's a bit like marmite - you either love it or you hate it. Where the show loses out is certainly being called a ""reality TV show"". Even if all of that is ""real"" there is nothing real about these people - no real problems, no real feelings - it's a fake world. Nonetheless if you want to just relax in front of TV for 20 minutes - it's easy to get swallowed up by the world of rich American kids."
The Hills,Worst show ever!!!,"I can't believe people watch this show! I couldn't stand 2 minutes watching it! Everyone on the show is so STUPID!!! All it really is these dumb girls blabbing about their relationships and boys! That is basically the whole premise of the show. If you have a life you wouldn't watch it! Sad world we live in when this is called entertainment... Just sitting around with no technology is more entertaining than the hills! There are a lot of idiotic shows on t.v, but this is worse than that. A lot of people in my school watch it and say it is a great show, but people at my school are retarded. It is a good thing nobody in my house watches this show because it would be considered torture. I think you get the point. I repeat if you have a life DO NOT watch THE HILLS!

P.S. I'm a HUGE twilight fan!!"
The Hills,Already Addicted!,"After seeing only one episode of The Hills, I am already counting down the days until the next episode. The new MTV show seems promising, and it has already brought a cliffhanger. Personally, I liked Kristin better on Laguna Beach, but it really seems like Lauren is making something with her life. It's nice to see the rich girl do something worthwhile. Of course, I'm not sure how the show will turn out to be, but so far I love it! The Hills seems like a promising sequel to the awesome show, Laguna Beach. Laguna was my favorite show, and I think that The Hills will do it proud! Can't wait to see! If you haven't already, tune into The Hills next week, you won't regret it!"
The Hills,The Will was better! hate this show.,"OMG! This show is so boring. I am into this stuff: TV shows, reality shows...but this one? Lauren has no personality she is like 88% of the girls worldwide and she can't even speak properly. She uses ""like"" in every phrase. I saw so many shows, i love to watch them but really: This one was the worst! Not to mention girls appearance...SO ordinary. Typical fake blonde girls playing ""the fashion victims"" even though they have no idea about fashion. How about Heidi's line: ""school is not for me""? How awful is this? I can't believe people say this is not scripted...it has a script but unfortunately not a good one. And those girls are too ordinary to act. You need that kind of ""something"" to make a show really work and those girls are as boring as an empty bottle. Not funny and not entertaining. 1/10.

WARNING: you can fall asleep any second."
The Hills,"Empty, stupid, meaningless, soulless","yes- it is true- MTV is a business, they make money by providing entertainment, there duty is not to educate the youth or to be moral- they are what they are and they will exist as long as there are people watching these series- they are basically satisfying a need - or perhaps they are creating one... What worries me more is that the series are appealing to so many people, which don t see it critically but are in the contrary almost obsessed with it. I mean- the characters are boring, spoil-ed and vain people, with no motivation (WHATSOEVER!!) to achieve something in life on their own, who are just pretending to live ""live the Good life"" with some drama here and there to keep the suspense up- I mean- this series are just preventing you from thinking. LIVE THE REAL LIFE INSTEAD OF WATCHING THIS FAKE S**T! I mean even if u feel the need to shut your brain off for a day and not think about anything- there are much better series out there to entertain you- I mean this series are not even funny- there are just EMPTY- no conversation, no action, just a bunch of people with no problems so bored that they have to make problems to feel somehow important... I wouldn't t give it even 1 out of 10 but that s the lowest...!"
Tabula Rasa,Slow burn mind implode,"Have never written a review before but this show deserves to be watched! It's a slow burner yes, but what a pay off in the end. Worth the viewing time. If you have watched a lot of horror/thriller/mystery you will appreciate it. The pyro guy is fun to watch along with the other 'nuts' of the asylum ward. Everyone plays their part well."
Tabula Rasa,Good suspense and very good acting,"Got all the right ingrediënts for a good thriller/suspense series. The acting is very good, indeed top-notch. The story had its flaws but come on, have you watched Strangers Things really closely? Main atraction in this Belgian series is the mood.. very creepy and .. unsettling. Try and give it 3 episodes: you're hooked."
Tabula Rasa,Slow but good,"Several episodes seem to lack luster at the beginning. I began with an expectation of supernatural involvement, and was constantly irritated at the slow development.

But, the relationships between husband and wife, the mysteries, and the emotional turmoil kept me in it. I am not easily surprised, yet this did exactly that. The end is well worth the wait. You can argue that it's unbelievable, but I don't think that comes into it. It's explanatory and dramatic. You will be hard-paced to find any single season drama that resolves so well.

The key to any resolution is that it meets some criteria: 1) It is not fantastical. It could happen without violating physical laws. 2) It has a certain bitter-sweetness. Not a requirement, but definitely helps. 3) It resolves the crisis of the main character. 4) It lets us love the character, after having had her character impuned upon throughout. It redeems her believably.

Give it a try. Relax."
Tabula Rasa,"Excellent, Binge-Worthy Thriller","Tabula Rasa is an excellent psychological thriller. The acting is top-knotch, particularly from the three lead actors: Veerle Baetens, Stijn Van Opstal, and Jeroen Perceval.

This is a show that will keep you guessing, with so many twists, layers, and hidden connections. There's a fantastic air of creepiness and menace. The imagery is stunning and the cinematography is great. My jaw dropped in shock more than once.

Aside from the intricate and compelling central mystery, the relationship drama is also great. There's nuance in the performances and the show really displays the complexity of family life. As an American, I found it fascinating to see what life in Flanders is like.

There are just so many fantastic elements to this show. It's the perfect show to bingewatch. Tabula Rasa, along with Dark, prove that some of Netflix's best content is the foreign language shows. I can't recommend Tabula Rasa enough. It's such a smart show."
Tabula Rasa,"Oh, this is a keeper","I loved it, I have gone almost exclusively to the international movies and series on Netflix, they are such a breath of fresh air after the trash of Hollywood. There are several moments in Tabula Rasa where you will stop breathing, it's that good. If you find it ""slow"" or ""boring"" as somebody is saying, you might have that ""instant gratification"" problem, too much American film long on non-stop action and short on meaning. (I am American but no lover of the film industry - either glorifying sex and violence or both together or preaching politics, I am done with them.) These foreign projects have opened new horizons for me, too - how many more times do I need to see NYC and LA, anyway. Keep it coming, I'm hooked."

Tabula Rasa,From the slow cooker to the microwave,"The premise of the show is quite interesting and similar to shows/ movies i liked e.g the sinner, memento so I decided to give it a watch.

As my title suggests the show starts of to an extreme slow start. The case is not the subject moreso the lead her life and struggle with her condition is. The cinematography is beautiful and done with an great eye for details. The story encapsulates you and the way its presented with the intertwining of dreams, memories and imaginations brings the struggle of her condition to life. But as my sympathy for several characters begins to grow my patience does the opposite.

Too many details and revelations were stuffed in the last couple minutes of the last episode, it doesn't fit with the very detailed and slow paced show that it was just a couple of minutes before.

Watching a well written, well shot psychological drama is not an punishment in any way. Yet i felt cheated when i came to the realization that they just thrown the meal i was diligently waiting for in the bin and served me a last minute pizza from around the corner instead."
Tabula Rasa,One of the best I have seen,I can easily say this series is one of the best I have seen. Initially you may find it little slow moving but last two or three episodes will shockingly surprise you. Have little bit patience and continue watching this. The series will end much better than your expectations.
Tabula Rasa,Episode 9 Though!,Comentario no disponible
Tabula Rasa,A gripping Belgian drama,"This nine part Belgian drama is centred on Annemie D'Haeze, a woman who is being held at a secure medical facility. The police believe that she holds the answers to what happened to Thomas De Geest, a man who has disappeared. Unfortunately she has no memory of him... in fact she has been unable to form new long term memories since she was involved in a car crash months earlier.

The story progresses in two time frames. In the present we see her interviewed by a policeman with a special interest in the case, talk to her psychiatrist and befriend a fellow inmate. In the months after her accident where we see her life with husband Benoit and young daughter Romy; how she comes to know the missing man and how she tries to cope with her memory loss. As the story progresses it becomes clear that many things she believed weren't true and many people are keeping secrets from her; for motives which may or may not be in her best interests.

I really enjoyed this series; the story was told in a way that drip fed us key facts before twisting many certainties... early on I wasn't even certain of its genre as well as a conventional central mystery there were even hints of supernatural elements. What happened to Thomas De Geest, suitably renamed 'Thomas Spectre' in the subtitles, was not obvious by any means and if something bad had happened to him there were plenty of suspects; these included Annemie, Benoit and a mysterious man lurking near their home amongst others. The final resolution was perhaps a little melodramatic but it was enjoyable. The cast did an impressive job; Veerle Baetens was great as Annemie; young Cécile Enthoven really impressed as Romy, especially during her character's more disturbing moments and Gene Bervoets was solid as Inspector Jacques Wolkers... to be honest I don't think there were any weak performances just some characters that stood out more than others. The way the story is told amplifies Annemie's self-doubt in a way that creates an oppressive atmosphere. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a mystery that keeps one guessing right to the end.

These comments are based on watching the series in Dutch with English subtitles."
Tabula Rasa,Minor Structural Flaws Don't Lessen The Experience,"To be fair, movies which incorporate (seemingly endless) time jumps could sometimes not only be hard to follow but structurally deficient as well. Thankfully, ""Tabula Rasa"" (""Blind Slate"") had all their ducks in a row. Obviously, a ton of plotting went into making this mystery series, As Nordic Noir goes (if it truly fits into that category), ""Tabula Rasa"" sits head and shoulders above similar titles, fitting right up there with other excellent series like""Bordertown,"" ""Depart Q"", etc. Cinematography was to die for as was the general acting. Some reviewers complained about pacing issues. I didn't mind the long drags, though. That seems to be part and parcel of Nordic Noir anyway, you know, allowing the viewer enough time to absorb the lush scenery, as it were."

Only problem?..the high speed finishing off in episode nine...real shame.

A thriller with the sort of plot twist that means its not the sort of show you could watch through twice , still..one of the more worthy offerings on Netflix."

Tabula Rasa,7.5 Great Episodes,Comentario no disponible
Tabula Rasa,So Good... for the first few episodes.,"The first episode was excellent. Acting is great, sets are terrific, story was intriguing, strong production values. In short, I was glad I'd found a new binge-worthy series.

But by episode 3, my enthusiasm was waning.

And by 4, I didn't care anymore. The story just seemed to lose momentum; the story just kept repeating endlessly to the point I just didn't care about Mei, her husband, the disappearance, nothing.

If the whole production was scaled back to a 3 or 4 episode mini-series, it might have worked. But in its present form, it was like watching grass grow."
Tabula Rasa,Intriguing,"Tabula Rasa(2017) Country-Belgium Language-Flemish Episodes-7 I have heard once from a revered critic that horror works more genuinely if the characters involved in it are developed well so that in moments of their distress, we care for them and wish them to be safe and quite seamlessly involve in their fear. Most of the horror films/series don't do this , they are incidental horrors which evokes fear but not because the characters are in distress but because the ghosts are scary. Tabula Rasa fits into the former category quiet effortlessly.

This Belgian mini-series depicts a disappearance investigation of a scrapeyard worker, whose prime suspect is our protagonist, Anne suffering from anterogade amnesia. She is admitted in a psychiatric hospital during the process. The story jogs between two narratives, her in the hospitals and the events two months before the disappearance.

Two months prior to the disappearance, Anne moved with her husband and daughter to her ancestral home in a secluded area amidst the forest. Anne starts experiencing suspicious phenomena there. Is she delusional or is there really an occult presence in the house? The script constantly confuses the audience with reasons behind both possibilities. The investigation storyline is also not overshadowed, both storylines progresses parallelly and sometimes converges to give twists.

The character of Anne is conscious of her illness and that's what pains her the most. She knows she will forget but still she is trying to be a perfect mother and wife. His husband cares for her and is extremely possessive of her wife. He has arranged everything for her wife to not fall in distress during his absence. But still he sometimes grows weary of her wife's illness and tries to give in. The imperfect characters resonates well to make the script believable. The side characters ranging from her troublesome daughter, promiscuous mother, a pyromaniac patient in the hospital gives another dimension to her character.

""The subplot character provides another opportunity to define the protagonist through comparison and advance the plot"" This above statement is justified by the following series .The side characters have their own backgrounds but it blends into Anne's narrative and broadens her role.

The film, as I already said made us care for Anne when she is in distress and having horrific visions. A mysterious house, a creepy prowler etc; the setting is perfect to the genre and it works. There are several twists ,most of them are delivered well except the last one, it seems far fetched.

The performances are great .Veerle Baetens as Anne is the heart of the series. The cinematography is great and also the dream sequences are shot well. The opening credits is beautiful."
Paradise PD,It is really entertaining and raunchy,"I thoroughly enjoyed this outrageous program. I like it more than Brickleberry (which I could not really get into). I am upset they canceled it. I have never seen such a crude show before. The crudeness was funny because, while not clever or witty, it was just so outlandishly crude that it just ended up being funny, or at least very watchable. It was easy for me to turn my mind off, relax, eat some food and watch a few episodes at a time. I like that they ripped into some politicians. It was unintelligent but so over the line that it was delightfully entertaining. The reviews of Farzar seem considerably worse. Whereas this show either gets a 1/2 or 8/9 it seems like Farzar is just getting 2s and 3s with some 7s. If you like family guy and very crude humor you will possibly like this. Enjoy!"
Paradise PD,Brickleberry and Super Troopers Love Child,"This show is as if Brickleberry and Super Troopers found Johnny Depp's briefcase stash from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas; what they did can never be spoken of and *poof* out popped their love child Paradise P.D.

Great Show!

Ignore the haters who lack a sense of humour. Probably millienials anyways"
Paradise PD,I can't help but laugh childishly,This has some of the dumbest humor and ridiculous characters.... and I love every bit of it.
Paradise PD,Very funny but sure not for everyone!,"This animated series is completely irreverent, ignores all boundaries and plows along without much caring who or what it offends. The jokes are crude, the action even more so. It's a breath of fresh air in a time of puritanical political correctness, and the fear of upsetting fellow humans. It takes the worst of life, and makes fun of it. Very enjoyable series."
Paradise PD,"I DON'T care if it's offensive, I DO care that it's not funny!","Other reviewers are mentioning this show as being very offensive, as a good or bad thing. To be honest, I know they did a lot of bathroom and sex jokes, but I don't remember it being extremely offensive or dark or anything.

Anyway, I love dark comedy. South Park is hilarious. I don't like it nearly as much any more, but Family Guy was quite funny. There's lots of other ""offensive"" shows that are funny. The problem with Paradise PD and Brickleberry is that those shows go dark but forget to make it funny. Just being dark isn't funny, even if it is ""extreme"". You have to actually be saying something or at least being funny about it.

This show just isn't funny. The voices aren't great, the animation is just OK, and the writing and humor are just total crap. It's not just bad, it's bad that's been done a million times before. Poop and fart and sex jokes you've heard in every school yard and on every street corner.

Furthermore, why does this show even exist? Brickleberry was a huge mistake and a gigantic flop that never should have been made into a series. So when that ended in an obvious trainwreck... Netflix decided to continue it? Why? Do the Brickleberry people have dirt on the Netflix board of directors or something?

Paradise PD is literally just a continuation of Brickleberry, only turning the park rangers into policemen and replacing the bear with a talking dog that is literally flat out lifted from Family Guy. I know because I watched every episode of both. Yes, I hated it, but much like a car accident, I simply couldn't look away. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on a show that seems to have been written by a grade six creative writing class who were told ""you can write as many sex and poop jokes as you want!""

Who knows what Netflix was thinking. Anyway, it doesn't matter. This show is destined to flop just like Brickleberry, and until it does, nobody has a gun to my head forcing me to watch it! But I might anyway, because... car crash."
Paradise PD,Frustrating,"I feel so sorry for Black and O'Guin; as a truly long-term fan of Brickleberry, it must have been soul-destroying for them to lose the show they loved and not be allowed to make more episodes.

So they did the next best thing and here's Paradise PD.

But the problem is: it's the same show, but the characters aren't nearly as endearing. They're all just a bit too weird and unlikeable.

The jokes are the same, but they fall flat without Ethel and Denzel to deliver them in their original Brickleberry setting. Even the walking dog, Bullet, is a pale imitation of Malloy.

I will watch all the episodes in homage to the creators, but this isn't Brickleberry 2, or even 1.1; it's a weaker show as the creators blew their load (creatively - don't be rude) on Brickleberry and this is a pale substitute.

Blame Comedy Central for not allowing further episodes to be made, OR for graciously allowing the creators to shift the show to Netflix. But that's another story for another day.

If you liked Brickleberry there's enough to enjoy here. For everyone else, it's a bit too weird and offensive and crude. It's definitely NOT for kids!!!"
Paradise PD,Brickleberry Season 4,"If you liked Brickleberry you'll like it, if you didn't you won't."
Paradise PD,like mr pickles and family guy had a baby,"Its not specifically my kinda humour, the random gross out kind, but really if youre into that kinda thing youll more than likrly love paradise pd its styles rather bland but, ya get that these days i suppose not bad, not a masterpiece either but still worth a watch, especially if you just enjoy adult animation in general"
Paradise PD,Just like Brickleberry and its great,"I used to love Brickleberry, and this show is very, very similar, just instead of a national park its a police department, and by Golly, I am a big fan of heavily offensive shows. But alas Brickleberry got canceled only after 3 seasons, which seems to be the cutoff age for such shows (see Drawn Together...) Sooo, my fear is this show, being equally offensive, will again not last for very long, even though its on Netflix, who aren't as concerned with the outrage of snowflakes as TV stations.

But other than that, its a pretty fun show - offensive, hella funny, so I wholeheartedly recommend it."
Paradise PD,I'm not saying it's not stupid or unoriginal but I like it.,"So, yeah, it's Brickleberry. This is Brickleberry Season 4.

Not literally, but I'm not exactly exaggerating. Many characters can be corresponded; Both shows has a toxically masculine hard ass in charge, both have an obese person who is a magnet for ridicule. Both have a a talking animal who spends most of their time indulging base desires etc...

I'm not saying I don't like it though. This show, like Brickleberry, is nostalgic for a time where cartoons were either just for kids or adults only, with no inbetween (except the Simpsons obviously).

It's a torrent of crass, gross and disturbing humor and it's wonderfully inventive with it. Cool stories and an uncompromisingly brutal narratives make this a guilty pleasure.

As someone cynical about cops, I love making fun of them.

They tried having a story arc about a new drug and a secretive kingpin. It's actually pretty fun and there is plenty on self contained stuff in each episode to stop it from getting dull."
Paradise PD,An Honest Review,"From the people that brought you Brickleberry we have yet another cartoon with a good premise, one that starts off fine...

....and then slowly falls apart as starts to think it is funnier than it actually is.

It's trying to be the offensive Rick & Morty, South Park, and Family Guy...but forgets that it really needs to satire society for their jokes to land."
Paradise PD,It's Brickleberry and no one cares if you think it's lazy!,"Brickleberry ended too soon. I loved every second of it. So for all the tired half-men that want to cry all over your reviews like this isn't the best thing ever, get bent. The only thing this show is missing is Tosh, Natasha Leggero, and the black guy that played Denzel. I love this continuation of our favorite Park Rangers. Kinane is a wonderful addition, Chalke is just as off-rail as everyone, and I love all the revivals of the old characters from the Park. I love this show and will fight the critics left and right."
Paradise PD,All good things must come to an end,"This adult cartoon follows a depraved bunch of dodgy police officers. There's definitely a good chuckle to be had in the first 10 episodes. It really goes downhill after that and you're left wondering why the writers/producers think we should keep tuning in.

The humour is absolutely toilet humour. It lacks the originality and innovation that South Park has and each moment feels like a desperate jump to make the viewer laugh through shock value. Ultimately, the show fails and doesn't deliver any unifying message or storyline. Therefore, I would suggest only watching if you're feeling absolutely brain dead."
Paradise PD,Odd funny moment but largely monotonous,Got the occasional laugh out of me but large periods were just completely finless one of the hardest series I've found to make it to the end. Would make sure you've got something else to do alongside it.
Paradise PD,Good show overall,"Overall I would say that this show is pretty funny and entertaining. The writing the entire show is outstanding and phenomenal but in season 4 I just didn't like the plot. I think the writing was still good I just didn't like how it lacked to show the PD even though the show had PD in its name. At first I was interested in the change up but at the end I thought the idea wasn't it. It still had great jokes and great writing and I enjoyed the entire show, just wish there could be a season 5. Oh well! Loved the show and loved brickleberry but not the new one farzar!!!!!!!!!!!! Paradise PD 10/10!!"
Paradise PD,Seen this before,"This show isn't bad, but it's not as good as what it's trying to recreate. They Should have just brought back Brickleberry. Paradise PD is just a less funny version of that."
Paradise PD,Brickleberry continued.,"Excellent show, which if you've seen brickleberry and were gutted they got cancelled? REJOICE, with Paradise PD you can appreciate the ""similar"" recurring characters like Bobby, the doctor...etc, the humour and most of the voices we know and love! This is a massive two fingers to those who decided to cancel Brickleberry and continue it in another way. Excellent characters, brilliant setting and perfect humour. Fantastic work I really hope season two and onwards have been ordered!!!!!"
Paradise PD,Just another Comedy Series.,"The animated Netflix comedy Paradise PD is aimed at an adult audience and tells the story of a group of police officers, all of whom don't take the law too seriously. As ""bad cops"" they would like to come across as really cool. At the end of the day, however, they have to admit that ""Bad"" simply has to be translated as bad and pathetic in their case, because every mission ends in disaster.

""Paradise PD"" is quite OK if you like excessive fecal humor and can amuse yourself about it for hours.

Even though there seems to be a lot of inspiration from ""Family Guy"" here, the series doesn't even come close to matching it. The jokes are just too dull for that.

Paradise PD had its moments, but nothing more.

I'm not eagerly waiting for a new season."
Paradise PD,If your uptight and no sense of humor move on,"Great show. I recommend it. Paradise PD, Robot Chicken, Squidbillies, Family Guy. The best of adult cartoons and cutting edge humor."
Paradise PD,"Good show, yet still tries too hard","Nowadays every adult cartoon show tries to find their niche. Some achieve truly iconic status, such as Rick and Morty, Family guy or Southpark. Most of others can't get there, so they keep on trying new things. It feels as this show niche is being anti-PC (which is good), shock humor, which mainly focused on sex stuff. While it's still decent and gives you a few laughs, sometimes it feels as they try too hard to get some shock-laughs, even when it doesn't feel as they should be there. There is a clear decline in quality from season 1, yet I would like to see what will happen further down the road. Update from 03/13/2021. It got an absolute turn to the worse with all the characters at season 3. Toilet humor had never been so ""toilety"". The intelligence that was present occasionally in the first and less in second seasons was gone. It got all over the place and the plot became dumb to say the least. But still with all the ""tolerate garbage"" that is being released out there, it's commendable that the creators aren't afraid of that ""Cancel culture"" and at least try to create something other then unwatchable cr... So keep it up. Wish you'd find a successful formula eventually."
Paradise PD,Gross and super unfunny,"No story, really bad and lazy jokes, sometimes just gross. I normally like adult animation, but this ""show"" is just so bad. Please do me a favor and don't waste your time on this."
Paradise PD,These bad reviews are almost as funny as the show.,"Maybe I am giving the bad reviews here too much credit, but they are pretty hilarious. There were obvious similarities between Paradise PD and Brickleberry. For me, it was a treat to hear some of the same voices that made Brickleberry so funny.. In my opinion, Netflix is a much better platform for this kind of show. Brickleberry would have been way better if they could have gotten away with what they are getting away with with Paradise PD."
Paradise PD,Brickleberry 2.0,Comentario no disponible
Paradise PD,Just because it's offensive doesn't mean it's cool or funny,This show SUCKS it tries so hard to be funny but it's not don't waste your time on this It's so irrelevant that they have to use Johnny Depp to get some attention by trying to making him an abuser when he was the one being abused by his wife ... like at least make fun of something that actually happened Ugh attention seekers.
Paradise PD,hilarious to the bone!,This may be the Family guy replacement we need. Brickleberry was funny. But they really upped their game on Paradise PD. Right from the start I fell in love with it. And since I first saw it I gotta say its really grown on me. So if you got Netflix and thinking about watching it then do it! No question about it. Its worth it.

The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Not recommended...,"If you're a fan of the original, than I would keep away or lower your expectations for the reboot. I'm sure it could seem funny for someone who hasn't seen the original, but for anybody that has seen it, like myself, it was quite the let down..."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Enjoyed this so much!,"This series is so funny and satisfying, stress reliever as well, love the tandem of Yuri and Sunghoon, their chemistry is really good, I love it ❤"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,"if you said this funny, watch the original!",Can't beat lee kwang soo and jung so min. they perfect couple in original series. You will be surprised and entertained by cameos from famous Korean stars on original series.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,So funny!,"I haven't watched the original series so I don't know if it's better or worse... however I just love this show- it's funny, and it doesn't shy away from immature humour which is lovely! I also love the fashion, they're dressed ridiculously well for a comedy show.

So basically this show is about a Korean web toon artist that has some popularity in the net due to his stories about his crazy family, fortunately the family is just as crazy as the series he creates. Expect a lot of over the top humour. Although this series doesn't shy away from drama either but it's not the focus of this series, neither does it follow a specific arc... it's just a funny show about the daily life of an artist. The only thing that I do not like, which is a bit nitpicky I guess but every segment of the show ends with the same K-pop song which just doesn't fit the series at all haha. Anyways go watch it if you love slapstick humour with a heart!

I'm also kind of curious as to why no one has rated this series yet! It's just really good! And it's on Netflix so if you have it, watch watch watch!"
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Not sure about it,Not a fan of this reboot. At least they could have kept the cast same.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,I like this drama a lot.. As i am a big fan of sung hoon & always looking for his new dramas,Its so much funny. & sung hoon try to give his best.. I love this drama indeed.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Extremely Disappointing,"The original cast was way better and way more funnier than this version, extremely disappointing."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Wow!!,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I' ve laughed so much during the series. Wonderful comedy. It' s a rare gift. Beautiful acting."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Terrible reboot,"I don't know why but they decided to change the entire cast which was a terrible idea because now the show is very lackluster. The original is hilarious and the lead and supporting roles do a great job of delivering the jokes this new cast though isn't so great, you can't switch out a funny lead for a guy that's not funny at all, and the storyline sucks, I couldn't get past episode one."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Funny but the original cast was better,It is still a very funny drama but can't compare to the original series.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,the original was the better one,"I'm extremely disappointed, the original was way more funnier than this.. why do you have to replace the cast...I was expecting this show to be funnier."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Just awful compared to the Original,"I watched the reboot on Netflix right after watching the original. And so very disappointed. :( It's bad enough that they entirely changed the original cast, but the people who have replaced the original lead actor and actress. They are both so annoying and doesn't really make me like or want to continue to watch them.

The lead male playing Cho Seok. So many things wrong over there. For one he lacks that authenticity as a human being and instead in his acting, constantly over exaggerate when doing his (childish) personality. It's very hard to ever emphasize with him and dude is just a horrible unappealing actor trying too hard to copy the (original) character. The lead female is also not really refreshingly different but just adopting a similar uninspiring personality.

The storyline and jokes are also not as funny as the original was. It's just desperately trying to rehash the same old fart and poop scenes, but it's somewhat way more predictable and not very creative. I liked how the original series felt more intensely vulnerable and real. Whereas this series just seems more like a poorly made cheap caricature of the original cast..

After watching a few episodes, I already feel bored and not really wanting to go torture myself into continuing to watch. With the original series, it felt there were feelings of genuine relatedness, despite the family being dsyfunctional and the storyline felt magical and original in the best way. This reboot is so disappointing after watching the original series.

Maybe I miss the old cast but I really gave this series a real chance to win me over. But I just can't seem to enjoy watching this. It doesn't compel me to feel deeply for the characters like the original. Instead it just mostly annoys me and why it gets 4 stars and that is actually me being generous, simply because maybe it is just difficult to replicate the original series' s success and my expectations, right before watching this series, was already set high. I gave ten stars to the original series.

Basically if you like me, have already watched the original series. You will likely be disappointed like me to go watch this reboot..not happy at all. :( I only gave it a chance because I was so impressed by the original series. But this reboot version just ruined the whole thing for me. :( TT."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,The cast really tried. Blame netflix for this disastrous attempt of a sequel,First off Why if netflix was going to do a re-boot 2 years later did they not just extend the original for another 2 seasons? This was the major problem. They picked the wrong cast for this one. They really tried but could not duplicate the original cast. The male actor that played cho seok was too cool didn't look dumb enough like the original. The actress that played Ae-Bong was too sexy and always had her way even when she was mad she looked sexy not like the original one who looked vunlerable and niave and had her own mishaps at the hands of cho seok. The mother was also too sexy as well as ae bong's mother. The father looked to old and the brother didn't look dumb enough like the original. The 2 stars that I gave was one star for the sexy actresses and the other star for the cute little baby. Other than that I really didn't laugh much at all like in the original series. The mother in the original looked really like a mom. They tried but didn't suceed. I really can't recommend this after watching the original. Sorry.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Mine was broken by this awful series,"I love Sung Hoon - he is such a sexy attractive guy. I watched him in ""My Secret Romance"" and was instantly captivated by his charisma.

Alas - I decided to watch this simply because of my hero.

From the outset it was simply awful - the actors were dreadful, except Sung Hoon of course - and the comedy - hang on - there has to be another word for what this is - it certainly bears no relation to funniness - it was as if a five year old child had written it and a four year old had directed it.

I haven't been so disappointed in a Korean series for many a year.

I keep on wondering why anybody read the script and decided to participate in it. I guess the paycheck is the answer.

Guys - reputation is more important.

Enough said."
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Aweful,This reboot second season is so awful. I feel like the show really let everyone down. Its not even good writing. The acting is so boring and bland. The characters have no personality. Its just really awful. It almost hurts to watch.
The Sound of Your Heart: Reboot,Not worth it,Don't waste your time. It's not worth watching. Worst Korean show I've ever seen.

To the Lake,A Surprisingly Excellent Pandemic Thriller,"I had been looking for something new to watch, and randomly stumbled on a blog post gushing about this show. I decided to give it a shot, and could not stop watching over the course of 2 days.

If someone asked me to describe this show, I would say that it is a mix of ""28 Days/Weeks Later"" (2002, 2007) and ""Contagion"" (2011), with a uniquely Russian flair mixed in. I have never been exposed to a Russian producton before, and this show certainly set the bar high.

""To the Lake"" follows an unlikely group of survivors as they attempt to battle their way out of Moscow, fleeing from a deadly virus that kills everything in its path within 3-4 days. The virus itself is shrouded in mystery, but the concept reminded me a lot of the aformentioned movie ""Contagion"". There are no zombies or supernatural entities found here; just a bleak depicition of mother nature's most efficient killing tool as it runs unchecked throughout Russia and beyond. I really appreciated this approach, and in my opinion, the show has a more realistic feel when compared to other pandemic shows that came before it (one AMC show in particular comes to mind...).

The editng and camera work were often reminiscent of the ""28 Days"" series, with hard cuts and shaky camera shots to help emphasize the horror and confusion of the situation. The cinematography was also excellent, and included some breathtaking shots of Russia's wilderness.

I only have a few minor gripes with the show. While the acting is excellent, there are moments where characters make some rather bewildering choices. My second issue is with the music; there are times where it feels out of place, or perhaps doesn't have the emotional impact that was intended. There are also times where the music is excellent, and reminded me (again) of the ""28 Days"" movies. Overall, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

With that being said, I definitely recommend this show. It's intense and bleak, but also has a uniquely human element to it that can be hard to capture in shows like this. If you like post apocalyptic movies/shows, definitely check this one out. For English speakers, I highly recommend watching this show in Russian with subtitles."
To the Lake,A decent film version of the great novel,"I adore thrillers both in films and in literature. Furthermore, the scarier, the better for me. It is not a surprise that I fell in love with Yana Vagner's novel - Vongozero. For me it was an ultimate page turner, I literally couldn't tear myself from the book and binge-read it in three days.

Some time ago I heard about the series based on the novel. Unfortunately, I couldn't watch it among the first. But finally, I found an opportunity to dive into my favorite Universe and would like to share my first impressions with you. Some directors deliberately change a lot in the movie version and that often ruins the author's concept. In the case of this series the novel is treated very delicately.

Many characters and especially Anna look exactly the same as I imagined while reading the story and it's the best gift for all the fans of this novel, including me. Writing this text, I am wondering - how could have this book become a prediction of 2020!

The scariest part of both the book and the show is - that there are no zombies, no walking deads, yet it gives you the chill when you recognize these omens of our NEW NORMAL in it. And it takes courage to watch this series nowadays."
To the Lake,Outstanding,"Never thought this will be so good.. Started watching this as i dont have anything to watch in Netflix .. Thought it will be like another zombie movie but man it takes things on a different level..

Will definitely wait for the season 2.."
To the Lake,Enjoyable - season 1,"I do love an end of the world/rampant virus/people going nuts type of drama, it has to be said. So this was right up my street.

I watched it dubbed, so I probably didn't get the best of it, but it was enjoyable all the same.

A bit of a culture shock in places. We Brits just don't tend to have that much nudity in our dramas! And, did it need so many boobs? Probably not, but hey, they were all cracking boobs!

I did get a bit tired of it halfway through, but after a few weeks off came back to it and I'm glad I did. The set up for the second season looks great. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Netflix to add it.

There's no spoilers here, but I will warn that there's a fair bit of sexual violence, albeit more threatened, than fully executed. I presume it goes back to the cultural thing.

And for anyone just wanting gore and action, I'd suggest you give it a try but know that this is more about the characters (even if they don't make that much sense - again, I'll assume the cultural difference).

Overall a solid series.

I'm so glad I don't live in the snow! I'll take constant drizzle any day! I'd have frozen to death on day one."
To the Lake,I am so bored of generic Hollywood Stuff,"This show is worth the watch, I'd give it an 8, the reason I gave it a 10 is to counter the 1 star reviews. It's not perfect but I love the interactions and how human the characters are ( or in other words how real ), acting good and hope we see more TV shows from Russia and other countries that don't see the US as the entire planet."
To the Lake,Russian Pandemic Thriller,"To The Lake: Virus runs rife, people coughing and dropping dead, you can tell they're infected by the reds of their eyes, so don't shot until you can see that. Moscow is sealed off, a plague city. Law and order breaks down, security units start looting. A group try to journey to a lake where they hope to find refuge on an island. Internal tensions in the group doesn't help. Quite violent with disturbing scenes. Interesting to see a Russian pandemic TV Series. On Netflix. 7/10."
To the Lake,I'm not a bot when I say this tv series is good !,"I've read the reviews , and some of them are rating this tv series 1 star , probably they wanted a zombie fight every 2 minutes ! , if you looking for that this is not for you ! . I watch a lot of movies and tv series , I know when something is worth watching and this is one of them ! - The story is great , sometimes looks like the characters made stupid bad decisions , but if you put yourself into that character you realize that the action they took is quite plausible.

People often make stupid decisions when are under stress or some cases !

The acting is really good I felt every character honorable mention to Polina ,Lyonya , and worked well with the story ! -

I do recomand this tv series , in my opinion is very good !"
To the Lake,Russian Version of The Walking Dead meets Metro Exodus (3rd entry in the Metro video game series).,"My review for Season 1 and 2.

Premise of the show is heavily influenced by post-apocalyptic horror dramas and movies like ''The Walking Dead'', ''Fear The Walking Dead'', ''28 Weeks Later'', ''Dawn Of The Dead'' etc and the video game, Metro Exodus (2019). Unknown contagious virus spreads worldwide and is declared a pandemic by the governing authorities. The Outbreak causes the collapse of society, which results in the end of modern civilization and the near extinction of the human race. Random group of survivors coming together to beat the odds of survival. Each character in the show brings along a past history of their former lives that ends up indirectly affecting other survivors. The group travels from one region of Russia to another. Nobody ever catches a real break in this show. Danger always lurk in the corner. Feels like a thriller. Overall, I enjoyed both Seasons. I hope there's a Season 3."
To the Lake,Pretty good evenings entertainment,"I admit to binge watching this, after the first episode I was hooked and wanted to see what happend to them , yes there are some cheesy moments and some bad decisions but people faced with life and death decisions under great stress do not always act rationally personally I enjoyed it and look forward to a season two"
To the Lake,Very good first season and amazing acting,At first i didnt know ehat to expect from a russian production but it was actually a very good series. Th first half of the season was kind of null with some dumm desicions and post apocalyptic cliches but the last 3-4 episodes were really amazing. Also the acting in this is really good from nearly every cast member. Amd of course a great cliffhanger whitch makes you wanna wait for the nxt season.
To the Lake,Russians can make it work even better than Hollywood,"I was being sceptical before watching the first episode, but when I turned it on, I was vastly surprised! It doesn't only have a great storyline, it also has a fabulous cast and setting(s). You can feel that the characters develop emotions for one another. There's hatred, love, sympathy, but most importantly, there's hope and trust. You can literally learn from this show and know that if we ever have to face an epidemic like that, you'll have to be able to not only adapt to the changes around you, but also have the ability to trust the ones that can and should be trusted.

Anyways, I am giving this series a 9/10, I would give it a 10 if a few more families were involved, it would have been more ""diverse"". Really recommend this show to anyone that loves post-apocalyptic movies etc."
To the Lake,Third Russian show I watch,"Watched The Sniffer and Better than us before and totally loved them! This is playing in the same league. Amazing how they combine tragedy and horror with sudden humorous scenes - I've been laughing so hard, I love it! Actors are really good, kudos to all of them!"
To the Lake,None of of them would've made it out alive on the first day,Comentario no disponible
To the Lake,The Walking Red,"It feels a little got lost in translation with the subtitles, leaving a few plot holes and flat jokes, and some of the music is dangerously close to the 28 days Later theme as well (and wow they sure love that Teach Me Tiger song a little too much!) but all in all pretty solid writing and acting and some really fantastic camera work, and the timeliness of the whole epidemic scenario makes for a binge-worthy watch. The pacing is a little slow but it's a refreshing change from the onslaught of ""Teenagers vs. the Apocalypse"" type shows."
To the Lake,One of the best,"I've seen all top imdb thriller tv-shows and this one is one of the best. Never expected something this good from Russian cinematography. It's really worth watching, hope that season 2 is coming soon! Well done 👏👏👏"
To the Lake,Poor Sergei Married The Two Most Annoying Chicks in Russia,The shows not bad. Except for the annoying banter between the two women. I'd say Ira is the worse of the two. They just break Sergei's balls the whole time. Poor guy. At least they're good looking.
To the Lake,Very-very good!!!,"One of the best mini-series that have ever came from Russia yet. Intriguing, real, with vivid and believable roles. Great production and soundtrack. Looking forward to see new movies/series from this director and his team."
To the Lake,Pretty good,"Overall a pretty good show, sort of post apocalypse meets a bunch of useless people running around Russia. Interesting storylines, if not always logical ones, and decent acting."
To the Lake,To the Lake,"This Russian series opens as news breaks of a new plague; those who have it are highly infectious and will die within days of catching it. In an attempt to stop it spreading the authorities lockdown Moscow. Sergey lives with his new wife and her son, who has Asperger's Syndrome forty kilometres from the city; at his father's suggestion they decide to evacuate to an island on a remote lake. First he must rescue his young son, and his ex-wife, from the city. On their journey they are joined by their neighbours and their teenage daughter. Along their way they meet various other people; some of whom are helpful and others who present a danger... the military are definitely in the latter category.

When I saw this series recommended on Netflix I thought it would be a zombie-type film with the infected attacking people... it is nothing like that. The only real danger the infected provide is the fact that they are so contagious. The real danger is other survivors. Our group of protagonists is interesting as they aren't particularly heroic; they are better than most people they meet but aren't above taking advantage of others they meet. The military types are particularly menacing; this is emphasised by the fact that we never see their faces as they are all masked. The locations add to the atmosphere with long snow covered roads though near-endless forest. The cast does an impressive job making us believe in the characters and their predicament. The conclusion is clearly sets things up for a second season... I hope it gets made and isn't lost to our own pandemic. Overall I'd definitely recommend this.

These comments are based on watching the episode in Russian with English subtitles."
To the Lake,"Pretty good, enjoyable","Yes its pretty good and enjoyable.

The survival part is fine. And the characters are well done. (I have to say they are one of the worst survival groups, but that is fine because not all of us are prepared to face a situation like this, and it is part of what they want to show)

I liked the Russian side of the situation. Yes watch it."
To the Lake,"First time watching a ruskie series, it's worth your time(edit GET INVESTED, WE GOT S2 COMIN :D)","It is a series where at certain points you have to turn your critical brain off and just accept some of the stupid decisions made by the characters. But you believe in there decisions because the acting is really great. So you buy into that fact that most of the characters are seriously flawed people and wont act rationally like you think you would in there situation.

I love Science fiction, but this is apocalypse horror fiction. Not really science fiction.. especially since we are experiencing a pandemic currently (hopefully that line doesnt age well...)... For all we know a proper epidemic could happen in our life time... where a good chunk of people on the planet die... Its not really space ships or aliens coming to visit... it's a reality that could happen.

They don't make the infected zombies or any reused crud like that. Its just people that get very sick and die very quickly. It's believable and is done really well.

My only complaint is the silly softcore scenes and hilariously bad music when they occur with the young kids... They seemed really out of place. If they took out that music and set the mood differently.. changed a bit of the dialogue to not be so corny... then those scenes would've fit within the seriousness of the rest of the series much better. Sure people want to bang when they think the end it near.. But you don't need to make a point of it so often in 8 episodes.. It's like they were trying to outmatch game of thrones.. but with awful music.

Anyway. Besides that complaint I really enjoyed everything else about this series. Especially the complex mix of characters and there opposing personality types, it keeps the series interesting between telling the over arching story of the world being taken over by a epidemic (and possibly a foreign force taking advantage of that)"
To the Lake,Russian Walking Dead without Zombies,"Loved it, If you enjoyed The Walking dead until it became Rubbish you will enjoy this.

But Directors please take note , if you leave your headlights on in a parked car without the engine running it will destroy your battery in roughly 1 hour especially when its cold....... I'll get me coat."
To the Lake,Looked promising at first...,First 2-3 episodes were interesting and looked like it could be a great show..but then..wow.. so many strange script choices...
To the Lake,Interesting,"Interesting idea, nice execution At first i thought it's another virus series but it's rather interesting. Nice plot, really nice scenery (snowy russia) , good acting , thus you can easily binge watch it . Give it a try. It worths the try."
To the Lake,A Fantastic Show From Russia. A Must Watch!!,"Wow, I'm glad I clicked on this by pure fluke on Netflix. Really good story and excellent cast. Moments of horror and lil' bits of humour here and there. You really get on the side of these people trying to reach their destination thru a disease ravaged land, whilst trying to avoid the military who couldn't care who lived or died. Yet again, a really good looking cast amongst the women ( ahem...) and it's great to see the Russian makers aren't afraid of nudity, with the brief full frontal blimps. (Punches a fist into the air).... Only 8 episodes and to be honest I watched episodes 4 to 8 one after the other cos I was so engrossed. Catch the trailer and I promise you will be hooked."
"My Lover, My Killer","A watchable series, but yes there are issues.","A very dry look at six cases of murder, where the victim was murdered by someone that supposedly loved them.

I found the crimes themselves very interesting, some really powerful interviews with family members and loved ones.....and some interviews by so called experts, some of them are interesting, one of them however is dismal, the most interesting episode, is the one about Peter Morgan, it is spoiled by an incredibly biased so called expert.

It's very dry, compare this to an American series, and it may seem a little reserved, perhaps less dynamically produced, definitely less by way of sensationalism, maybe not quite so entertaining.

I found some of the stories so sad, but intriguing to watch.

I would say that if more are planned, there needs to be greater impartiality by the experts.

Watchable, 7/10."
"My Lover, My Killer","Very middle of the road retelling, but I think the reviews are the criminals here","I know British documentaries are much different from American documentaries but in this case there is just so much redundancy and so little new information to take up the entirety of each episode. It's really not about British being more reserved, this is sadly just very mundane and reiterates itself over and over. Sad for the victims. I think it's very hard to understand not only the behavior of a stalker or someone of that kind of controlling nature that ends up murdering you because they can't control their emotions but it's equally hard to understand the lack of action from the friends and family who saw the danger far ahead of time. You just can't really know what you would do in such a situation although it's very easy to judge them and wonder why they didn't take some action especially the red-haired girl. The reviews I find intriguing and upsetting, if I can be honest. Who are all these people calling this a woke documentary series and saying that it's sexist? Are they saying that because the murderer was not put in a good light that the show is showing favoritism toward the victim? I think those people need some psychological counseling and I hope that they are not the next stalker. It's absolutely incredulous to me to read reviews that are upset that the perpetrator was shown in an unfair light. I mean the very notion that you should somehow be fair in describing or demonstrating the perpetrator is so mind-boggling that I'm at a loss for words."
"My Lover, My Killer",Middle of the road true crime documentary series,"The cases themselves are fairly interesting, given a very detailed build-up to the eventual murder so you can really get a feel for the people involved and the narrator does a good job of tying everything together but there often lacks detail of how the actual event transpired (understandable as only the killer knows what happened in each case but it sort of glosses over it in some cases, just simply a they killed them and that's it).

There are other issues which lead me to give this a middle of the road rating. Firstly it can be quite repetitive, often repeating quotes or rehashing the story (presumably because it was made for advert breaks and there aren't any on netflix) and the portrayal of the killer/victim seems very biased and one sided. Always describing the victim as innocent and the killer as out of control or psychopathic which may be the case but no way as black and white as this documentary implies."
"My Lover, My Killer",Repeating/Rambling interviews.,"The interviews are painful to watch, filled with useless information and one expert repeated himself continously just rephrasing his sentence over and over. Badly edited and put together what could be put in a 25min to 30min episode is dragged out with useless information while concluding information is just brushed over and ignored. This applies to all the episodes."
"My Lover, My Killer",Limited. All hearsay and third partys.,"It's all just photos over and over the same ones. Pictures of the area and then people sat, talking Only watched episode one.

Why not show their texts? Why not show the photos where they were on hol?

Makes interesting stories really boring it needs more of this rather then speculation and hearsay."
"My Lover, My Killer",Really surprised by poor ratings,"Maybe it's because most people watching don't understand stalking behaviour. Of course the series is biased towards the victims, they were brutally murdered! My goodness! They didn't deserve to be stabbed multiple times. Makes me wonder about some of these reviewers, seriously. I think the series does a good job of showing the helplessness and guilt of the families. Nobody wants something like this to happen to their loved one, all of the victims were very young (one killed at 20 years old). I also think it does show how these toxic relationships begin and the red flags to look for....but that could have been flushed out more. I wish they had an expert who really delved into the psychology of stalking and maybe what victims and families can do other than feel helpless. Clearly police need to be able to do more as well. I am just glad several of these families have set up charities and trying to help others, bringing something positive out of something so horrific."
"My Lover, My Killer",Why is this in the top 10 on my netflix,"I found the people who were interviewed were either biased or prejudiced.

Now i only watched the first two episodes but this is the first show in at least two years that have me mad!

The first was told like the directer was a supporter of the taleban. No understanding that the woman was forced to mary. & he could have let her go with dignity for both of them, but he did not.

The seconded episode was just as bad, but it was just a western way of trying to own a woman!

I don't want to watch anymore because no person should hear people blame a woman for trying to get out of a relationship. If you sham her for religion or force her to stay because you have given money to her. You need to get your head checked because that is evil & it is more pathetic, sad & evil & may I mention again pathetic!"
"My Lover, My Killer",too one sided/ no one is unbiased,"Now ive only seen the first 2 episodes of season 2,m.

The first was decent, but the family/friends/prosecutors are very repetitive and don't do a great job of making you understand the people/places/situations in the least. Also i found this series to be very dry so far. Yay the second episode i found to be ridiculous i had to button down and force myself through the episode. The guy is just as bad as the girl. He is a drinker and a drug user.. from where i'm sitting they are the same.. i understand she did some bad stuff at the end, but seriously this isn't the type of murder you show case and act like he was an angel just caught in a bad cycle. So was she. It's just not a good look the way they are beating how much she drank into the ground and acting like she's trash when he was doing the same EXACT thing. Also she can get an abortion if she wants and she should have seeing as how she couldn't support another child with how her life was going and neither could he. He didn't even have any custody with his child what does that say about him. The uk stuck in the dark ages if they look at single moms wrong but single ESTRANGED fathers like it's not their fault.

I can't watch anymore, i like myself too much. Just no, no- absolutely not."
"My Lover, My Killer",true crime,"The story is well described, CCTV footage, there are psychologists analyzing the mental state. Could have more real details like message exchange etc."
"My Lover, My Killer",Raging misogyny,"An incredibly misogynistic bias in the re-telling of murders, representing only the positive opinions of friends/family of those that committed the murder, and portraying the VICTIMS in incredibly negative light. So bad it's like watching a spoof documentary made by Mr Misogyny. Unfortunately not though, and my heart goes out to the friends and families of the victims that have already gone through such trauma.

Have the creators been living under a rock and missed the horrific effects misogyny has on lives? Really missed the mark here and I hope they are able to do some learning."
"My Lover, My Killer",It needs a massive improvement,Comentario no disponible
"My Lover, My Killer",Why the sympathetic tone towards Peter Morgan the murderer,Turned off after episode 2 given it's blatantly biased and ridiculous attempt to make it seem like the poor old murderer had no choice but to kill her the wicked woman. Why was there no one to speak from Georgina's perspective? Peter Morgan was dumb enough to think he could buy love. Why on earth would a 25year old escort fall in love with that cheating crusty old ugly goat? This scenario is as old as time. His shameless brother and those useless experts actually tried to paint him in a good light after premeditated murder. Disgusting and pathetic. If he was being blackmailed he should have gone to the police. Documentary makers should be ashamed of themselves for this episode.
"My Lover, My Killer",Unprofessional people completely sexist,Comentario no disponible
"My Lover, My Killer",No Diversity in the stories,There is a serious lack of diversity in the story telling. I understand that this is a UK series but would you have us to believe there wasn't one story of color that could have been told? I am into all things true crime from various perspectives viewpoints. I get that crimes against people of color are often down played and often have a lack of mainstream media presence. Though this show on the second season featured on Netflix does not cover any POC is highly problematic. It disturbs me that in this day and age there is still these biased methods of stories played out in documentaries still have a platform.
"My Lover, My Killer",Needs improvement,Comentario no disponible
"My Lover, My Killer",Potentially good series ruined by woke nonsense.,"Had to turn it off after episode 2, it was just too much nonsense to take. Girl exploits man for money, man exploits girl for sex... Girl is a perfect angel, man is an evil 'cis' male that needs to be thrown from a roof!

Murder, meh! Who cares about that, crime of being male is MUCH worse! If it hadn't been for the last 5 mins, I wouldn't have even recalled he killed anyone, however, I knew he was a bad male person, for bad man stuff, so needed to die!

The sad thing is, the idiots they get in to analysis the killers are so muddled up by their own issues, they never get anywhere near to actually discussing the topics at hand.

TBF, it might actually get better, but I am done. If you want to watch it, then start at e03."
"My Lover, My Killer",Absolutely foul,Comentario no disponible
"My Lover, My Killer",Very Poor,"A very poor series, only watched the first two episodes of series one. Terrible.

Badly produced and edited, along with some embarrassing tacky metaphorical scenes.

The way the episodes are put together are very dramatised, to the point that I wasn't convinced everything that was said was true either by family and friends, or the ""experts""

Many of these talking heads offer no real substance, and a lot of what they say either states the obvious or comes across as very speculative and hearsay.

Episodes are way too long, a lot of padding with repetitive scenes and photos, they could easily reduce to 30 minutes, but still wouldn't be any good."
"My Lover, My Killer",When and how they got murdered,"All these couples are made for each other. All the relationships are toxic and started off from the opposite of what love relationships should be. Feel sorry for their families, friends and the marital partners who got dragged and still believed their loved ones were the victims from the beginning. Definitely no. I continued watching the series to see where the point they got murdered and how. That's all."

Nicely narrated and beautifully crafted .. a very compelling and a must see... so next time when you are rustling up with your toque blanche, without a doubt everything that goes into your kitchen pan will earn your appreciation and respect... available on Netflix."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",A well researched show...,It is inarguably one of the best food documentaries I've ever watched
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Pleasant and compelling viewing,Great pleasure in watching this history of food in different parts of India. Amazing to know some of our current cuisines date thousand years back. Wonderful presentation !
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Cinematic brilliance!!,Every single frame is so beautiful. The shoot is amazing so is the story and mouth watering food. It wouldn't be wrong to call it a cinematic brilliance!!!
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Cinematic brilliance,"As an Indian, a self identified Foodie and a history buff, it doesn't get much better than this show. Amazing history of India told through food, traditions, the royal kingdoms and geography. Truly poetic monologues and captive cinematography tie this documentary together in the most authentic bow. Amazing work by the team of producers and artists, great talent. Can't wait to see what other work they put out next!!"
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Best depiction of Indian cuisine ever in a documentary,"Truly loved the composition and story telling of Indian cuisine originating from different states. Being a delhite, liked that episode a lot but rest other episodes were also remarkably put together in a documentary. It is well worth the time for someone fond of Indian food."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan","Love the food, history, hate the dubbing!!","When some people speak in English, it's retained and hindi sub-titles are shown, but in other cases where the people speak english are dubbed to hindi!"
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Amazing depiction of indian culture,"Such a good show, so many stories and historical facts narrated using food as the backdrop. A must watch for every Indian and every foodie. The whole show covers almost all the states from north to south and east to west. The best episode is the episode on Delhi."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",One the best food shows ever!,"The show is so brilliantly research. It not only showcases food but goes behind the history of it all. It's a lesson in history and culture.

Simply brilliant!"
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Eye candy for art and culture lovers,Just very much the wayfood culture should be presented. I wish they come up with more episodes
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",A very good place to start to understand Indian Cuisine. Just to get a reference of what lies beneath.,"Very well filmed, researched and presented. This series attempts the impossible and does it very well to an extent. Seems like the idea was to give an overall picture of how diverse,complicated, brilliant and old Indian food is and yet trying to start to scratch the surface somewhere. It also feels like a documentary made for Indians in order to remind us about our own food heritage and make us feel very proud about it. I am sure every Indian who watched it felt they missed some obvious recipes but that is justified as around 20 to 30 mins to cover a state's cuisine is an impossible task. Although the presentation is mostly in hindi and as such completely misses the mark in the pronunciation of many south indian dishes (But, its alright, we will let this one slide :P). Immense respect to the boss man ""Pushpesh Pant"", never knew there was a food historian in India. The task at hand is extremely difficult and hence rated 9 on 10 because the effort is commendable and beautiful. Would love to see an episode for a particular district's food within each state but that will become a year long series :P A very good place to start to understand Indian Cuisine. Just to get a reference of what is all the ""fuss"" about.. This series is like the tip of the iceberg. A lot more lies beneath."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Stop dubbing in the new series,"Super program which makes good viewing with good info about our culture in India.

But from the time this program has started dubbing / voice over by manvender.. it has lost its charm . Miss Dr pushpesh authenticity. .his super voice manipulation. Not that manvender is bad or anything but it really needs the original old world charm of the actual character s in the episode."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Lack of involvement in Narrative,"The narration by Manwendra Tripathy has no involvement in the content, making it sound like there is someone who is unconfident and lacks experiential knowledge. This is usually repelling to a listener. I found this especially true of the segment surrounding Tamil Nadu. Coming from there, I also found the visuals and the narratives slightly derogatory. Perhaps the next attempt needs to be narrated by people who come from the region where the food is being prepared from with the visuals being treated with a happier lighting?"
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",A well documented and mouth watering food series,"Stumbled upon this, and I must say that it is well documented. Just how much history can be found in just the food of any state, I was amazed. Was surprised to know some food facts coming from my own state, which I wasn't aware of. Job well done, guys"
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Informative and Engaging,I guess I have seen this show multiple times and every single times it feels like new. Very informative and nicely curative. A must watch show.
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Finally an authentic Indian cuisine documentary!,People need to STOP giving negative reviews to this docuseries. We are already late in showing the world our cuisine and all the health benefits it provides. Foreigners have already realised how valuable and healthy our cuisine is. They have already come here and taken all the recipes to go back to their country and showcase it as their own. So please support this series and stop throwing negative reviews for such silly reasons like dubbing and lighting and all such nonsense. Who cares about all that. See the bigger picture of what this documentary is trying to convey and understand how important it is for our country's history of Indian cuisine to be shown internationally.
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",This is how you present Culture!...Food culture,"Watched this series twice. Extraordinary narration, direction and story telling. So nice to see a quality series, showcase the rich culture variations all across India. Backed with historical significance the series show how food culture is impacted by people and customs. Hope to see more series if produced."
"Raja, Rasoi Aur Anya Kahaniyaan",Boring and superficial,"The content is rather superficial. It makes a poor attempt to explore the origins is culinary culture in various parts of India but fails to go into any depth and remains superficial.

There is so much to explore in India and trying to cram so much in such a few episodes is a mistake. It works have been better to cover less and in more depth."

WHAT / IF,S1=Amazing S2=Meh,Comentario no disponible
WHAT / IF,I liked the first season better,"I enjoyed the first season more than the second. The first season had a propulsive narrative force anchored by the Ultron-Watcher storyline that made for a satisfying finale. The second season didn't have that same overarching plot, as the episodes seemed a lot more cut off from each other. I did enjoy certain episodes, especially the first one with Nebula joining the Nova Corps as I felt it gave off a very steam punk sci-fi vibe that I dug. I also liked the episode involving Hela and the 10 rings. I felt it did a good job basically mimicking the plot of the first Thor movie, but with Hela as the main protagonist. I did appreciate a lot of the action in the second season, but the pacing in both seasons is just so fast paced. This is understandable, as they are attempting to pack in an entire story within 30 minutes of run time. That being said, it's so fast paced that the show doesn't give you pause to breathe and take in the different story beats... especially the dramatic ones. Overall, I felt that the second season was more boring than I would've hoped. The first season was an 8, but I'm going to downgrade the show as a whole to a 7 after completing the second."
WHAT / IF,Cool series with interesting twists n tales.,"This is fun. I am enjoying every story.

Not all episodes are as good but overall it's worth it.

(The doctor strange episode for example was exceptional).

If you are a Marvel fan, you will probably like it, for these -and many more- following reasons:

1-Happy to hear all the voices from the MCU actors. Makes the starting titles interesting; you d wanna see who's in it.

2-The stories are captivating. There's some comedy, action, drama; a good range.

3-There's some great one-liners. New ones and also memorable ones.

4-The pace of each of the episodes is excellent. It really gets you into the story.

5-It does great tribute to MCU's pivotal points.

Give it a go, you will enjoy it.

8/10."
WHAT / IF,Doctor Strange Episode...Wow,Really enjoying this series & the risks they've taken so far.
WHAT / IF,If Carter... ?,"It all started from first season when they really made us realized what if... ? In every vast imaginable possibilities for marvel comics. Mainly, it was a great effort through animations to make us understand the interconnections of every marvel movies and shows totally independent of each other and they did succeed by connecting X-Men, SpiderMan, Elektra, Blade, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, etc. Under one Brand and Studio.

But, they ultimately made this particular show's story totally oriented towards ""The Captain Who Never Was"" i.e. Peggy Carter, making it all about her along with extra irrelevant short What Ifs stories of other characters totally made for Fill Ups."
WHAT / IF,"Great scenarios, but varies between episode","Now that the first season is over, I can confidently say that this series has exceeded my expectations. It uses witty scripts and detailed animation to bring the fans the service they've been wanting and more. Each episode is quite varied so there are many different scenarios and you never know how it will turn out or which characters will show up. The series wastes no time explaining any of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and just gets to the point of the scenarios, and also starts to merge the scenarios without warning. This is for the fans, not casual viewers! However, the variety of episodes also means that the quality and tone also vary quite drastically. The short runtime means that many events and battles are cut short. There was a good amount of care to make everything canon and consistent, but there are still some shortcomings and the power/ability of each character seemed to be contrived based on the needs of the plot."
WHAT / IF,"A lot of wasted potential. A couple of good episodes, though.","When Disney and Marvel announced their Phase 4 slate of releases, What If...? Was something I was certainly looking forward to. After experiencing Phase 4, my expectations were lowered a great deal but I was still interested in checking it out and seeing what kind of else-world stories we might be getting. After watching the entire season, the ensuing disappointment reared its ugly head yet again.

Most of the episodes had What If scenarios superficially executed, filled to the brim with one-liners and jokes that seldom had an impact made worse by the fact that the pacing and runtime hardly gave whatever plot points they were trying to push room to breathe. A rollercoaster ride of either it's just fine or meh. The lack of creativity was also disappointing but not surprising.

To make matters worse, the voice acting was sub-par for the majority of the season with performances feeling as if they were lazily phoned in by the Actors who played the characters in a much better way in their respective Live-Action outings. The soundtrack was mostly generic for the majority of it even though they have a plethora of good tracks from the past to choose from which they hardly did.

The animation was nice, though, even if I wish they would have gone full 2-D with it. At first, I didn't like it but got used to it and was glad that the 3-D stuff wasn't wonky or janky but rather smooth and fluid with some episodes showcasing beautiful stuff and thrilling fight scenes. The faces of some characters, however, could have used a lot more work.

A couple of episodes did stand out, though, and made the entire experience not feel worthless which, ironically, ultimately made it frustrating that why waste all those other episodes mucking around and playing them for laughs and giggles when stuff like this is far more impactful. The Doctor Strange one is my favourite, which surprise surprise works best since it's focused and The Ultron one which gave everyone who was disappointed by Age of Ultron's depiction of that character something to enjoy, even if I wish it was focused more on Ultron and less on other characters.

It all culminates in a mixed bag of a finale which had some truly shoddy writing to justify what happens even though the concept itself was pretty cool. In better hands, I could see this working wonderfully and that's pretty much the running theme of Phase 4 so far. In better hands, there is so much potential but seeing it all go to waste because of poor decision making when it comes to hiring writers and directors... it's just sad and frustrating to see a franchise I loved screw itself up like this.

All in all, it's not the worst thing Phase 4 has put out. Most of the episodes, despite me railing on them above, still had some nuggets of entertainment in them which hey, if you just wanna have just some light forgettable fun, they'll most likely work. A couple of good episodes do make it worth it to check it out at least if you are or was a fan of MCU. Also makes me excited for Multiverse of Madness... please be good *fingers crossed*. It just sucks to see the wasted potential. And if I were to rate Season 1 of What If...?, I'd give it a 6/10."
WHAT / IF,What If.....Marvel didn't sell out to Disney?,"I signed up to Disney due to the Marvel movies and the hype around the streaming shows.....I've been through Wanda which was okay, FatWS which was like being told off in detention, not fun and Loki which was a real disservice to the character.

So onto What If?.... And whilst the idea is interesting and the animation very good (what you'd expect from Disney) I cannot make it through any of these short episodes without falling asleep, drifting off or just turning off. I'm not sure why but there's something not quite right about it that I can't put my finger on, it doesn't hold interest or attention.

Disney subscription has been cancelled, it all has got a bit boring."
WHAT / IF,People need to review the entire show instead of only 1 episode,"IMDB really needs to work on their audience review system. All the bad reviews are only for 1 episode and not the entire series. You can't judge an entire show on its first epiosde.

While Ep 1 wasn't great, the rest are a huge improvement. Intriguing stories and, surprisingly, the humor lands more than you'd think. Decent voice acting and it really helps that most of characters are voiced by their live-action actors.

Overall, don't trust 90% of the bad reviews because they are only rating the first or second episode. Instead, trust the reviews judging the entire series.

The series as a whole isn't terrible. I was hoping for better but ultimately I'm okay with what we got. The epsidoes range from really good to pretty bad but they're enjoyable regardless."
WHAT / IF,Too much Captain Carter!,"There are so many stories here to tell yet there is too much focus on Captain Carter, sure 1 story about her is fine but there's (so far) 3 episodes about her in season 2 and I fear more to come. I'm just not that interested in her. Also skipped the one about the native American hero back in the day...didn't know who she was and didn't care.

They made some odd choices on which stories to tell. I would of liked to see some more spider man, iron Man, hulk and Thor but we got stuck with carter too much or hero's we don't care about.

Required characters are stupid with reviews, its not a God damn thesis."
WHAT / IF,What If...I Love It And Need More?,Comentario no disponible
WHAT / IF,What if...it actually explored REAL possibilities,"As much as I love the animation style and using the original actors for voice-overs, much of 'What If' fizzles and falls short. Many of the storylines have never really dwelt on what many Marvel and comic book fans would think of when asked 'What if?"" To me, this series would be super successful if it actually gave an alternate perspective to known story lines. Episodes like: if Carter became the First Avenger, or Ultron Won, and even 1602 were great. Others just were weirdly, acid-trip induced crap.

As a longtime Marvel fan I never wondered if T'Challa became Star Lord, Nebulla joining the Nova Corps, or in the latest Season 3- Avengers made their own Voltron?!?!

What if the series took the original movies and did the opposite? What if Tony died or New York wasn't saved in Avengers? What if Killmonger succeeded in defeating T'Challa? What if the Guardians couldn't stop Ronan in a dance off?

These are possibilities that would have been fun to explore. Honestly Season 2 should've been the last one, because as evident in Season 3 Episode 1, there's not much imagination left. It's Voltron or Pacific Rim meets the Avengers. Dull and already been done."
WHAT / IF,What if.... The show was good after the first season?,"Talk about potential wasted. In a world where literally anything is available for them to do... They ran out of cool stories after the first season. The first season had fun, exciting, interesting stories - with our favourite marvel characters doing awesome things. Then the second season came along and they chose to focus on lame characters, and ""what if's"" that were no longer meaningful or interesting to watch. For a 30 min show things felt slow for much of each episode. Many of the episodes felt skippable and I had to resist zoning out. Where's more of the ""zombie"" level of What Ifs? That was crazy and wild. That's the kind of What If scenarios I wanted to see."
WHAT / IF,"Good animation, poor pacing, quite disappointing really.",Comentario no disponible
WHAT / IF,Be patient!,Can't believe people would rate so low based on one episode. I've seen four of them so far & it's just getting better and better. Be patient!
WHAT / IF,Not that bad,"I just watched the 3rd episode and came here to write my review, and I'm shocked to see all these negative reviews! It's not the best MCU project but I found some of the storylines interesting. Yes it could be much better for sure, but it's not as bad as written in the reviews. Some folks are mad at Peggy becoming Captain Carter which I find weird, it's happening in an alternate universe, you guys! The series is called What If!

The animation and voice acting could be much better.

Apparantly this series is going to have impacts on the future MCU projects as well, So, give it a chance!

Edit: Some episodes are really good, the Dr Strange episode was mind-blowing. Thor's episode was a blast."
WHAT / IF,"Marvel, please take your cue from the original series!","I really, really, really want to like this series! In fact, I want to love it! I love concepts that explore alternate realities and the like.

In the original ""what if...?"" Series that Marvel published back in the day, you would see things like:

""what if Spiderman had joined the fantastic four?""
"" what is the avengers defeated everybody?""
""what if The alien costume had possessed Spiderman?""
""what if the Hulk had Bruce Banner's brain?""


And on and on it goes. The thing is that these stories were great because they tied directly back to Marvel's original continuity and sometimes ended better, but usually ended more tragically with a twinge of irony.

The only episode I've seen in the series that reflects that vibe so far is the Dr. Strange one. I think it resonates better than all the rest simply because it's based on a choice that we can believe would happen in Stange's continuity. And of course, the results are mind-blowing.

I don't get that same feeling from ""T'challa becomes Starlord,"" because...well, because...or the entire MCU are zombies for no explicable reason. Or that Peggy could've saved Steve best by putting him in a machine that would accelerate his healing. Duh... the Avengers not forming episode was oh-Kay.

What could have made this a powerful series would've been if it had explored real events and choices in the MCU like:

Or
Or
Or ""What if T'Challa still kept Wakanda hidden from the world after BP?"" Or


See? Way more related to what we know and waaaay more interesting.

Oh well, maybe a writer at the Big D will read this and one of these could end up in season 2?"
WHAT / IF,It's promising,I don't think every story is going to be FANTASTIC but I thought these concepts were pretty great and the animation is straight up beautiful. Y'all some haters.
WHAT / IF,Season 1 had some merit; Season 2 is much worse,"As per my title: Season 1 had some merit; Season 2 is much worse. Six stars as a nod to Season 1, which did a good job of tying together (eventually) a coherent and interesting overall story line. The Doctor Strange episodes in particular were really well done.

Season 2 however is much worse - poor writing, much less interesting story lines, and as has been noted by others, a puzzling over abundance of Captain Carter. Is this really what fans were clamouring for? At some point in the MCU series and films, someone needs to realize that pounding home the message 'women rule!' is not the same as actually having good writing and an intelligent plot. There have been notable exceptions: WandaVision, Loki are among strong offerings, but the majority, including Season 2 of What If, has been pretty weak."
WHAT / IF,"Keep watching, it really takes of from episode 3","The first one is ok, but then it goes wilder and wilder. Episode 4 is probably one of the best thing MCU has ever created. So keep watching, it get really good!"
WHAT / IF,Uninteresting finale and overuse of Peggy Carter,Comentario no disponible
WHAT / IF,Really enjoyed it,Really good show great animation shame Chris himself didn't do his voice but was really close sound alike I thought I look forward to next episode don't listen to to haters just enjoy it 👍
WHAT / IF,"Rated the first one with 6stars, increasing 1 star after each episode","A very straight forward episode of rushing things to set those pieces right into the puzzle. And my facial expressions were also pretty straight watching this episode as there was no thrill or even a logical storytelling, I understand it's an aminated show targetted at children maybe? But only those children who are familiar with all the MCU till now might perhaps be able to enjoy it.

Let's see how the rest of the episodes turn out but I am certainly not very excited about them after this one.

Edit : 2nd episode gave the actual feel of what MCU is about, it was creative and thoughtful with major WHAT IF moments. I thoroughly enjoyed watching T'challa back on screen.

However the 3rd episode was deal breaker and made me edit this review. It was so thrilling and exciting to watch, I could have watched a whole movie on this episode. It re explored the characters we know to a level that leaves u wanting for more.

I hope I get to a 10 star edit by the end of the season.

Edit II : Here goes my one more star for a 'strange' yet thought provoking episode which was by far the best among all in terms of writing, voice over, animation and storyline. Special mention for Benedict Cumberbatch for nailing the voice over like a boss. Take a bow Marvel for making this one.

However, coming to 5th episode, the episode was entertaining for sure, it was humorous and engaging with quality animation but again showed too much simultaneously not giving viewers enough time to absorb things.

Still a 9/10 overall for the series until next two episodes atleast. They gotta beat the episode 4 to get a 10 from me."
WHAT / IF,Who wrote S3?,"I just watched the first 4 episodes of S3 and they are pathetic. Its like a 10 year old wrote them, so childish and shallow. I'm not even going to bother watching the rest. The mcu wasn't for me for a while now, but this show doens't help pull me back in at all. I really liked Deadpool and Wolverine, they understand how to do proper comedy, but this is just so lazy. Why does everything in the mcu has to he a comedy? Just do something serious once in a while. Marvel lost me again. Lets hope DC has more mature stories, but with James Gunn I doubt it. Guess I'm done with comic book movies then, it was a fun ride uptill Endgame."
Surviving Summer,Refreshingly good vibes from atypical teen surfer show,"While no masterpiece, this bit of surf, gorgeous Aussie locations and romantic teen adventures has its moments. There's a feel-good atmosphere behind each episode that is almost more Kiwi than Aussie. Smiles abound and tensions are soon resolved, the condescending moral storytelling so often associated with Hollywood teen efforts nowhere in sight."
Surviving Summer,So fun!,Clean good fun. Super refreshing teen show! I'm not a teen but it was fun to watch! Plus the soundtrack was great! Hopefully they some out with season two!
Surviving Summer,Great Summer Break Viewing,This brought back some old school good summer vibes when people went to the beach and surfed out their issues. There was an air of innocents to this while still remaining relevant. I highly recommend for some lighthearted entertainment.
Surviving Summer,Feel-good show!,"My husband and I started this show (and finished it) last night, and it was a very cute, feel-good show. I wasn't sure what to expect, as most films I've seen about Australia lately revolve around an American moving there and falling in love with it, so I figured it'd be typical. Yes, it's not a storyline you've never heard before, but the show was well-made and each episode, though only a half hour, felt like a little mini-movie. I hope it gets renewed for a second season, as I'd love to see Summer return to Australia! (Or maybe...Ari visit New York?? It does have a beach...)"
Surviving Summer,Another American exiled to paradise,"By the fourth episode most main characters, in this case ""Summer"" begin to be somewhat likable. Not the case with this lead. She's everything the ""ugly American"" represents while overseas, in this series, Australia. She's annoying, entitled and a snob. I'm not sure the writers intended it to be this way or if it's the delivery by the lead actress, Sky Katz. Either way she's from New York City and portrays New York teens as those who believe there's no place else in the world except NYC and she's got a smart ass answer for every other character, especially adults.

She gets sent off by her mother to Australia to live with her aunt, uncle and their two kids, because of her bad behavior. The boy, Ari, has had a surfing accident that put him out of surfing for a year. There is the usual teenage drama with a really obnoxious teenage American mixed in. If you can handle the lead actress's character it's worth watching."

No. But it had good story lines, interesting characters who had some emotional depth and grew throughout the series. It was funny and quirky, and very friendship focused. It had romance, but it also really showed complex platonic relationships, and family ones.

After waiting months for season two we were so excited, only to find a lot of the charm and depth removed in favour of (very) lingering shots on bikini-clad bodies, and very cliched love triangle / mean-girl storylines. Almost all emotional insight has been removed from more grown-up subjects leaving a much crasser result. Not merely less suitable for a tween, but rather boring for me as an adult too (this is no heartbreak high or s*x education in its handling). My daughter decided for herself not to continue and I probably won't bother either, a real shame as I really will miss the anchor cove originals and Summer."

Abducted in Plain Sight,What the hell did I just watch?!?!,"By the time I reached the 30 minute mark, if the topic had not been so serious, I would have sworn that I was watching a hoax film. These parents have got to be the most gullible, stupid, ignorant people on the planet. I'm shocked any of their children were lucky enough to make it to adulthood. The serial perpetrator is a piece of garbage who got ""lucky"" enough to stumble upon the perfect mark. My heart bleeds for the victim. She was let down by every adult in her life. It's a fascinating watch, if only for the unbelievably naive mother and father. I don't know whether to give the parents credit for embarrassing themselves by telling their story or not. I'm still sitting here with my jaw hanging open."
Abducted in Plain Sight,Fascinating and Disturbing,"As a documentary this held my interest from start to finish. I'm a little surprised that folks would rate it low due to the disturbing content which I found to be honestly and painfully presented in first person by family members. I think it's absolutely credible to present the unbelievable effort that some of these predators make on a long term planning level to entrap their prey. I would have liked to see inclusion of the predator's wife and family but I suspect they are too ashamed even now to come out publicly. In my opinion, Berchtold's wife should have been prosecuted as an accessory to have colluded to keep her husband out of jail and to have turned a blind eye to his activity. I'm glad to have viewed this. I only ran into one person while my daughter was growing up who seemed far too interested in spending his time with pre-adolescent girls. I watched this person like a hawk until my daughter was too old to be of any interest. She also had a gut sense to avoid interaction but not all children are born with that. So I say buckle up, be incredulous about what happened but watch. Don't rate this low because it exposes stupidity. Kudos to Jan's family for sharing what some might take to the grave."

Sneakerheads,"Really good watch, if your into sneakers","I have a big addiction to sneakers so when i heard about this show it was an instant watch, after watching it all.

Sneakerheads,What I've excepted,"Medium-bad players and ridiculous plot, but still entertaining for those who truly considers themselves as OG sneaker heads."
Sneakerheads,I laughed throughout this tv show,Sneakerheads is Hilarious and brilliant! I thought this was the best comedy I've seen in a long while. It really made me laugh out loud .Sneakerheads is a great combination of comedy and drama and also a little bit of more fun. Netflix wins on this one you must watch this show.
Sneakerheads,Just for fun,Can't expect more from a bunch of freaks searching a pair of sneakers. Guess Nike and Jordan will have paid a good amount for this publicity.
Sneakerheads,"I'm not a sneakerhead, so I found this to be all-right","Sneakerheads is a Netflix comedy series, that follows a squad of sneaker enthusiasts through a series of hijinks, and a quest to find a rumored legendary sneaker. I don't know much about the sneaker art form, and I was hoping this show would give me some insight, but unfortunately, that's not the case. With a cast of up-and-comers, the series might be aiming for a younger crowd, which would explain why I couldn't really put myself into it.

It manages to drag out a story, while also being quite contained. The dialogue and character development is very weak, and requires suspension of disbelief. At multiple times, this quite clearly came off as a scripted TV show , with very little attempt made to build believable plot lines. The two leads, Devin (Allen Maldonado) and Bobby (Andrew Bachelor) are portrayed as ex best friends, but there wasn't too much chemistry there. I don't really understand why they would continue to hang out together, which is also a result of poor plot design. Bobby's schemes in the episodes are so out of the box, and completely plot heavy, that I'm surprised Devin goes along with it. We also have Nori and Stuey, the rest of the squad, as comic relief, and they do make the show a lot more fun. There's a very clear ""We're the Millers"" vibe, which usually works in their favors. The series also has a few fun celebrity cameos, whom I assume, are real-life sneaker heads.

All things considered, this is an all-right show. My opinion is probably supported by the fact that I don't know this culture; Someone who is a genuine sneaker-head, or a fan of King Back, may be thoroughly entertained. I can give it a pass because its run-time isn't exhausting (6 episodes, 20 minutes), so you don't lose too much time. For a vast majority, this works better as background content, while doing chores. 6.5/10"
Sneakerheads,"Great feel good show, with some cool cameos & funny moments.","This show was purely fun to watch, its almost like a coming of age story where the main character goes back to revisit his past by revising visiting his collector lifestyle and the show makes it feel ok to enjoy things that others might think is childish. The show reminds us, growing up doesn't mean you have to give up your hobbies. There was just something relatable and nice about the overall story ark and it leaves you feeling good by the end and happy for the main characters adventure.

Definitely enjoyable and worth a watch, especially if you enjoy shows like ""How to make it in America"" Wish there was another season but it closes up well so you don't need one."

The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Knock Knock...F%@k Off.,"While I respect the opinions of those who criticized the show (not surprisingly the comments rated ""least useful""), it appears that their views are so concrete that they just don't get it.

This brilliant series is not intended to reflect the ""reality"" of trailer park life in Nova Scotia, but is instead a wonderful artistic compilation of many extreme, bizarre, and mundane experiences that are interesting on an entertaining and (feigned) voyeuristic basis. There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now ""park operas"".

Consider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act ""in character"" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.

Let's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.

How is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country.

If given a chance, you will see how the brilliance shines through the layers of carefully placed sh#@. It is meant to look amateurish!"
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Julian's drink,Makes me laugh out loud every episode. Every day I think about the episode he climbs out of the car flip with a full drink
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,There is a special sort of charm about this show. Know what I'm sayin'?,"I've been an avid fan of the show for about a decade now. There's an odd charm, a bit of an attraction to the simplicity of the way of life that the characters in the show live, that is oddly alluring. Talk about a fictional, worry-free escape in the world of television, this is the epitome of such a deviation from the real world.

The show follows three main characters: Ricky, who is the completely emotionally-fueled, irrational one of the lot, who constantly puts himself AND OTHERS into horrible and illegal situations, only to shrug it off as ""no big deal"" (one of the show's many running jokes), and tries to pass the blame onto someone else. And then there's Julian, who is often seen as the ""brains"" of the trailer park, but really he's mostly in it for himself, and while his heart in usually in the right place, and it's known he cares about his friends, he often forgets the latter and makes decisions only to benefit himself. He also is never seen without a rum & coke in his hand. And finally, there's Bubbles. A special lad, with an adorable affection for kitties, he's usually the voice of reason between the three, even though he may come off as more ""special"" than his friends. He's the more sympathetic of the trio, and an avid Rush fan. Sometimes, due to the crazy antics of his friends and the lovable psychos of the trailer park, he's often put into unfortunate situations.

And one HAS to give love to the man who plays Jim Lahey, who is the drunk and vengeful supervisor of the trailer park, always looking to get even with ""the boys."" And a special nod goes to J-Roc, one of TV's most hilariously pathetic characters, whose quotes will live on forever,""'naw what I'm sayyin' booiii?"" Seriously, every scene with this character is absolute gold.

The show is absolutely hilarious. The characters are so ridiculous, their ways of life and their mannerisms are so preposterous you can't help but love them. If you can get past all the crude language, that is. And of that, there is a LOT. But the whole show is riddled with brilliant comedy, memorable quotes, and a charming flow.

I absolutely LOVE this show. Especially the first half dozen seasons, before they were picked up by Netflix. I hate repeating myself, but there is such an uncanny CHARM to this show, it's completely irresistible."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,"understated brilliance, continuing the great Canadian comedy tradition","Like most people when I first saw this show I thought it was just another mindless low budget comedy series aimed at the dim-witted pot smokers among us. Then I watched it more and became mesmerized by the underlying brilliance, everything was not as it seemed, from the beautifully languid intro music, to the ingenious documentary style of filming. Much like SCTV, it uses the low budget quality of the show, and turns that into a bonus. THe shaky hand-held camera, the occasional boom mic shot all blend perfectly with the mostly improvised dialogue. There's something uniquely Canadian about this, making the best out of the fewest resources, and it demonstrates the greatness of the show that it does not need huge production values to make you laugh your ass off. And laugh you will as you watch the main characters, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles stumble their way through life. We have all met people like this, much like in the movie ""Fubar"", people who are completely ignorant and emotionally underdeveloped, yet very much content with their position in life. Both Fubar and TPB, the key is not to make fun of these people in a condescending way, look equally at their naive stupidity but also at their loyalty and innocence and genuineness.

The 80's had SCTV, the 90's Kids in the Hall, for Canada, the 00's belong to the Trailer Park boys."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,NO MATTER HOW BAD LIFE IS THIS SHOW FIXS IT!!!,"I advise every human being on earth to watch this show, idc how bad your day has been or what's going on in your life this show will brighten your day and I promise you that you will Laugh and Smile while your watching the Amazing cast, John Dunsworth(Mr.Lahay) is hands down one of my personal favorite actors but this man is a Genius and plays a Drunk person Amazingly and he will be missed o so very much! Bottom Line this show will brighten your day I PROMISE!!!!"
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,"Incredible, brilliant show","Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!! I am trying to spread the word down here in California."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,A Riot,This show is THE funniest damn show ever produced in Canada. What a bunch of dumbasses these characters are! You must see this show. It is the funniest thing. Just a bunch of small town folks living in a trailer park trying to make it. Truly amazing!
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Great show through the first 7 seasons.,Great comedy from Canada. The cast of characters is great and hilarious. Lots of funny moments and seasons. The show was funny but kind of tanked once Netflix brought it back. The movies are pretty good too.
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,A gem that needs to be more recognised,"This is my first review on this site.

This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen.

At first, I was a bit put off from it due to the way they film it. But once I grew on it by watching more episodes, it's actually a brilliant masterpiece.

The characters are very interesting, in a ludicrous way. It's amazing how they continuously make such addictive story lines for such a small environment to work on.

This is very cheaply made but with that in play, a lot of creativity put into such little to play with. That's what mostly makes it brilliant."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,The noblest form of comedy i've ever enjoyed.,"At first, it seems like the trailer park boys is a typical cult comedy you should watch if you want to watch something while high, but as the show keeps going you realize that this show is a masterpiece of classical comedy. Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.

The show is full of many other interesting characters that have their own brand attitude that makes this show so funny and well made. The exaggeration is the main protagonist here, abuse, swearing, dope, gunfights all in a perfect mix of comedy exaggeration. The show wins you by making you love the characters and their exaggerating attitude the outlaw lifestyle and their constants attempts to make a living.

If you love honest comedy, you are going to f-kin love this show. Thumbs up for Canada."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Acquired-Taste Mockumentary is Nearly Perfect,"When most people sit down with Trailer Park Boys Season One, they are going to be confused. It's crude, amoral, and not traditionally funny. It's also a direct continuation of a lesser known movie, which is an even bigger entry barrier to enjoying what turns out to be one of the best comedy series ever made.

Comedy is arguably the most subjective genre in film, and it would not surprise me if many people can't hurdle the walls that this show puts in place.

I have trouble recommending it to a general audience.

However, the brilliance of TPB isn't overt. It's in the subtext, verisimilitude, heart, and attention to detail. Similar to Idiocracy, the dumb-slapstick humor often provides a thick veil that the viewer must push aside to reveal the real comedic backbone of the content.

Most of the funniest stuff in this show isn't said, but rather shown or implied.

The sets and the props, for instance, are incredibly detailed and destitute. There are bits of hilarity strewn through the backdrops of almost every scene that a discerning viewer will notice and get a chuckle from. TPB, particularly in seasons 1-7, is relentless in portraying poverty, criminality, and desperation. This perspective is never broken in the early seasons, and its painfully accurate in many of its non-judgmental representations of people in the lowest rungs of society who are just trying to get-by.

The cast of eclectic characters equally shines here. Everyone in the park has a very distinct personality and reason for existing within the park's ecosystem. Even in the later seasons, when they ramp the silliness up while leaning into caricatures, it's still a joy to watch. There's a certain comfort that the viewer gets with this cast, as if we are also living in the park with them.

And, that's probably the show's greatest success - being a window into the lives of flawed people living in a tough situation, but who are still trying to make the best out of it. There's simply no other show quite like it.

When Netflix (known in the show as SwearNet) took over the show for seasons 8-12, it was eight years after the original series finale aired. Someone, perhaps Mike Smith (Bubbles) who became a primary writer, decided to change some of the portrayals in the show to be extremely over-the-top. Many fans of the original series despise these changes, and refuse to even watch the last five seasons.

However, once one gets used to the cartoony switch of tone, there is plenty of amusement and laugh-out-loud moments to still be had. Though it does feel like Netflix ripped some of the tone and heart from Clattenburg's classic, the show still ends up feeling a cut above other comedies, mostly due to the great character-acting and ridiculous plotlines.

Even though I gave TPB a perfect 10 rating, the show isn't perfect by any means. In my countless viewings, I've noticed some continuity errors and jarring pacing. The five Netflix seasons, specifically, are tonally disconnected from the original series in many ways.

However, the re-watchability of TPB is unlike any show I've ever seen. Many, many shows were influenced by this early mockumentary, and it's obvious why. This is a great binge and an even greater background-show. It's consistently funny and realistic, while still being silly and bombastic.

Nothing is perfect, but for what this show is, nothing could be perfecter.

10/10 Must-Watch."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Funniest show on TV,"My favourite thing about trailer park boys has to be the characters, they are CRAZY, from ricky trying to get his 4th grade to Lahey trying to get the boys thrown in jail.

There is nothing else like it on TV .

Its so surreal and absurd at some points you cant help but wet yourself with laughter. every season is as good as the last including season 6, even though most people say it sucks, COME ON PEOPLE, THE FILM IS OUT IN THE SUMMER! I just hope they keep making this show whether the movie is a success or not.

LONG LIVE TRAILER PARK BOYS!"
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Original seasons good/Netflix seasons not so good,"As my title says, the original 7 seasons that aired on Showcase in Canada from 2001 to 2007 were great. Yes, I even loved season 7, which it seems most other fans of the show don't really like this season, but I do and honestly, compared to the Netflix seasons, you'll appreciate season 7 a lot more. Also, the original TPB The Movie released in 2006 and was pretty good. The show seemed to have ended with season 7 in '07, but of course, fans wanted more of the boys and due to popular demand, a TV movie was released titled Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, which was pretty great in my opinion. Then another movie titled Countdown to Liquor Day was released the following year in 2009, which was, just Ok, in my opinion, of course. Finally, a 4th movie was released titled Don't Legalize It, which got mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it. Along with this came the announcement that Netflix was bringing the series back and that same year in September of 2014, Netflix released season 8 of Trailer Park Boys. And..., well, honestly, I didn't hate this season. I actually kind of liked it. Though, Mike Clattenburg's (the creator, head writer, and director of pretty much the entire show/movies up until this) absence from the show was very apparent. It was waaaay more over-the-top than it had ever been before, which was definitely a bad thing...ya know....in my opinion. But it wasn't terrible. However, we then come to season 9 released on Netflix on March 27th 2015 and...dear god, season 9 was just...it was so bad. It was so, so bad. I hated it so much. I found myself cringing so often and maybe let out a slight chuckle here and there. I know as shows go on, characters always tend to become caricatures of themselves, but this was ridiculous. In prior seasons, Ricky was at least capable of speaking at a normal volume sometimes. In this season, he pretty much screams every single word he says. The whole season is just bad. And season 10 is even worse. Not much to say other than it's just god-awful. It feels like it's trying so so hard to be over-the-top and give shock-humor but it's just bad in every way. Seasons 11 and 12 were definitely a huge step up from the previous 2 before it but still nothing great. Seasons 1-7 were peak TPB for me and I'm sure most fans of the show would probably agree."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,I just don't get it.,"Season One: 3/10

Themes: Trailer Park, Comedy, Ex-Cons, Drugs, Petty Crime, Friendship, Stupidity & Canadian.

Review: I really do not understand the appeal of this show. It's about a bunch of complete idiots, doing nothing but scream at each other, swear like there's no tomorrow, fire off guns as if it's their new favourite toy, and be drunk all the damn time. It just wasn't funny and I didn't laugh even once. The characters were extremely annoying to the point of me rolling my eyes at them every episode. The plot itself is also super uninteresting; it's the same thing over and over again, and besides being repetitive, it was very boring in and of itself. I'm definitely not a fan. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I just don't see what would be entertaining about this series. It was just silly and ridiculous."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,It grows on you,"When I first left a review of this show I was fairly unimpressed with it. However, since then I've forced myself to watched the entire Seasons 1-3 and I have to say it: man, was I wrong.

It grows on you. If you can get over the bad acting and the political incorrectness you'll find one hell of a show. As another reviewer said it's not an accurate reflection of life in a Nova Scotia trailer park: more like if you took the weirdest members of every trailer park in NS and put them together to dumb it up.

Some of the funnier aspects I've found have been Ricky's constant mispronunciations (there are at least then in every episode), Mr Lahey's constant sh*t analogies, and, of course, Bubbles, who makes even the bad episodes worth watching.

If you give it a chance you won't have a single favourite episode; more like a collection of favorite moments pulled from each ep. Whether it's J-Roc's identity crisis (""I hate to admit it ... I'm white""), Bubbles' dragging a drunken Ricky home in the back of his go-cart, or the visit from the hysterically creepy Bible Pimp, there'll be at least something that makes you giggle whenever you think of it.

All that said, BBC America can look forward to a few letters of mixed reactions, and Comedy Central can start kicking themselves for not being the first to snatch it up."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Brilliant,"I got the first two seasons on DVD as a gift just recently...I had sadly never heard of the show before that. That being said, I sat down and started watching and I ended up watching the first two seasons right in a row practically without stopping....that's how good it is. A lot of the comedy is subtle, background stuff that continues to surface even after multiple viewings. This show is definitely geared towards people with a slightly twisted sense of humor that don't require a laugh track or a punch line to clue them into the humor. All hilarity aside, this crew does a good job in getting you to believe in the characters and to generally want to know what happens with them -- even when you know most of what they WILL do will make you cringe one way or another. Now I have to see about getting other seasons on DVD..."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,A comedy groundbreaker,Comentario no disponible
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,One of the funniest,"Watched the first episode and wasn't really impressed. My son-in-law talked me into giving the show another try. Some of the best comedy, EVER, from any country. Went to see the stage show with Tremblay,Wells and Smith in Dearborn in 2012. True to form these guys were just hilarious. Smith is also a good singer and accomplished guitarist.

Many ""back"" stories about these characters, ""Bubbles"" actually showed up on the set to apply for a sound mixing job and someone asked him to try on the goofy glasses........a star was born, so to speak.""Ricky's"" dad ""Ray"" is actually one of the executive producers and Sarah in real life is Jim Lahey's daughter."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Trailer PARK BOYS!!,"The definition of Canadian comedy with a strong sense of a reality mockumentary. At first you may laugh at the show's odd characters, semi skilled acting, and the amount of swearing and outrages endings. The main group is Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, all putting their own twist on the trio. Set in a trailer park the group simply solves their financial problems through robberies, cultivation, guns and scams everyone more extreme then the next. The group has there highs and their very lows, living in the shitmobile and constantly fighting the trailer park supervisor. I love this show and cant get enough of it, everyone should give it a try and watch the emotional roller-coaster of The Trailer Park BOys."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,One of the best shows I've seen,"And I watch WAYYY TOO MUCH TV AND MOVIES. This show is one of the funniest shows I've seen so far. The characters are great, I especially love Ricky-obviously. The fact that there is a character who refuses to wear shirts should make you want to watch this on it's own.

I read a comment that said it's isn't like real trailer park life in Nova Scotia, and maybe not. But it's a pretty damn accurate portrayal of life in a U.S. trailer park in the south. I mean, I've seen these people at Wal-Mart...all of them. There's a Jim Lehey everywhere, you just have to look hard enough.

Don't forget to watch The Mighty Boosh!"
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Thumbs WAY up down south,"Now, for a comment from a yank. This is THE funniest, THE biggest-hearted show I've ever had the good fortune to stumble across! On behalf of all of us poor, misbegotten souls that live due south of you Canadian's lower border (a.k.a the tree line) (sorry, I just couldn't resist), thank you, thank you, thank you! TPB isn't distributed in the U.S. as far as I can tell, so if you're a yank and unless you happen to live near the border and can watch CBC you won't know about this show other than by freak accident (it was a Netflix experiment for me). I see from the last couple of pages that there really are a few trifling slobs (on both sides of the Canadian/U.S. DMZ) that just don't get it. Well , I'm truly sorry for those poor miserable souls, probably something to do with the amount of fiber in their diet, but down here in Alabama WE sure get it! I've made it a (minor) mission to spread TPB around to everyone I can find with a pulse and I have yet to find anyone who (after a few episodes) hasn't been won over heart and soul (I make my friends send off for the DVD's after the first I give them, kind of like the neighborhood pusher). I won't say they don't exist in 'Bama (a land that may not have invented trailer parks, but has certainly perfected them) just that they're rare. Maybe that's why I like this part of the planet so much. I'm sorry for those who just don't get it, but I'm hard pressed to understand them either. After all, anyone who has ever had a family should recognize Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, et. al., with all their schemes, their plots, all their massively dysfunctional and f***ed up ways (to quote Ricky), and all their grace and generosity (where it REALLY matters) immediately. I know I certainly do, those guys are everyone I'm related to and everyone I ever grew up with boiled down and condensed. Apparently a lot of others do as well, which says many good things about the human race (even that part of it living in the desert south of you Canadian's border). This is a magnificent show, it makes me laugh so hard I have to pace myself so I won't end up at the doctor's office. I'm waiting on pins and needles for the movie (which should be out this month according to the net) and for the next season, and I really do mean pins and needles, what in the world will Ricky do next?! If you've somehow managed to read this far along in the comments and haven't seen TPB, do yourself a favor and get it! If you still don't like it eat a bran muffin or something, you're obviously in need it."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Great Show... Just Gets Better.,"When I first discovered TPB, I really felt I discovered a new type of cult following. You know that moment when you saw Peep Show or The Thick of It for the first time? It felt like that. Fresh, laugh out loud comedy.

It's also great how the boys manage to get you on their side even though you know most of what they're doing is downright criminal. The sociology of this program is great as it paints a picture of very petty Trailor Park criminals who are also just people trying find their way in the world and establish peace in the park - despite some crazy antics, they really are good people who you root for.

I found it got progressively funny throughout seasons. At first, I turned off S8/E1 because it seemed a little polished and scripted but I went back to it after years and found it really did grip me much more than the previous series - the polishing was absolutely spot on. The stories got deeper and the new characters actually grew on me. What a great show."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Great mockumentary,"Wow. The great thing about this show, is that if someone didn't tell you it was not an actual documentary, you would not know any difference. These guys are unbelievable actors, I cannot picture them in their normal lives. They are Julian, Ricky, Bubbles, Mr. Lahey, etc. Think of less pathetic and sad, but funnier versions of the hosers in FUBAR.

I saw them at an HMV signing, and just could not get used to mike smith (Bubbles) without the glasses, serious under-bite and voice. It may be a little tough to get used to but if you give this show a chance, get to know the characters, you will not regret it. If you live in the States, and have never seen it, and got a little money to blow on a great series, head over to your favourite place to order movies online and order it right away.

Although Seinfeld will always be my favourite comedy series of all time, TPB comes in at a close second. Easily the best movie/show to come out of Canada.

Thank God I live in Canada, and gave this show a chance one night, I now cannot wait for Sunday night to roll along with a new episode.

Also cant wait for the TPB movie!"
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Cult favorite,"This show will be a cult favorite, like another Canadian classic SCTV. One day it will be showing on US cable and watch out this show will explode. Like the hosers on SCTV, this show pokes fun at Canadians in a backwards way. Nice to see people laugh at themselves. What makes this show funny, is some of these characters must result from real life experiences. Everyone either has a relative, friend, co-worker, like Ricky, Bubbles, Corry, Trevor, and J Rock. J Rock the 29 year old, ridiculous looking White rapper wannabe, who lives with his mom. Ricky, the trailer park idiot,(Will Farrel of the show) who provides 90% of the material, while living in a car missing a right door; and Corry with his pal Trevor the 2 slow witted wannnabes who end up holding the bag. Living in East Kildonan this reminds me of my youth and shows how believable casting, and writing overcomes a lower budget. What's next a show about Postal Workers."
The Trailer Park Boys Xmas Special,Why do so many Canadians think this is funny?,"I just don't understand why so many people in Canada actually believe this is so hilarious. I grant you, some times there is a line or two that hit the funny bone and the premise is decent (though much of it is recycled episode after episode), but the vast vast majority of bit intended to be funny just are not. I mean, one time with the ""shit__"" (shitthis, shitthat, shitstorm, shittornado, shitwhatever) is funny because it shows something about the Leahy character, but every frikking episode?! And after the first season or two, everybody seems to concatenate ""shit"" to everything, not just Leahy. It's like they got a laugh out of it once so they repeat it ad nauseum. And the drink constantly in hand, OK, that works for a while and would work better if there were periods where there is no drink, but it is no longer funny and is entirely forced after a few seasons of it. And the Bubbles character...I'm sorry, I love laughing at the disabled as much as any red-blooded able-bodied person, but come on. There is not a line out of his mouth that is funny on its own, everything is un-funny/dumb and is forced through his dull imitation of an idiot savant voice. It's about like watching the character that Jerry Lewis played with Dean Martin updated with ""sh*t"" and ""f*ck"". And they devote whole shows to the one unfunny bit that they seem to think is hilarious. Case in point, ""Conky"".

I believe they conceived the whole program based entirely around the guy who plays Ricky being very adept at malapropisms and having the eastern Canadian redneck schtick down very well. The other characters, every one of them, were afterthoughts, straight men/women for him to play off. In fact, much of the dialogue comes off as ad lib by people who are nervous doing it and are not very clever or quick, as though they were told a situation and had to wing it from there, playing a sort of mad-lib with the other actors. Like the director said, ""Ok, everyone, Conky is a ventriloquists doll that Bubbles really likes. Play with that. And....action!"" Besides the occasional Ricky-based funny bits, I think the best part of the show is the entry and exit music; it is somehow to me soothing, lightly happy and nostalgic, like it deserves to have a bubble machine in the background. I honestly think that is why I have watched so many of the episodes because, honestly, if you've seen one you have seen them all, or at least seen all the jokes."

Jane the Virgin,Cute and nutty,"I wasn't really pulled in by the first episode of this series, which I took to be a comedic soap-opera. But after my girlfriend insisted we watch more, I realized it's more soap parody, and while it does lead pretty heavily on its soap origins, it is so over-the-top and wacky that I've grown to really like it.

Give it a chance."
Jane the Virgin,The Best New Show of 2014,"I came in with trepidation. The whole premise is preposterous. How wrong could I have been? Turns out very.

""Jane the Virgin"" (still not thrilled with the title) is beyond charming. The lead actress is adorable and so believable -- even in this jaded age. The switching between English and Spanish dialog (please don't change this; Americans don't like sub-titles but the gimmick works) -- muy excelente! The very witty writing about cultural mores, traditional and contemporary, is something very missing in today's entertainment. I caught a repeat episode of ""Mike and Molly"" the other night (I've only seen the first episode and did not laugh once) and was reminded of the raw, crude language that completely turned me off; that is not comedy. Yet, it is the norm today, unfortunately.

Go ahead and take the plunge -- give ""Jane the Virgin"" a try. She will steal your heart; she already has mine."
Jane the Virgin,On a steady decline across all the dimensions,"Have just binged watched over the last couple of weeks, from episode 1 to episode 29 and sadly, as fun as the beginning was--it is on a slow and steady decline. It is clearly a telenovela, and amusing as such. A definite departure from credibility, but fun.

However, by episode 29, Jane is simply an annoying as a character--her lack of common sense (despite the narrator's description otherwise), her naiveté, her stubbornness and self-righteousness --all come together to make her very unappealing. I can't imagine why either Michael or Rafael are in love with her even in suspended reality.

On the other hand, one can see why both Michael and Rafael are interesting and desirable mates. They both have more passion and intensity as characters.

The other characters are simply fun.

Overall, the acting is great, but the script writers need to find some way to make the main character, Jane, charming again. Because right now it's a drag to watch her, and the other characters can't carry the show alone."
Jane the Virgin,Refreshing,"Jane the Virgin is a series I never really expected to fall in-love with. I actually started watching it only this year 2019, which is a very hard year for me. So I'm very thankful that I found this fantastic series.

I grew up watching telenovelas (or teleseryes, as we call them here). I love the genre. So when I saw the pilot, I instantly began to like it...the style and the tone of the story. A comedy, a drama, a romance, a mystery crime, almost everything's in it. I love the creativeness of this show, and the narrator and the animations are some of the best aspects of this show that makes it unique. The cast is also fantastic, and I simply fell in-love with the characters. Unlike most telenovelas, the characters here have more depth and are more relatable. After watching the ending, it's really hard to say goodbye to them. The ending is simply perfect.

If you haven't watched this yet, please do. Be prepared to fall in-love. Be prepared for the shocking twists. Be prepared to cry, laugh, and feel different emotions all at once. This series is a gem."
Jane the Virgin,The Best Ever,"I am heartbroken that this amazing series has ended. It was the best Latin/American telanovela ever. The story line that was created the journey is something I will never ever forget. I cried at the last few episodes. The series finale brought tears of happiness, sadness and joy. The cast was phenomenal. The entire Jane The Virgin series was impeccable thank you for an amazing 5 seasons!

Jane the Virgin,The finale was worth it!,"This is one of the best shows on CW and it was everything and more! The finale gave me inspiration to write my review. It was a rollercoaster of tears. One minute you are crying and the next you're laughing your butt out and still can't help it because you're still crying. It screws with your emotions but like in a really cool way. Everyone had their happy ending and yes, we all knew it was a ""telenovela"" but who cares. I'm an emotional wreck right now, writing this review. And I'm so privileged and grateful to have spent the last five years with the Villanueva women..."
Jane the Virgin,Loved it at first but now.....,Comentario no disponible
Jane the Virgin,I loved it but sadly im starting to dislike the main character,"Jane at first was a young likeable woman. But after a while she becomes annoying and unrealistic. I started to like petra better actually when i couldnt stand her at first. Jane character made me rethink her motive. She clearly looks like an opportunist that took advantage of being knocked up by her crush and dismantled pedra dreams of her perfect family. It would be great if she didn't act as if pedra wasnt in rhe way of him being their for her son too, considering she have every right to be bitter about the thing. Overall its still a funny show thats why i gave it 6 stars, the main character just need to a tune up to be more likeable."
Jane the Virgin,Refreshing and phenomenal. A perfect mix of TV culture.,"Coming from a country that airs cheap telenovela, it's refreshing to watch an improved everything of what a telenovela should be.

Jane the Virgin is one of the shows that do not care what the current audience wants to see / is interested to see. The plot is in itself far away from what a typical viewer is interested to watch. The plot is outrageous and in the nature of telenovelas. The creators made the show at high stakes but they also reaped greater rewards.

The cast is perfect. Each cast can carry a scene a telenovela would but with a very ""American TV-show"" feel. The fact the they are all talented, beautiful, and god-help-me-I'm-dying-of-laughter funny can't hurt.

What I hate about telenovelas (Aside from seeing them 5 times a week, yes, 5 times a week ) is the repetitiveness and pacing. That's not a problem with this show. I like how the show foreshadow scenes and repeat scenes with very minor but very impactful changes. The ""American TV-show"" pace is perfect too.

I just can say that if you like watching TV shows but is kind of bored of the mainstream vampires, sci-fi, superheroes, crime, teen girl, drama, kind. You might just be blown away with this gem of a show. This show need more hype."
Jane the Virgin,only 1st and 2nd seasons are good,I'm at the third season and this show just stopped making any sense so badly done and developed
Jane the Virgin,Two words: Yael Grobglas,"Okay so this isn't a high class fancy proffessional review. Story ist fine, it's fun to watch, nice idea and intelligent executed.. BUT if you are not convinced yet - watch for Petra. You may not get it yet... but you will. Yael Grobglas acting and the character is extraotdinary!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE PETRAAAA"
Jane the Virgin,Lead character is intolerable,"I started watching the series hating Petra and Rafael, thinking Jane had a good heart. Turns out Petra and Rafael are the good guys in the series. Jane is selfish, whiny and outrageous! I don't understand why anyone would wanna be with her, leave alone two nice good hearted men. I love Rogelio and his drama and Xo too. Alba has gotten better through the seasons (more forward thinking). But seriously, someone needs to give Jane a smack or two and bring miss perfect back to earth!"
Jane the Virgin,Rogelio Spin-off please,"First 2 seasons..... LOVED! Then writers bring in politics and I'm done. Can't we just have some entertainment without bringing us down with politics? I watch TV to escape from our everyday realities, I want to getaway and not think about the world outside of my picture box.

Anyway, I totally enjoyed Rogelio's character, he so needs a show of his own. #teamrogelio #iloverogelio #rogeliospinoff"
Jane the Virgin,One to watch time and time again!,"I have binge watched the series twice now, and I probably will several more times in the next few years! All of the characters play such amazing parts. I personally love them all, well at least love to hate a few. I would love to see this come back one day as a ""While you were gone"" said by the narrator; to bring at least one more season. I truly believe that not only I would appreciate a come back season(s), that the whole fan base would be overwhelmed with joy."
Jane the Virgin,This show has it all!!,"I truly loved this show - it was my first anything close to a telenoeva show - and please ignore all the negative comments that didn't even finish the show. I LOVE how IMOERFECT all the characters are and how much they grow - 3 steps forward 2 back - over and over again.

I have shared a lot of tears and laughter with this show and I can't wait to watch it all again some day.

I used to want to be a writer, and this is the first show about writing that actully made me once more (after 12 years of not writing) once more start writing.

Its easy to watch, enjoy and embrase the crazyness!!"
Jane the Virgin,Fresh and humorous,"It's presented in a comedic style that isn't meant to be taken seriously. I've seen others that commented that there was nothing funny about the situation and wondered why she didn't sue the doctor....as I stated....it is a COMEDY. If this were a reality show, it would have to involve lawyers, investigators and medical professionals. Nothing about this show feels like reality. It is presented as entertainment. I found it entertaining. It is based on an earlier Spanish version that had the lead character as a 17 year old girl, which is way more realistic if she is supposed to be a virgin. However the fact that the lead in this version is 24 adds to the humor. How many 24 year old educated attractive women in a serious relationship with a guy in law enforcement determined to stay a virgin until marriage could there be? Just saying....I think if you like a good mystery (this show also has suspense) and satire, I think this show is worth checking out. It doesn't hurt that all the actors are very attractive."
Jane the Virgin,Absolutely fell in love with this,"I started watching JTV because the trailer made it seem funny and I was instantly hooked. The plot line sounds crazy but the acting is brilliant, the cast really sell the chemistry, the friction etc.

The cast all get along so well in real life too (on Instagram) which makes you love the show even more.

Was gutted the show ended so soon but I think they ended on such a high note.

There's lots of laughs, drama and tears - it's got it all"
Jane the Virgin,Team Michael & Jane,"I love Michael and Jane love storyline but oh welll, it can be predicted how it going to end. I love how this story can twist from happy to sad with tears to thriller and more. Love it!"
Jane the Virgin,First season was hilarious and very well written,Loved the first season then your tied to characters and series has a good ending so worth watching through. Didn't like a few series storylines but overall eally liked it and found it very funny.
Jane the Virgin,Fun show. But I progressively hated Jane,"I enjoyed this show, but I have to say that I progressively hated Jane as a character. Not only does she lose the whole ""virgin"" thing very quickly, but then she just comes off as this entitled, know-it-all. Jane always has something to say about someone else's situation. She is never really a good friend. Jane constantly flip flops her feelings, it becomes nauseating. The far-fetched events of the final season (I won't spoil it), only show how fake she is when it comes to her relationships. I understand it's shot in a telenovela style, but Petra easily is the best and most relatable character. Another example of Jane being selfish is when Petra is asked to write her own book, and Jane says out of the side of her mouth during a meal one time that Petra isn't a writer.. Jane was solely published because her father guaranteed to pay back any losses if the book didn't sell 10k copies, which it didn't. Jane thinks entirely to much of herself because she didn't ""crumble her flower"".

Petra and Rogelio are the characters that really made this series go to 5 years.

Its a good binge watch, but besides Petra, don't expect any character development."

Jane the Virgin,A soap any like other,"I have a disclaimer, ""I do not like soaps at all"". Every soap that I accidentally saw growing up with my family made me realize why I hated soaps. Why am I telling all this? Because ""Jane the Virgin"", is unlike any other soap I have ever seen. Most soaps are boring, tedious, unnecessary twists, stretched, overly dramatic and too serious or trying too hard to be funny. The best thing about this show is that it avoids all of these mistakes.

This show can be taken and is a good satire on soaps in general and telenovellas in particular but it also has merits of its own. It doesn't solely rely on making fun on other soaps to be successful. It is genuinely funny and has enough twists to keep the audience engaged. Also the little messages the show gives in a few moments in every other episode are real and relatable to us average mortals.

The show also has a wonderful take on life in general. It tells us that we should not take our lives too seriously and not everything is in our control. We think most of the times that we are the leaders of our destiny and we can shape our lives any way we want. Yes to a certain extent we can but we should never rule our environment and the part played by it in our destiny. The show even goes a step beyond this general realization that I stated, it teaches us how with all the unexpected turns and twists in life we keep growing and moving on and life never stops. This is the sort of outlook on life the show promotes and it is a very good message in my opinion. Every one should watch this show! :)"
A Choo,The Weirdest Three Stooges Short of All,Comentario no disponible
A Choo,Not the worst Stooges short...,"""Cuckoo on A Choo Choo"" has often been called the worst Three Stooges short. While it's not their best film, the uniqueness of this work in the series begs for a second look.

Larry and Shemp have swiped a railroad car called Schmow, with Larry hoping to marry his girlfriend. Shemp is a rich drunk who would rather woo an imaginary canary than the sister of Larry's girlfriend. Moe plays a railroad detective who discovers the car.

""Cuckoo on a Choo Choo"" is a broad satire on ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Larry satires Marlon Brando's role in that movie, and it is a delight to see him in a role other than middle Stooge. Shemp's drunkard character adds some comedic highlights as well.

True, the film is budget-thin (the streetcar is basically the only set) and tedious at times. But the satire and the broad humor make this film unique (much like the uniqueness of their first Columbia film, ""Woman Haters,"" which included rhyming dialogue).

This is not the worst film in the series (the racist ""The Yoke's on Me,"" which shows Japanese-Americans that escaped from a California relocation camp, surely rates that honor). I encourage Stooge fans to seek out this hard-to-find film and compare it with ""The Yoke's on Me"" or half of the Joe Besser shorts for awfulness. ""Cuckoo on A Choo Choo"" offers enough funny business and satire to appeal to the casual Stooge fan. 6 out of 10."
A Choo,Love it or hate it,"That appears to be the general attitude regarding ""Cuckoo on a Choo-Choo"". This episode draws a great stir among stooge-heads, pro or con. Myself, I'm on the ""pro"" side. The weirdness of the ""imaginary canary"" doesn't seem to farfetched if you keep in mind this is a Three Stooges comedy and the fact that once Moe gets on the train, the regular dynamic of Moe bossing the other two around, quickly settles in. I would recommend any stooge fan watch this short and see for yourself what side of the fence you may fall on. Grade: B+"
A Choo,Review,"I must be one of the few people that likes this short. I guess you have to understand what The Stooges are making fun of here. This film makes fun of A Streetcar Named Desire, hence the reason Larry is trying imitate Marlon Brando and the torn T-Shirt, and Harvey, which explains Shemp seeing and animal no one else can see and Shemp imitating James Stewart when he is talking to the canary. Coincidently, Victoria Horne who plays Roberta in this film appeared in Harvey. My favorite gag is when Larry tells Moe, ""If you don't want to lose Roberta, you'd better play ball with me."" I guess this is 50's slag for You better Listen to me. Then after that, Moe whips out a ball and he and Larry toss it at each other. Although there are better shorts, this one is ok."
A Choo,weird Three Stooges and I like it,"Larry and Shemp are living in a stolen railroad car. Lenora won't marry Larry until Shemp marries her sister Roberta first as dictated by family tradition. All Shemp does is get drunk. Railroad investigator Moe tracks down the stolen railway car. He's actually been searching for Roberta who turned down his marriage proposal. Meanwhile, Shemp is hallucinating a giant canary.

This one stands out a little more with the canary and the skunk. They do plenty of gorilla suit characters, but this is a giant canary-man. It's a surreal ridiculous sight. It's weird and I like it. It's mildly humorous. The skunk is also unusual. They used a real skunk at times. I think they can de-sense the skunk, but it still smells."
A Choo,Pretty strange!,"This is well known as one of the most controversial Stooges shorts. Some say it's the worst they ever did, while others defend it. What most agree on, however, is that it's really STRANGE.

I don't think it's particularly good or bad. In fact, I find it somewhat reminiscent of earlier Stooges shorts that satirized things that people today may or may not be familiar with. ""Men In Black"", ""You Nazty Spy!"" and ""I'll Never Heil Again"" were similarly satirical, and (more to the point) similarly surrealistic and plot-less. It also anticipates the different-in-a-not-so-good-way features of some Besser shorts, showing once again that Besser didn't make the Stooge train head downhill -- he merely hopped onto it when it was already heading that way.

Still, some parts did make me laugh -- at least parts near the beginning involving Shemp. The line ""Horrible, but I like it!"" was funny. So were the weird music & sound effects whenever someone took a drink -- or at least they were funny until they'd happened too many times.

The weirdest thing is the imaginary canary. The most nonsensical thing is Shemp, finding himself in trouble, calling out ""Moe!"" as in some other short -- but in this one Moe's character is some stranger he's barely noticed! The most unfunny thing is the blond lady, whose loud, annoying crying and running away didn't always have a coherent motivation. Then again, there isn't much coherent about this one anyway. And maybe there doesn't have to be."
A Choo,A Victim of 'Soicumstances'?,"I am among those who are drawn towards this bizarre Stooges short; certainly because of the reference to the ""Penciltucky R.R. Co."" (nyuk, nyuk, nyuk) and the railroad car named ""Schmow,"" among others, plus this not being a ""typical"" Stooges entry. (And in this film in particular, Larry looks almost like a hippie version of former New York Mayor Ed Koch, especially when you consider the longer hair.)

But one has to wonder if this being judged among the worst of their offerings has as much to do with what was going on behind-the-scenes at Columbia's short-subjects department at the time this was being produced, as anything else in the film. This was from the period after Jules White became the sole producer/director of the Stooges (a situation, or 'soicumstance' if you will, which would stand until the closing of the short-subjects unit in 1958), following the firing of producer Hugh McCollum and the resignation of director Edward Bernds (all of whose directorial efforts of the Stooges were under McCollum) out of loyalty to his just-sacked boss and mentor. It is agreed among many Stooge-o-philes that the quality of their shorts plummeted mightily after White took full control. (To be sure, the Stooges' films weren't Shakespeare or anything else even slightly resembling ""high art""; but for what they were, opinions differ among fans on when the quality decline took place - Curly's career-ending stroke and Shemp replacing him, the aforementioned backroom studio politics, etc.)

The question thus has to be asked (and probably unlikely to be answered, since almost all the participants are now dead, with the possible exception of actress Patricia Wright who played ""Lenora""): How would the McCollum/Bernds duo have tackled such an unorthodox, offbeat script as this? Bernds is usually regarded by Stooge aficionados as helming some of their better entries, and especially his dealings with the actors and working around them (i.e. the final Curly shorts he crafted, where he took into account Curly's illness when making them, unlike White who merely shifted the action towards Moe and Larry; not to mention, in general, White's forcing everybody to work according to his idea of what ""worked"" in two-reel comedy)."
A Choo,Well...it's different.,"Is this the worst Three Stooges comedy ever made? No, not really. It's not as painful to watch as some of the last shorts to feature a very ill Curly Howard. But it is the most peculiar one they ever did. Larry is essentially imitating Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalsi, right down to the torn t-shirt (and Brando looks a LOT better shirtless). He at least he seems to be enjoying proving that he can do more than get slapped. Shemp does what he can with the ridiculous role of a drunkard whose DTs are restricted to a gigantic canary--somebody in a really dreadful bird costume--while Moe plays the antagonist of the piece, the sort of part that was usually filled by Vernon Dent. So what gives? One can only speculate that this script was not written for the Stooges. The Columbia Short Subject department often re-filmed the same scripts, virtually unchanged, with different comics or teams. So the most charitable explanation for this short is that it has been prepared for another studio team, but for whatever reason given to the Stooges. Maybe it seemed like a good idea that the time."
A Choo,"horrible, but I like it","A running gag in this short is Shemp (or in one scene, Larry) guzzling from the brown jug, doing the usual double takes as we hear the familiar train/whistle sound effects, then remarking ""horrible, but I like it"". A perfect way to sum up my feelings about this short. Sure the plot may seem a 'bit' absurd, but what are we watching here, Hamlet. I doubt any of these 190 films were made with the idea of improving our minds.

Larry's girl in this film says Shemp is filthy with money. I guess he's the definition of ""eccentric millionaire"" if he likes to spend all his time living with a hobo like Larry on a stolen boxcar. :-)

A Choo,"Average, but weird short","This short is extremely weird, but some of the gags are quite funny, but some of the gags are just too silly. The idea about Shemp seeing an imaginary canary is absolutely ridiculous and very silly. Unfortunately, Shemp is not that funny in this one because he spends too much time acting drunk than actually being funny. But Moe and Larry do a pretty good job. Overall: C+"
A Choo,"Bizarre, Beyond Bizzare","The most bizarre and controversial Three Stooges short of all time.

I truly can't properly rate it. I really don't know if I like it or not.

Shemp is my favourite Stooge and this is ""His""episode. Shemp gets a lot of solo screen time, more than any other Three Stooges short film. He spends most of it here being drunk/intoxicated.

I really can't believe this script was approved or green lit by any executive. The only meaning I can understand about this film is it might be a metaphor for alcoholism. Beyond bizarre.

Casual observers will be turned off completely, and won't discover the true genius of the Stooges. This is for die-hard ""Stoogeaholics"" only."
A Choo,Not the worst Stooges short!,"This short has the rep of being the Stooges worst but (IMO) that is simply not true.

All one needs to do is watch shorts like ""The Yokes on Me"", ""False Alarms"", ""Flat Foot Stooges"" & many of the Joe Besser shorts (especially the 2 shorts where the Stooges sister dies & comes back as a horse) to realize this.

It's my opinion that had ""Flat Foot Stooges"", ""The Yokes on Me"", & ""False Alarms"" had Shemp or Joe in it instead of Curly people would be more likely to see just how awful those 3 shorts are. But because fan favorite Curly is in it these 3 shorts get a pass.

It is my opinion that ""The Yokes on Me"" is the worst Curly short. And it is also by far the worst short the Stooges ever did."
A Choo,Bizarre Stooge short.,"The whole time of this short is spent in a stopped railroad car, and that's pretty much how the comedy is too. This is a ""minimalist"" Stooge short because there are no scene changes, no varied support cast, no foils like Vernon Dent to run up against, and the Stooges are all playing separate characters, not a team. Shemp plays a drunk through out the whole time, which wears thin after about five minutes. I don't know what Larry's position is in all this mess, and Moe is gruff as always as a detective. None of this gels. It's as if Chaplin or Orson Welles were directing this as an experimental film, and they had their goof ups too. This short it totally miss able."
A Choo,What was the writing drinking?,Comentario no disponible
A Choo,Not the average Stooge short,"CUCKOO ON A CHOO CHOO is a very bizarre Three Stooges short. The gags are all rather silly and dumb other than genuinely funny, and the Stooges act stranger than usual here. I think it's one of the worst ones I've ever seen, and I never was a fan of the shorts that have the boys playing different characters. That comes off too forced and drama-like.

Grade: D-"
A Choo,Bums and birds,Comentario no disponible
A Choo,The Absolute WORST!,"Of the entire 190 shorts of the Stooges' career, this one is the bottom-of-the-barrel WORST of any of them! I can't exactly pinpoint where they stopped being truly funny, and began to become a parody of themselves, (it had nothing whatever to do with Jerry's leaving and the re-entry of Shemp), but perhaps it started when they ran out of original ideas and began doing remakes of earlier story lines, (some of which were quite good, in fact). But this one is beyond just plain SILLY, it's degrading and insulting to both them and the viewer. The storyline makes no sense whatsoever, even in the surreal comedic world of the Stooges. I've been told by others that it may be an allegory on alcoholism, with drunken Shemp's hallucinating the big bird, but that's pure BULLSHIT, it's just STUPID, and I'm surprised that Mssrs. Horowitz and Fine even agreed to stoop this low for such a lousy piece! Unfortunately, it was filmed and released, and became the stereotype of the Stooges for anyone with a negative viewpoint on them & their act. It's only saving grace is as a comparison to their GOOD work, and it's sad to see how far down they'd gone! Beyond even gratuitous violence for its own sake, like shooting each other with guns for no apparent reason, many of us wish it had never been made. Whose idea was this trash, anyway? Felix Adler? What a waste of talent, money, and time!"
A Choo,An interesting change of pace,Comentario no disponible
A Choo,Definitely the Worst of the Stooges Shorts,"This short is without question the worst of the Stooges shorts. The problem is that the big bird quickly becomes irritating and Shemp's drunk act grows very old. Larry used to watch this short over and over again when he was in the old actor's home and liked it best because he thought he looked like Marlon Brando from ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Avoid if possible."
The Mechanism,"Neither left nor right. Let's face it! Unfortunately, corruption is all over it!","Just reading through the different reviews here and you can get an idea how the audience is divided (or lost) accusing the series of being biased to the left or right political parties propaganda. But this is because the country's population is divided and blinded now and cannot see anything beyond their political parties agenda and ideologies

What the series show in reality, specially in the second season, is that corruption in Brazil dates as far as democracy and that, unfortunately, it is not an exclusivity of the left or right parties, but all over the country's political system.

But by doing this, saying everybody is corrupt, it fails to please both sides interests, because if corruption is all over it, there are no victims or villains, everybody is to blame.

But contemporary Brazilians are unable to see this, just because the polarization is convenient for both sides, and politics became passion, just like soccer in Brazil, with supporters hating and accusing each other all the time, unable to see or recognize their own team mistakes.

As for the series quality, it is a quite enjoyable well crafted and well acted series, although it lingers the events a little too long sometimes for dramatic purposes, or the lack of new events in the Car Wash operation.

Watch it with an open mind and get over your own political convictions."
The Mechanism,Beware of all the noise surrounding show's reviews and ratings,"This series talks about a very polarizing and hot topic in Brazil. The Car Wash investigation is still ongoing, and nearly half the country believes some of its allegations are ""fake news"". As a result, despite the show's bipartisan view, many party loyalists are furious about the show and have flooded it with 1 star ratings and bad reviews. On the other hand, people who agree with the show's message are giving it an overly good rating without judging the actual quality of the show. Overall, the show follows the same formula as Padilha's more famous Narcos, so if you're a fan, chances are you will enjoy this one as well. The only difference is the lack of action-packed gun fight scenes and focus on politics and money laundering, but the narration and the police investigation aspects are still there. The show really takes off after the end of episode 2, where it loses the introductory aspect, so I recommend making it past those first episodes before making any conclusions.

The show does not portray any of the real life persons and parties as super heroes. In fact, it has an openly anti-ideology overall message, and every character in this show has significant flaws, so personally it's really hard for me to believe this show would be somehow biased towards any party or ideology. My guess is if you believe the facts involving the car wash operation are legitimate, and don't happen to be loyal to any of the people who inspired the show, you'll find this a great political thriller with interesting characters (some entirely fictional, some based on real people) and beautiful cinematography of multiple Brazilian cities."
The Mechanism,Awesome,It's grate police insvestigation and explain really well the Brazilian bad system and corrupt.
The Mechanism,One of the best TV series to come out of Brazil,"This show really grabbed me. I almost never binge-watch and this was one of the few shows I did. Everyone has a motive and the characters aren't flat.

Don't listen to the Ministry of Truth. This show is not a political piece. It's actually as unbiased as it can be. Too bad the facts don't leave much room for tweaking.

As for calling it ""fake news""... It's not a news piece. It's a TV show. Right at the beginning of each episode it says it was loosely based on a true story. I guess some people just can't read (which is why they believe in fairy tales).

I just hope Netflix doesn't budge to the naysayers and gives us a second season. This is truly one of the best TV shows to come out of Brazil."
The Mechanism,Fantastic,"Incredible political thriller based on the current situation in Brazil. More instigating than House of Cards.

It shows the reality behind the scenes of the politics of the largest South American country and how it is fought."
The Mechanism,Padilha is brilliant! Excellent!!!,"Padilha understands deeply the reality of the country and knows how to adapt it to the fiction. Unfortunately, sometimes, the reality here is worse..."
The Mechanism,Brazil is not for amateurs,"The series tells the story of an investigation from the federal police and the judiciary system from Brazil called Lava-Jato (Car Wash in english). This investigation has showed how deep the corruption is on brazilian government. Many supporters of the Worker´s Party are saying the series is biased. Yes, it is, but it doesn't run away of criticizing the other side also. So, watch the series and search the internet to form your opinion. There are good sources from both sides. At least you will understand why brazilian people would always joke about how House of Cards was soft in comparison to brazilian politics."
The Mechanism,Absolutely fantastic!,This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen six episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. This is a very classy production. Everything from the detective who is the narrative voice to the quality of the camera work. The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. Good job!
The Mechanism,awsome experience,"Intrigating t.v show that criticize not only brazilan political system but also all latin america corruption model. As you can notice on reviews below, many are giving a low score for the show based on what they call ""fake news"" about a popular leader in Brazil. The truth however is that despite the show is not 100% loyal to the real events (as expected for a tv show, not a documentary), it gives enough information to understand how the entire system is corrupted. The show is thrilling and educative."
The Mechanism,Irresponsible.,"Nevermind the fact that the series lies and put quotes from the extreme right wing as something our ex-president said, just to hurt his image and make him look like the biggest corrupt in Brazil, when he isn't. This is irresponsible, badly acted and just tries to cash in the hate for the left wing, while trying to look as a critic for our politics, when it overlooks everything the right wing did, and defending the worst politicians."
The Mechanism,It was like french fries without ketchup,"If you are expecting it like Narcos or other crime thrillers, I have bad news for you. Many will be misled by the trailer but it actually is somewhat around narrative and hopeless twists.

Brazil is a big country but the scandal didn't hit worldwide like other true events, so I was not sold to the series facts from the beginning just like every other viewers.

Because of this weak reputation of the story, Netflix should have ended it in the first season but left its audiences on a huge cliffhanger by not finishing the series. No one's waiting for the 2nd season and there's no anticipation. Even if it gets cancelled, still nobody would complain.

Season 1's direction is pretty good. From videography to acting. I was expecting to be alienated by the acting styles of a different culture but I did not. I am really impressed with that.

If you have spare time, I will suggest you to watch it. You won't feel worthless nor disappointed or satisfied. It will be like weird mixed feelings after watching it, trust me. You won't be able to tell whether you liked it or loved or hated it. That's how this show is; it's like a hot chick you pass by randomly and after 30 minutes, you won't even remember it.

Netflix or production house didn't invest money for fake reviews for this show, that's why the rating is low or maybe that's how the rating should work; appear original. At least legit 7 ratings are better than fake 8+ ratings *cought*cough*cough*MIND HUNTERS*cough*cough*cough*.

Anyway, give this series a try."
The Mechanism,totally real facts in Brazil,"A great series, which shows all the corruption installed in Brazil in recent years. Only those who have pet thugs, and we know who owns them, complains about the series. Usually people against capitalism, but loves Netflix with a Coke on the side. Brazil is rotten with corruption and we know who the culprits are and the series shows this well."
The Mechanism,Very good show and draws light on a very serious topic,"Why I think this is a great show

characters are well constructed and have enough of a personal angle to keep you engaged
narrator adds a lot to the story from his perspective and helps creating tension, mistery and food for thought in a lot of scenes
basically draws much of the story line from reality (all names from actual Brazilian people are changed, but easily identifiable) and creates a drama out of it. This shows just of impressive the corruption scandal was in Brazil
show is produced by the same Team who did Narcos, enough said


Who should watch this"
The Mechanism,"Disregarding the political theme, really nice show, the same level as narcos","There are ome facts that aren't true, but the they did show the ""this is a fiction"" disclaimer. Really enjoyed watching it, last time I had that much fun was with Narcos! Congrats Padilha and Netflix!"
The Mechanism,Another Padilha's Masterpiece,"Before I start my review take this as a fact; this is nothing like City of God, neither Elite Troop even using some actors from both shows. Being that said, you should expect a heavy and complex plot about Brazilian political scenary since the begining of the operation Lava Jato (Car Wash), with politicians, corporations, public institutions that actually exist and are part of the huge corruption scheme in Brazil. For example, MFP (MPF - Ministério Público Federal), Polícia Federativa (Polícia Federal), Petrobrasil (PETROBRAS), Miller & Brecht (Odebrecht) and many others. After being completely seduced by this show, you will be caught thinking on how corrupt you were in your ""small"" acts in your daily life and how you could not be a bad example like those corrupt politicians. Of course it's not a completely accurate series, and what really disturbed me more was the fact that the delegado federal (Federal Deputy/Xeriff/Federal Police Chief) is represented by 2 persons wich actually do the work of agents! The Delegados are much more like the masterminds behind the scene, the experts in criminal law and who structure the case so the MPF can represent in court to the federal judge. they do not chase proof like that in the show, so, it's a dramatical change so the series would not be too much in the office, since there are no shots or fights in this show.

To finally end my review, I must create an index to you of the more important government institutions in the show and what they do in a brief way. 1- Polícia Federal (Federal Police) -> They investigate and create the case to be represented after by MPf in court. 2- MPF (Federal Prosecution) -> they take the case from Federal Police and take it to the justice (federal court) making accusations based in the criminal law, producing more proofs and making deals when necessary. 3- Federal Court/ Judge -> judge the MPF's case, accept the order for some proofs like telephone tapping and many others and all the things a normal judge would do. So, as you can see, things are not that easy to be done here, all because we respect our constitution wich preserve the due process of law."
The Mechanism,The truth hurts,Some people have had their brains washed right here in Brazil. Only the zumbis who belives blindly on thiefs will rate this as a bad one piece. They kinda belive and cooperate for the secular game from politicians here. The rulers always say that charges on them are lies from rivals and supporters repeat that argument without questioning nothing. Their words here on IMDB reflect that. Our country is tired of so much robbery.
The Mechanism,The level of corruption in Brazil is one of the worst in the world,"I have lived in many countries around the world, and I have lived in Brazil for almost two years (my spouse is Brazilian). I am always AMAZED when many people in Brazil defend the very clearly corrupt and nasty politicians and leaders who have literally torn apart the country over the past 20 years... Most of these leaders (mostly from PT) have all been convicted in front of the high courts, there is nothing left to defend. What are we arguing about?

This series is a fantastic exploration of trying to bring justice within a corrupt system - It is very difficult and costly for the people trying to bring justice.

I have watched 3 episodes so far and it is very good (what else would you expect from the creator of Narcos and Elite Squad?). I'm hooked!"
The Mechanism,"Fantastic production, we are living in the golden age of series",This is such a quality production. Its cinema quality in every aspect. I've seen six episodes so far but if this show keep this up I give it an even higher grade. Netflix is now really starting to compete with HBO and this is much better than Netflix anchor House of Cards for example. This is a very classy production. Everything from the detective who is the narrative voice to the quality of the camera work. The actors are spot on and the scenes are amazing. Good job!
The Mechanism,Trully what Happened,Don't trust all the haters and Lula's widows they compact with all the corruption and robbery made with the last government.
The Mechanism,it gets better from the second episode,"Don't give up this great series; it gets better in the middle of the second episode and takes off from there. It's a rollercoaster ride through the political and bribery games widespread played in Brazil. The world needs to know how much pain and suffer were inflicted in the Brazilian people by the bad politicians fuelled by the greediness of almost 15 years under the Labour party. The two former presidents of Brazil claim that they have been victimized by a coup from bad people It actually the bad administration that both performed that caused one of the biggest economies of the world, to flop too brutally. The direction is a bit chaotic but the movie happens regardless."
The Mechanism,Full of fake news,Poor sound quality. unfamiliar characters and full of fake news to show their point of view. zero grade
The Mechanism,"Confusing, and dabbles in melodrama - but good overall","As everybody knows, this series is based on the real events of the investigation ""Lava Jato"" - it's written based on the book of the same name, and its pilot episode is titled that too. ""Lava Jato"" seems to have raised as much dust in Latin America as the Arab Spring has in Middle East, minus the warfare. As a result, it seems that opinions of the show, and of each season, are sharply divided among Brazilians based on their political views, and what they believe each season's message to be. I'm a person rather distant from Brazilian politics, and thus cannot quite speak to the accuracy or neutrality of the production - only to its quality. And it is... alright.

I have learnt some things about Brazilian politics and corruption from the show, but a lot (especially in Season 2) was quite confusing. I fear I might not have been pausing enough to try to understand a particular scheme, stance or piece of evidence - perhaps you just need to have followed the real-world events from day 1, or at least keep a Wikipedia timeline handy; and have knowledge of Brazilian law to boot. Some of it becomes understandable with some effort - the finale of Season 1 has an awesome scene which helps - but on some points I'm still confused.

""O mecanismo"" has a strong fixation on relationship drama in a series that you'd think would be about the broader picture. We learn about families of nearly all of the main characters, and witness quite a few of them randomly having sex (mostly in S1). I'm not sure if it's the creators checking some boxes on their thriller-making guide, or just Brazilian culture manifesting. Style-wise, the series has a noirish narration (some lines bordering on the absurd or devoid of meaning), and is a slower boil, with a lot hinging on whether the criminals are going to make a mistake or start cooperating with the law. The characters' behaviour and/or decision-making are not always clear - I could never keep track which investigator was enthused and which was depressed, and who placed hopes on what course of action, and which criminal hoped for what way out: everything is a relative blur, which I guess is kinda bad?.. Finally, the camerawork is often very stylish and cool - you have a lot of still, centred shots that ooze gravity and atmosphere. The editing is a mixed bag.

Overall, S2 is marginally better than S1 but more by Brownian motion than anything, and there are some inconsistencies between them - perhaps at most one could say that S2 takes itself a bit more seriously and has a grander scale of events to work with. If you're looking for a political crime thriller, give both a watch - and potentially await new seasons, if they're going to come about (as ""Lava Jato"" has been forced to close this month, on one hand they wouldn't have as much to work off with after catching up to the current state of affairs, but honestly the story is flexible enough to follow any Brazilian corruption case straight off the headlines, so who knows).

(I've watched ""Lava Jato"" in English and the other 15 episodes in Russian)

My ratings by season: S1: 5 S2: 6"
The Mechanism,Inspiring and will raise some eyebrow.,"Despite of the 7th episode where a misreading of the political spectrum happens in the worst possible way, the show is awesome!"
The Mechanism,Middleground between Narcos and Ozark - a B+,"Definitely better than Ozark and worse than Narcos.

It's Ok, I would say. If you are addicted to thrillers involving corruption schemes like me, it's worth watching. However, do not put your expectations so high, because the series will not surprise you or make you claim desperately for the next season.

One thing that I noted is that the series waste time exploiting love stories between the charachters. From my perspective, the audience of this sort of series does not want to watch romances. Instead, it would be better if the series focused more on the turnoarounds starred by the Federal Police and the Judge in face of the corruption schemes done by politicians to stall the operations and avoid prisons.

I would give 7 stars, but as it is based on a true story, which makes things more interesting, I gave one more point."
The Mechanism,The Reality Hurts,"Careful with all the fake commentaries made by corrupt and zombies, the series tell us the truths and what happened on the biggest operation and corruption scandal in the history of Brazil's government so far. The most interesting thing is to see that leftys know how to write in english, google translate is a saviour to those people that neither portuguese can understand."

A Beautiful Life,Worth seeing this romantic Danish film for the last song alone.,"This is the story of a Danish fisherman turned reluctant pop star. Elliot is a hard working fisherman who was raised in the foster system and has the simple dream of fixing up his parents sailboat to sail around the world. He has a wonderful and honest boss who rightfully questions his devotion to his childhood friend Oliver. Oliver's dream is to make it big in the music industry, but unfortunately he doesn't have the talent to get him there. While helping Oliver out at his gig, Elliot gets discovered by the widow of a famous rock star. She seems to think her still grieving daughter (who is a producer) needs a pet project and Elliot is that project.

The rest as they say is history. This is a slow moving love story with some beautiful songs. I am a big fan of great lyrics and I think this film is worth watching for the final song alone (the scene too...but it was the song that had the tears running).

This is a recommendation for all the romantics out there and my review is based on watching the film in it's original Danish language with English subtitles."
A Beautiful Life,A Star is Born Sans a Bodyguard,"Don't expect too much because this is a light romantic movie. The main characters are not well-developed. True. Nonetheless, there's tension between them which should count for something. Elliot and Lilly have personal issues of their own. The movie doesn't quite tell whether these are resolved at the end but the viewer can take his pick. If you believe in the lyrics of Elliot's last song, you'd say it will be a happy ending.

What stands out, of course, is Christopher's original music which I enjoyed. Seldom do you watch a movie where the lead actor also composes the songs he sings in the movie.

By no means is the story unique because the theme has been used by earlier films that are even topbilled by bigger, better known actors/singers like A Star is Born and Bodyguard. Still, the movie is enjoyable in its own right."
A Beautiful Life,Sweet film,"Danish singer Christopher Lund Nissen, aka Christopher, composed and performed the soundtrack for this story of a fisherman with a troubled past who is discovered while playing a gig as support for his best friend Oliver. Christopher, with a sculpted face like that of a Greek god combined with a vulnerable angel, sings his heart out in this dramatic tale of creative and career success, love, and loss. Sometimes a 7 is the perfect film for the moment. I was engaged in the story, liked the supporting cast who were also very strong, enjoyed the music, and thought that Christopher nailed his role. Sweet film."
A Beautiful Life,Harmonious Melodies and Simple Romance,"Stumbling upon the Danish movie ""A Beautiful Life"" on OTT was a pleasant surprise. Elliot, the lead guy and a Danish singer, steals hearts with his amazing voice. Each song resonates, adding a delightful layer to the narrative. The chemistry between Elliot and Lilly is charming, bringing a sweet touch to the storyline.

While the acting by the cast is commendable, the film falls short on depth in its storytelling. It leaves you wishing for more. You can get a 'A star is born' vibe. However, it is a nice one-time watch, thanks to the captivating musical moments and the genuine charm of the lead actors."
A Beautiful Life,Hope this movie is for you,"The trailer is very representative of the movie. Down-on-his-luck good looking fellow had a chance at stardom (and love). The plot is both cliche and yet probably true in real life.

The first half is well-grounded but the second half feels rushed. The music is good although it never reveals the background story of each song. Acting is uneven and the movie is a reminder not to eat too much processed food as most of the actors have warts.

It is what it said on the tin. It's not trying to be Once or Sing Street and no Hemsworth brothers could sing and star in these type of romantic movie, I'll take it. A wonderful lazy Sunday movie while you're sipping tea and having biscuits."

A Beautiful Life,Good,"Don't listen to the negative reviews. Very nice story about a troubled fisherman with musical talent who gets discovered instead of his friend.

In there is a deeper story of why he is troubled, the relationship he has with his record producer, the baggage they each carry. His friend is a big opportunistic jerk, but for some reason, probably because of all of the hurt and bad stuff Elliott has endured, he has a real connection with Oliver and wants to stick by him.

Acting is good, music is amazing. I find the foreign films always do it better. Reminds me of A Star is Born but the 2.0 version.

I recommend it!"

A Beautiful Life,Christopher is good but the story is not,"I watched this movie to see Christopher acting as I've only known him as a musician and singer. And his acting surprised me positively. He portrayed Elliot with very much charisma and very beliveable portraying a troubled Young man. I would love to see him in a movie with more substance though. The story was very predictable and has been told a million times before. The whole background story was way more interesting than the rise to fame. The movie is very nicely filmed, nicely shot scenes and beautiful catchy songs, which I think will be a hit this summer on the Danish festivals if Christopher is touring. Over all an okay watch."
A Beautiful Life,"Ignore the bad review, this is a lovely movie","I don't get all the low star reviews. But it seems to happen more and more with subtle movies that rely more on the emotions they convey and all the things that are being said in the silences. I feel people are so accustomed to flashy super hero movies and probably scroll on their phone's endlessly while watching that they fail to see nuance.

I watched the movie in Danish with subtitles, which is my recommendation for any movie. Dubbed is not the same, even when the actors themselves do it. There is rawness and depth in the original performance that no dubbing can ever convey. It also means you actually have to watch the movie and can't do anything else at the same time.

This movie is foremost a music movie, it lives by Christopher's songs that are well written for the story. The story is about loss and the impact it has on people's lives. Overcoming grief, especially when it's a child's grief and the parents died way too early, is so very hard. Elliot is trapped in his grief. While it is painful it's also familiar and somehow safe, because he has been in that place of grief for such a long time. Letting go of that grief and opening to new relationships, new people who care about him, seeing all the people who love him, is the challenge he needs to overcome.

One of my favorite scenes is when is fisherman boss delivers him to the producer's house and fires him. There is much love in him, pushing Elliot towards a good thing, but it takes Elliot forever to see that.

Every character deals with loss and grief in this movie. And it's very interesting so see how different they deal with it. But watch for yourself to see."

Production quality is good, cinematography is good and the music is amazing...but the story and script are not well made.

Something is just off. Its too cliche and too much drama for nothing for example at the beginning. It just doesnt feel right and real. Just for the sake of drama the characters seem to say and do things to build tension. Feels to rushed. The romance happens way to fast - One minute she is pissed all the time and doesn't respect him at all, the next minute... Nothing is really authentic, except when he starts to sing! They tried to hard to put as much drama as possible into it. The only thing missing was a deadly illness...

I really wanted to love the movie, to feel with the characters , but it was just average. A film for cozy sundays. Could have been so much more. The chemistry with the female lead role is also not believable enough for me.

Christopher is a massive talent. The songs are great. Watch it if you like cliche easy flat movies and love this kind of music."
A Beautiful Life,My family is going nuts because I won't stop playing the soundtrack,"I happened upon this movie and now I can't get it, the music, or Christopher's abs out of my head!! I've literally been streaming the soundtrack for four days straight. ""Led Me To You"" may be the most persistent earworm I've ever heard. I'm not really into pop music, which most of his older material seems to be, but this soundtrack has just enough acoustic guitar to justify me loving it. Sure, the movie could have been better, the characters developed more, but it's good enough to watch a couple times in a weekend. I should know. It won't win any Oscars, but I'm hoping it wins Christopher an American Tour!! I'll buy a ticket!!"
A Beautiful Life,Exactly what it looks like,"Good songs and great voice but that's mostly it.

Can fill an evening / afternoon if you want a romcom with some music in it and you don't feel like searching.

A classical romcom with music as expected with an acceptable character synergy but a real lack of work on the story.

The movie feels quite lazy especially in terms of the main character backstory. There was potential in the central character if he was given an actually good backstory and evolution. The other character actually has more backstory but it also feels lackluster and poorly exploited. The movie just sticks to the classical trope of romantic movies with music as part of the plot.

PLUS: the music MINUS: predictable, lack of main character development."
A Beautiful Life,Don't see the negatives with this one,"I truly enjoyed this movie and I am glad that I did not look up Elliott until after the movie. I did not know that he's an actual singer/songwriter and that for me made it a MAJOR plus! When I saw the credits and just saw his name using just his first I knew he was the real deal and man can he sing! Unlike the negative reviews here, I watched a believable movie of a hesitant lost soul trying to navigate an injured past and if anything the parallel was drawn between an unfortunate soul with no trappings (him) to a unfortunate soul with all the trappings (her) hence the love story that developed believably & nicely, so what a slow pace? Any faster would have been not natural as the pace the movie was taking to develop the character & narrative. It was paced with just life as we know it, nothing glitzy or glamorous but real. Amazing, but interesting how many can watch the same movie with such diverse takeaways, but for me, I loved it, became a fan of Christopher, what a voice and a singing talent. It is relatable and simplistic with realistic life complexities. Worth a watch for sure!"
A Beautiful Life,Very Predictable with some bad story lines,"When a movie starts with some unreasonable story lines, it loses credibility fast. For example, the main character defends his friend who gets attacked by a guy with a knife, and the friend is angry with him and totally cuts him off. LOL. Just dumb. Later, the main character is told to go to the house of a famous musician given that he's got a good voice and has great potential. He refuses to do so, who knows why, but a friend he works with forces him to go. Just dumb. Not realistic.

I made it through the part where he falls in love with a producer lady, but I knew where the plot was heading. Without seeing the rest, fame is going to get to him and it will be reminiscent of her dad, who put fame over her and eventually killed himself. But somehow the fisherman turned singer we'll be the better version and they'll live happily ever after. Am I right? Just dumb. :)"
A Beautiful Life,Cute underdog movie,"Although I agree with the previous reviews and I did in fact watch it on a lazy rainy Sunday morning, I believe if you just watch the movie without anyone hyping it up to be a great movie you can appreciate it for what it is... a good underdog, turning into a star/love movie. Yes it is a cliche movie and it's been done before, but I've always liked a movie with an underdog and I enjoyed his music. Also agree after reading the other reviews it would've made a great series to stretch it out a bit more so it didn't seem so rushed and to get to know the characters better.

It would've been nice to see the ending played out after his last song."
A Beautiful Life,Cliché-filled romance,"A very cliché-filled romance with a VERY cliched ""twist"" at the end. Nothing new or different really. The story itself has potential, but it feels rushed in the film. It could have had potential as a series, so the characters could be more developed. You never really get to know them and most of them appear unlikeable. The things you do find out about them are (for the most part) just something another character drops and is not introduced naturally. However, the songs are good and Christopher is an amazing singer - and a surprisingly good actor. SO if you're into downright cliché-filled romantic movies - this one's for you."
A Beautiful Life,Elegantly Integration Life's Story with the Story of Song,"This has a slow complicated burn but builds beautifully exploring the messy and beautiful parts of our life. The songs come at poignant moments and show the resilience when those around you believe in you more than yourself. There are moments you want to turn away as it represents our own personal demons and toxic relationships.

The songs by themselves, each on there own are on point and I will be adding to my Spotify list. But how they merge with the story give me hope that such beautiful movies like this exist.

This movie is well worth making it to the end and experiencing the up and downs through music, ultimately you are rewarded with a well rounded movie."
A Beautiful Life,So much potential,"I mean, there was so much potential, but this film is really bad. The writing is a catastrophe. The story and all characters are so shallow. You just don't feel with the characters and the story is simply not realistic. That is just not the way it works.

I am a musician and producer and there are so many really cringe moments in this film. I needed 3 starts until I managed to finish the film. The actors are not that bad. I bet they could play better.

Anyway: I am sad tat this film does not reach its full potential. But at least the songs are good. The writing of the songs is much better. And his performance is great."

A Beautiful Life,"Cringy, but with good music","Be aware of this imdb-score, as it's way to high. This movie feel way too amateurish to that standard we've learned to know Danish movies.

The artist which is here portrayed as a genius, both acts like a baby and seems totally out of anything else what may be as star.

He acts like he is quite stupid, he must have been told to be both akward and inept in his way of communication - so how come he is a genius in lyrics and sing writing?

Well the love story also feels both unlikely and worse of all, quite cringy. It feels like romance pulp fiction litterature. It will be quite impressive if you stand watching the whole movie through. I must admit I didn't, as I felt more and more unwell watching. It probably deserves even worse marks, but the idea is OK, and could've turned out a classic in the right hands."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Yui Aragaki,"As a drama, it covers the basic premise of romance developments, while also discussing more pairs and several topics that pertain to Japanese people. Specifically ""de facto marriage"" relationship (living together but not actually married), same-gender relationships, and other more general subjects. But the core is the main couple, and the evolution of their complicated arrangement.

I actually quite enjoyed it, but mostly because the drama revolves more around the character of ""Mikuri"". A very cute and approachable young lady, with a logical approach to things, while still being emotionally pushy. Certainly a journey to get to know her, and one I'm glad I went through. Aragaki-san is one of my favorite actresses , and is beyond delightful for her to do such a role! Mikuri's side of the family is just as appealing.

Gen Hoshino is definitely a talented singer and does well in his role as the cherry-boy, but his character is far from likeable a lot of the time. But, is this contrast that allowed the character of Mikuri to develop the way it does. Some other characters are well defined, but equally awkward. Still, everyone delivers with ample charisma and help build a world you'd be happy to be a part of.

Series has good production and very energetic segments that contrast well with the seriousness at times. And while not completely predictable, it rarely goes anywhere unexpected. But it keeps a joyful atmosphere and I laughed quite a bit. Would definitely recommend, because it is well written.. and the execution couldn't be better!! There's a movie, for anyone interested.. one that is even more serious still, and deals with the Pandemic and it's problems. As the series itself, all interesting content, educational and a different point of view to consider."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Intriguing,"Presenting various perspectives on the traditional marriage or relationships in a romantic comedy drama. Funny and sometimes moving. Might be a little difficult to understand for non-Japanese cultural people because of the often appearing written Japanese words and parodies (Japanese TV shows and election) . Enjoyable with the good presentation, organization, tempo, humors and very satisfying happy ending."
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Good Enough,"Nigeru wa haji daga, yaku ni tatsu is a comedy with a sweet romance. Actually, I didn't expect to like it that much. But the couple was adorable and cute, although the romance was a bit slow, the conclusion was satisfying. Plus, the side stories were just okay and there to fill the gaps between the pauses from the main story. Fortunately, the drama focused more on the love story of the main characters. In addition, there was a character development for the leading character. Finally, the performances were really good from every actor and actress, and there were some funny moments as well."
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Great series with very talented actors,"I've watched a lot of series, and can tell you this one is awesome!

For the purpose of keeping this review spoiler free, I will only comment on the gems -- what I think made this series as good as it is!

Each one of the actors are sooo good at playing their roles, the plot is interesting and has a great pace, and the scenes look great; action-packed (without any boring pauses or flashbacks), colorful, meaningful, and sweet.

Honestly I could go on and on.. but to summarize I totally recommend this series as both funny and interesting.

Big congratz to the cast, producers, and directors for this amazing series!

Looking forward to seeing more from y'all!"
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,A delightful and light hearted romantic comedy and a must watch in the contract marriage genre,Comentario no disponible
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Cute and Innocent Love Story,"Called ""Full Time Wife Escapist"" on Netflix, this is a cute and definitely innocent love story about a real geeky guy, who is so geeky he would never be able to even want nor find a wife and a girl who has a master's degree but can't find employment other than a housewife that has been contracted for house chores - a scheme she concocted and convinced the geeky guy to take. A cute comedy especially in the beginning when his co-workers at first are suspecting that there is something fishy when he puts his ""wife"" on the work insurance policy but no one has ever met her. They decide to go over to his house because they suspect it is a meta verse wife as he is so geeky there is no way it could be a real woman. They also suspect maybe he is gay. They snoop and find he has a twin bed which only gives them more suspicions. All in all, an innocent romance that is a Japanese drama with a bit of humor."
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Aragaki-san is too cute,"""Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu"", also known as ""The Full-Time Wife Escapist"" or ""We Married as a Job"" is a one of the best josei manga out there, and it was brilliantly adapted into a TV series version some years back.

The casting is simply perfect. The lead, Aragaki Yui, is perfect for the role of Moriyama Mikuri, an over-qualified professional unlucky to be born a woman in modern-day Japan - i.e. No good job or career prospects. She's maybe down, but she's not out.

The supporting characters are equally well-cast. The plot is interesting and entertaining. And the dialogues are generally good. But Aragaki Yui stands out the most for me - she's so cute, sincere, and head-strong as Mikuri that she practically steals every scene.

The story line is so apt for today. Declining birthrates, sexless marriages, too many singles, etc. Then there's the cultural/societal limitations on women with respect to work and career. Add to that the usual marital infidelity, challenges of dating, etc.

Everything hits home with this series."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,A feel good drama,It starts out with the female lead having just finished graduate studies and finding it difficult to land a job. After being let go from a previous employment her father gets her a job cleaning the male leads apartment. When her parents decide to move away she convinces the man to have a contractual marriage so that she can stay there as she did not want to move with her parents. He is very shy and closed off but she manages to get him to open up little by little. He became this way due to his past during his childhood. They eventually have a child and he starts to fall in love with her. She was already in love with him but was ready to give up when he wouldn't open up. Eventually he did. They rode out the pandemic together and in the end he tells her that he wants another child to correct his mistakes from when his first child was born. This is a must watch. At the end of each episode the female lead and the others do their dancing. She's sexy when she dances also the actress that plays her aunt. That was my favorite the ending of each episode. Eventually the male and female lead got married in real life. Now that's a happy ending.
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,"Enjoyable, but...","...no matter how hard the writers try to spin it, imply it, or simply come out and say it, truth is...the dysfunction in this relationship is all one-sided. The writers attempts to make it seem like Mikuri is also to blame is laughable at best.

The male lead (Hira) is clearly on the autistic spectrum, and his ""self-esteem"" issues are not normal upbringing. Now, there is nothing wrong with autism, it is a serious disorder. But to try and sell the series as a ""we both need to improve to make things work"" is truly a flimsy position to take. 100% of the issues in this relationship are of his doing.

And trying to make Mikuri seem like she has character flaws she needs to fix (for instance, having flashbacks where she criticizes herself for chastising a boyfriend for abusing a waitress is pretty low if you ask me, any of us would have smacked him) thus forcing this deep emotional self-review on her part is just filler.

I half wanted them to break up and for her to find someone who appreciated her for more than the 1's and 0's (which by the end, I am still not sure her husband does). Which is funny when you realize the two leads are now married in real life.

SIX stars for Mikuri and Yuri, who carry this show. Zero stars for the Hiramasa scenes, which become so cringingly one-dimensional they stop being funny. Not a good take on mental illness."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Quite heartwarming in the genre,"Writing this, and having watched some other shows in the genre, I feel like this one is not spectacularly better than the best I've seen, but by the end of it I realize I was very invested and entertained - I just had the best time with this show.

Like any other dorama or anime show, the premise starts heavy within the trope-space allotted to these by kami-sama (or so it seems, for many a show to follow this path). Then it's up to you to evaluate whether the build-up for the setting and the main characters are worth your time.

I'm happy to say this one has risen over the top for me. I will not spoil the stuff but let's just this is far from my first rodeo in this genre, whether it is anime or live-action - still this show had me genuinely going all the way. It also features a very interesting but down to live female main character together with a very interesting stricter male character, from which the main energy of the show stems from, and lots of events ensue.

If you are not looking for those over the top once in a lifetime hero-characters, but rather the sweet ""what if?"" in stuff akin to your real life - this is another great show for you. Even the intro and outro are sweet without being over the top performance-wise.

Quite a decent heartwarming show that even manages to bring out some interesting characters and day-to-day concerns in life that ended up being really enjoyable and thoughtful.

Cheers."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Surprisingly Fun to Watch,"Enjoyed this simple, unpretentious (inner joke!) comedy more than I thought I would.

All the actors did a wonderful job - well done, team!

The plot is straightforward and fun. Nothing unexpected would happen here, you know exactly what to expect. A few nice side-stories add variety.

I don't really have any criticism to offer, the show sets the expectations clearly and delivers on them. I loved that it doesn't take itself seriously and has some funny day-dreaming sequences.

The only thing is, it's ""very Japanese"" in terms of actors play style. A bit more exaggerated in intonations and gestures. I don't mind this, but to some audiences this may seem ""artificial.""

It also helps that the clear Japanese they speak helps keep my language skills up! Picked up a few fun phrases from the dialogues for my own use :)"
The Full-Time Wife Escapist,It started as a cute love story...,"...then it became centered on feminism. It was disappointing for several reasons. First, the cute love story stalls. That was the best part of the show. It was beautiful. Have tissues handy. Second, the female lead character suddenly starts having these bizarre over-reactions to things related the the male lead. They are primarily Japanese feminist gripes. The look at Japanese culture is interesting, but her behavior comes out of nowhere. She herself describes her condition as ""muddle-headed"" and can barely understand her reactions herself. There's a secondary character who was already carrying the feminist flag. I wish they would have left the lovers alone. Third, she went from madly in love to disgruntled instantly. Her erratic behavior continues and it's unpleasant. The mood throughout the show becomes darker. I thought maybe she suffered from depression or was bi-polar. She has bizzare daydreams, so I thought mental illness might fit. Nope. You also can't help but feel sorry for the guy, but he's an awkward, isolated, loner who's happy to have any woman in his life at all. It's a shame. There's just enough cute love story residue to carry you through the end of the season. I'd still recommend it I guess, but not strongly."

The Full-Time Wife Escapist,Slow and boring,"I started watching this series cause it didn't have that many episodes and each episode was about 45 minutes, so ideal for a weekend view.

The romantic story looked promising and I'm a sucker for slow, sweet love stories. But was I wrong, it was indeed slow but so slow that it got totally boring. Nothing happened between them, now and then an awkward hug and the two/three kisses shared were even more awkward. Sometimes we got sweet moments but the overall feeling was boredomness. There was no chemistry at all between the ML and FL.

Besides that the last episodes were all about society issues... How society reflect on married couples and how the female lead wanted it to be different in their relationship. Don't get me wrong, I'm all about equality, but somehow I didn't like the pedantic way at all. The bonus episode (second season) felt even worse. The most boring I've ever seen.

The only fact I liked about the series was her aunt, Yuri, in the first season. The way she was as a woman, the way she persuaded her career and how she at last managed to give in to her feelings and fell in love. That all felt more genuine than the whole love story of the main leads.

So, no I don't agree with all the positive notes here."
Call the Midwife,TV at its best,"If you want history at its truth, watch a documentary. As entertainment this show has it all. Every episode has had me in tears from either laughter or poignancy. The casting is perfect and beautifully shot. It really shows the diverse community that has embedded itself in our culture today. Who cares if the docks were not in the right place! The show is about people coming together in tough times and bonding with a community regardless of class and colour. It makes me yearn for that kind of spirit in todays world where everyone has so much and yet is never satisfied. I really hope the BBC invest in a new series - I already miss Miranda!"
Call the Midwife,LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!!,"I have to say I am a bit of a BBC miniseries junkie. So, I am always looking for a new world to jump into. I have to say that ""Call the Midwife"" is one of the best series I have seen. I am enchanted by the young girls and their commitment to caring for their community. And what makes it even more perfect is that they work alongside nuns and can see the world through their eyes. I watch this show over and over again hoping to be dazzled once again (and I always am). I don't know how accurate it is (I have not studied the time), but I do think it is a fantastic commentary on poverty, the role of women, and social class differences. If this were only a drama I wouldn't watch it again and again. But the humor (CHUMMY!!) and the light hearted moments among the business of birth is perfect! Truly, I would love to drop myself into that time and live simply where my only goal was to help women and love people well. You will thoroughly enjoy this show it sisterhood, faith, love, and courage interest you."
Call the Midwife,Faith in humanity,"Whether or not this series' depiction of the East End in the 50's is completely accurate or not seems of little relevance to me. The characters are very likable and the acting, even by the guest actors, is brilliant. However, the main reason I love and wholeheartedly recommend Call the Midwife is because it is so well written, without avoiding the harsh realities of life yet filled with hope and incredible human connection. Miraculously, it manages this without ever becoming cheesy. Every episode leaves me feeling proud to be a human being. I don't think many TV series are able or even try to achieve this and it feels especially important in our times when faith in humanity seems to be in decline."
Call the Midwife,Reminds me,"As I was a student nurse in the East End of London during the mid fifties,(now an ex-pat living in Mexico) this series brings back many memories. I'm glad that some episodes include general nursing and even male patients as well as midwifery. Perhaps doctors were not always as good as the nurses in those days.I even remember an anaesthetist who sat doing his crossword puzzles during operations and no one dared utter a word of reproach.

Now that the East End is suddenly fashionable, even Shoreditch and Brick Lane, what has happened to Wapping where I trained and which used to be so scruffy?

One thing has changed for the better. In those far off days when a woman was admitted with an attempted abortion, euphemistically called ""incomplete abortion"", the police had to be notified and a policewoman would sit by the bed (drinking tea with the night nurse) until the unfortunate patient (who probably already had half a dozen children at least) was well enough to be arrested."
Call the Midwife,"Realistic, modern, seductive and deep, with poignant moral questions.","**UPDATE AFTER SEASON 6: If I could mark 11 stars, that would be it. The episodes about the Thalidomide children were hard but very well focused and treated. I am intrigued at how they film the scenes with just born babies in the very hands of the actors, with wide shots, not just close-ups. Call the Midwife is a most humanistic show indeed, focused on believable, realistic positive values. In a time when humanism seems to be disgraced and devalued everywhere, it is most welcome in my screen.***

This show is extraordinary.

It portrays so vividly the changes of an era in Great Britain, when the latter half of the 20th century blasted into people's daily lives at poor East End London, with all its hopes, marvels, progress, and shifts from a traditional to a modern lifestyle.

The performances are brilliant; the characters are as lovable as well-written; the atmosphere is perfectly recreated, and though quite serious health and social issues are crudely shown along the episodes, the tone is always permeated with hope, love and joy of living.

We do not come from a Christian upbringing, and I am not a Catholic, but I strongly sympathize with the humanistic and sensible approach of Nonnatus House's team of nuns and midwives, where tolerance, acceptance and care for life ranks higher than dogma or empty beliefs.

It is very hard to write a really deep, philosophical and poetic show while maintaining a light-hearted spirit and lots of humour, and Call the Midwife really makes it in a masterly way.

I have to say it gets better and better as the seasons pass, always intertwining the main characters' personal stories and individual cases with relevant and updated issues of public health and bioethics.

By the way, the admirable British public health system, which made wonders in the 50s and 60s and promoted equal access to safety, well-being and human development, also becomes a magnificent political statement in our own age, all the more appreciated in a retrospective look.

There is nothing to complain about of this show, which exerts an honest, compelling, deeply satisfying magnetism on viewers.

For those of us who love motherhood, babies and pregnancies, there is the unique plus of rejoicing at the sight of so many just born babies at the moment of delivery, in a remarkably natural and non-sensationalist feat of cinematography. You can feel the unmistakable miracle of life in each episode, with its sufferings and joys, which is so unusual among a current TV grid full of violence, special effects, overt sex, glorified evil and frenzied action.

Kudos to BBC! Yes, they have made it again, once more!"
Call the Midwife,Hooked! And loving it!,"Obviously I am a man, and will say without any hesitation that we are hooked on this series! My wife and I are best friends and there is nothing more we enjoy than finding a good British series to immerse ourselves together. We have done this for many years, initially finding them in our travels to Britain, and find that British shows seem to ""out weigh"" our American television on many levels.

The subject matter is really unique and absorbing and the acting superb! The complexity of the characters and their interaction, the humor, the secrets, the context, and the weight and undercurrents of its gracious messages have impacted us and continue to do so.

So many times it seems that these British series don't last and are canceled just as we are dedicated to them. It is rewarding to see ""Call the Midwife"" continuing on and we hope it does so for many years to come. We will continue to be fans as long as ""Call the Midwife"" lives!"
Call the Midwife,The milk of human kindness,"It's hard to believe that anyone could be as compassionate and tender as the midwives in Call the Midwife, compassion and tenderness being rare qualities in the increasingly disconnected world of the 21st century. I suspect those qualities are a real incentive for even the casual viewer of this series, which depicts the lives of midwives toiling in the east London of the late 50s- early 1960s. The world of almost 60 years ago was a very different one from today, both from a social and technological standpoint. I'm impressed by the attention to detail in the series, which allows viewers to immerse themselves in the stories, which touch upon issues such as abortion and incest, as well as the then real threats of polio and tuberculosis. More recent stories have even addressed the thalidomide tragedy. The acting is, without exception, top notch, especially that of Judy Parfitt as Sister Monica Joan. I tend to be especially critical of shows that rely on lachrymose sentimentality to further the story. Call the Midwife is at times tender, sweet tempered and, well, nice, but never false as it displays the panorama of the human condition."
Call the Midwife,Wonderful,"I recently found this series on Netflix and instantly fell in love with it. I have never read the books, so I have nothing else to go by. The characters are fabulous. The actors/actresses are amazing. I think every episode has made me both laugh and cry, and I'm looking forward to more!

Some of the episodes can be hard to watch, especially since I am pregnant, and I think that anyone feeling overly anxious about their pregnancy may want to hold off watching this series, because it really shows the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of pregnancy and child birth.

I found one major goof that had me laughing: In one episode they mention knitting blanket squares, and people are shown knitting them. When assembling the squares to make a blanket what they actually have are crocheted granny squares."

Call the Midwife,Veering back towards too much treacle,"You do have to admire this series for surviving for nine seasons now (2020) - and don't get me wrong, I love the fantastic sets, locations, costumes, and little period details. Not to mention the great topics that each episode brings up, related to midwives working in the 1950s and 1960s in the East End of London. The acting is great, although Sister Julienne and Sister Monica Joan, Trixie the nurse and the doctor are possibly the only original characters. In the beginning, the series tried to make births look realistic, with a bit of blood and babies not being born freshly washed. Those scenes are less realistic these days. But lately two things have bothered me. Firstly, the penchant for happy endings. It doesn't matter if there's a woman considering an abortion or a baby born with a birth defect or a disabled boy sent to an orphanage - everything has to turn out rosy in the end. No one has to live with an incurable disease because there's no cure. If someone suffers racism, there are hordes of people to treat them nicely and to strike back. The writers ignore how in the real world, unpleasant things happened to people and sometimes there isn't a happy ending or cure. The other thing I hate is that treacly, apple pie language. The midwives all talk as though they're reading a very crisp British children's book of the 1960s. They don't swear, they always behave impeccably and never do or say anything sly or dishonest. No one is that perfect. I really hate the continuing Vanessa Redgrave voiceover at the start and the end of each episode, too. But this series has been up and down, so my next review might be a better one."
Call the Midwife,"Very enjoyable, if divergent from the book.","I would have scored 10 for this series, except for the fact that it doesn't truly follow the accounts written in the book from which it is taken.

Some of the diversions from the book are to allow the characters other than Jenny Lee to have stronger story lines, which I can accept to an extent. But some of the story lines have been expanded for dramatic effect, so they are not relying upon the original author's memoirs, but rather the imagination of the scriptwriters, which I think is somewhat regrettable.

Having said that I am finding the series entirely watchable, and enjoyable. All the cast seem to be good, but I must say I am most impressed with Miranda Hart as Chummy, what a brick she is."
Call the Midwife,Midwives calling,"Somewhere along the way 'Call the Midwife' has become the nations favourite drama, often toppling Downton in the ratings and earning a reputation as the must watch programme over Christmas.

The reason for its success on paper is simple. It features good actors, good story lines and is gentle viewing on a Sunday night. It's not afraid to tackle big issues, but there's always humour along the way.

The show has had to change over time, losing its main leading lady in Jessica Raine after series three and then dealing with Miranda Hart's decision to scale back her appearances.

The BBC's decision to commission multiple series ahead of time shows how much 'Call the Midwife' has touched the public's heart."
Call the Midwife,I've lost that loving feeling,"I was such a fan in the beginning. Story lines that shed light on post WWII London and it's poverty and need for healing. The characters were interesting. But as the new seasons have unfolded, the writers have failed to replicate the magic of the season before. I miss Chummy, Sister Evangelina, Tom and Barbara and even young Jenny. Running out of stories, perhaps? And now, their attempts to film under Covid-19 restrictions are resulting in lack of chemistry among cast members, underdeveloped stories, and an odd draggy pace to the dialogue. Has this series run it's course? Possibly. Maybe it's time for the final curtain."
Call the Midwife,What Was Once an Amazing Show Dives into PC,"I seriously thought this was one of the, if not THE, most beautifully written shows I've ever watched, and cried after every episode -- until about Season 7. After that, it's become more and more disappointing, and a very different show at times. Over the top Sister Monica Joan monologues, and constant, extremely gratuitous storylines designed to be in line with modern PC have now made this show seem so forced and fake. I used to relish getting lost in the episode, in the time period, but now, it seems that they're so interested in teaching us a lesson and making it so PC, that the stories get lost. Instead of marveling at the beauty of it anymore, I'm fast forwarding through a lot of it. Halfway through S8, and I'm not sure I'm interested in going any further."

Call the Midwife,Heartwarming and Necessary,"This is one of the most beautiful shows I've ever watched. The writing and acting are both superb, and the incredible stories take us on a journey to show us the true meaning LOVE. Do people with this much compassion actually exist? They do, and Call the Midwife reminds us of that.

This show epitomizes acceptance, patience, and perspective. It's the unconditional love and nonjudgemental views of the characters that make your heart swell while you watch.

I'm rewatching and this time with my 13 year old daughter. I recommend the show to all my friends and get excited when they tell me they've started."
Call the Midwife,A Hidden Jewel,"This is one of the best shows on tv. I discovered it two years ago while watching a Masterpiece presentation. Haven't missed an episode since. I prefer shows like The Americans, The Walking Dead, Fargo, etc. but this one struck a chord somewhere in the depths of my psyche and I instantly liked the stories, the scenery of 1960's London and all of the characters. This is television at its best.

An update, my favorite tv night is watching Call the Midwife and Billions back to back. That pretty much covers humanity from A to Z. Writers on both shows deserve A+'s and the actors do too. Keep 'em coming and I'll keep watching."
Call the Midwife,BEST PROGRAM ON TELEVISION - YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED,"Call the Midwife is an awesome series, and probably the best currently on television. The story lines are excellent and seems to be, for the most part, historically correct and accurate.

This series is based on the best-selling memoirs, Call the Midwife, by Jennifer Worth, who died six months before the first episode aired. The series depicts, in part, and has been expanded upon, her work as a district nurse and midwife in the East End of London during the 1950's and 1960's. Obviously, story lines needed to be expanded to create a long-running series such as this, but that does not hinder the enjoyment of the program, and in fact, probably adds to it, as it allows for development of new and existing characters.

Every single cast member is believable. The acting of everyone is phenomenal and realistic. The writers have done an exceptional job with the scripts. The sets seem to be relatively accurate for the time period. You couldn't ask for a better more realistic series.

While some reviewers have complained that this strays away a little from the memoirs, I can't see that anyone could expect a long running series not do so. When Jennifer Worth was writing her memoirs, she was writing them as a memoir and not in preparation for a long running television probgram. For this to have worked for television, , more needed to be added, and the script writers have done it in an exceptional way."
Call the Midwife,First Few Seasons Were Great,"The first three seasons, based on the books by. Jennifer Worth, were among my favorites of all time. It had sentiment but not sentimentality, and dealt with the real problems of people in the East End of London and the women who provided them the service they needed. A lot of the cast changed over the years, but generally kept up the quality, and some characters who were rather stereotypical in the first couple years were allowed to mature, but the show continued to deal with real problems, such as, birth control, the strengths and weaknesses of the National Health service, the effect of certain drugs on pregnancy, etc. The Christmas shows are particularly wonderful. The past couple of years, however, have started to get away from the original idea of dealing with health and societal issues into more of a soap opera. Season 13 was a disappointment, and hope the writers either get back to the issue oriented approach or recognize it is time to wrap it up."
Call the Midwife,This Arkansas cowboy absolutely loves this show,I've been a bbc fan since I first watched Monty Python in Dallas where it 1st aired in the early 70s. Call the Midwife is so well done. The cinematography and the acting especially is superbly done. I forget I'm watching a show and am brought to tears every episode. I can't wait to watch it all again but with my wife this time.
Call the Midwife,I remember London in 1957,"I was a schoolchild in London in 1957, so I watched this programme expecting to see the London I remember recreated. I had to go to school on the tube and underground. I was from north London, but quite a few of my school friends came from East London. When I went to tea with them after school, their homes were clean and perfectly respectable. One thing I do remember though, was the warehouses and the docks were strictly out of bounds, although we could, and did, play on the bomb sites. I still have friends who were brought up in East London in the 1950s. I think this series is based on the exceptional cases rather than the normal ones. Certainly there were homes in the area, which had survived the bombing and had outside toilets and tin baths. In my experience, my friends' Mums kept their flats immaculately clean inside. The, houses, warehouses and the dock walls were all blackened with soot from the railways. 1957 was before the clean air act and fogs and smogs were common. It was good to see people getting about by bicycle, cars were few in the 1950s and mostly black saloons. I don't remember meeting or seeing any exceptionally large families. All the friends and family I had and now have, who were born and brought up in east London, are either only children, or have one or two siblings. I will watch the rest of the series with interest."
Call the Midwife,"As good as anything in many, many years on Masterpiece","My wife and I have been regular viewers of PBS' various British dramas for more than 40 years. I believe that ""Call the Midwife"" stands with anything that PBS has shown in that time. The cast is outstanding, and is aided by terrific writing. The producers and writers have done a very good job of pulling stories from the books, and presenting an element of 20th Century London history that most American viewers knew nothing about. There is a wonderful blend of humor, sadness, and an overall sense of time and place that is rarely achieved in TV dramas. I have particularly liked the sensitive portrayal of the sisters throughout the series, since (believe it or not) my mother had studied to become a nun. They are consistently shown as a complete person, not characterized as stiff and robotic people. If you haven't read the books the series is based upon, try them. You will see how faithfully the producers have followed them. A wonderful series!"

Call the Midwife,About season 8 mostly,"In the early seasons I loved this show so much. Couldn't get enough. The characters felt like real people, the storylines were engaging and I was fully invested, tears and all. However, after season 7, the show changed. Almost imperceptibly at first but by the end of season 8 it was really noticeable. The babies started feeling more like props rather than an important part of the show. The characters no longer felt like real people, more like plot devices to explain the message of the episode. It all started to feel very ""preachy"", and I don't mean in a religious sense. It felt like modern sensibilities being projected onto someone's perception of the 60s, which just felt off. I watched until the end of season 8 but I won't be watching further. It doesn't feel like the same show anymore. Maybe the later seasons are fine, who knows?"
Call the Midwife,The Best Series Since Downton,Comentario no disponible
Grace and Frankie,Fonda and Tomlin hit it out of the park,"I binged the series over a 2-day period and wished there was more. The characters were well developed and the whole thing was very entertaining. It covered many bases that divorce can bring about to family and friends, and dealt with issues of loss, honesty and aging, among others.

I wish Sheen and Waterston had had greater chemistry between them, but their interactions with the family members were believable and poignant. I especially enjoyed June Diane Raphael and Baron Vaughn, as two of the four adult children.

What I can't decide is who I liked better, Fonda or Tomlin. In each case, they braved characterizations that were vulnerable and multi-faceted. In the case of each, this is their best performance, and the two together were phenomenal. Funny one moment and heart-tugging the next.

This is an adult story, in the best sense of the word."
Grace and Frankie,Fonda & Tomlin Are Magic Together,"I will always love Lily Tomlin. I always enjoyed Jane Fonda in her youthful movie star mode, but since she came out of retirement, she elevates everything she's in. I think she was the primary reason I kept watching Newsroom for three seasons. I kept waiting for her every appearance. In Grace and Frankie, Tomlin and Fonda have to overcome a rather unbelievable situation--that is to face the fact that they husbands they have been married to for over forty years have somehow falling in love and intend to marry each other. Relegated to a kind of ""Odd Couple"" status, they end up living in a Malibu beach house their husbands bought years earlier. Each couple used the house on separate weekends. Now Grace and Frankie have to pick up the shattered pieces of their lives and move on. Jane Fonda as Grace is at her brittle comedic best. She delivers in spades, looks stunning in her latish 70s and plays off Lily Tomlin's hippy-esque character with spunk and funny nerve. Grace has to face the fact that she's an uptight, judgmental pain in the ass. And Tomlin's Frankie is just the person to remind her over and over again. The scripts are tightly funny. The interplay between the two ex-couples is expert. Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen have nearly thankless roles as the two spouses who dump their wives, but they handle the dialog ad the romantic banter with dignity. But let's face it, you're waiting for Grace and Frankie to spark off each other. It's not the kind of laugh-out-loud absurdest insults The Golden Girls hurled at each other with such glee, but the humor is key here. There is is just enough drama to remind us of the absurdity of life. I couldn't wait to watch this show when it was announced. Fonda and Tomlin were terrific with Dolly Parton in Nine to Five, but they are even better here. This is a terrific show. I'll stick around as long as these two glorious stars are here to make us laugh and cry."
Grace and Frankie,I Love This Show!,"I will admit the first episode is kind of ""meh."" I wasn't thrilled. I mean this was Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda! It should have been rolling funny.

It wasn't. And the second episode? Well...

But then!! OMGosh!

By the third episode the writers and cast and crew had found their stride and I was in love. So clever! So funny! So sweet! So engaging! Yes, that is a lot of explanation points but I couldn't help it. The show deserves them all.

Lily is simply wonderful as Frankie. I mean I fell in love with her. I want her as my BFF. Fonda was wonderful as well as the uptight Grace. She could have played it as a cliché but I was happy to find myself slowly warming up her as the episodes passed. In other words, Fonda showed up the person beneath the outer shell.

I liked Sheen but was crazy about Waterston playing the men who leave their wives to be with each other.

I wasn't crazy about some of the kids, but that wasn't the actor's faults. They did great. I just didn't find them very likable people. But again that was all right.

For instance is Brooklyn Decker cold as Mallory--but she was a chip off her old mother (Fonda). And Fonda's other daughter, June Diane Raphael as Brianna, is a bit of a bit*h. But again, she was a product of a mother who was never there and very self involved.

I did however love Ethan Embry as Coyote (one of Tomlin's adopted kids). He is a recovering addict of all kinds and my heart went out to him. The only member of the cast that I was cold to was Baron Vaughn as Nwabudike (the other adopted son). I don't want to be mean but he was terrible. He approached his character as if this show were a 70s sitcom and not a Netflix dramedy--his acting over the top. He jolted me out of the story every time.

I really hope this show comes back for a second season. I loved it!"
Grace and Frankie,Superb - A brilliant series full of talent,"This is a brilliant and timely series. Sheen, Waterston, Fonda, and Tomlin. I'd guess nearly 200 years of combined acting experience. It shows. The writing in this series is witty and attentive to popular culture. It gently picks away at the nonsense in our contemporary lives and exposes the raw human condition. The only thing that eats at me a little is the upper-class white privilege that penetrates throughout. Despite this, the series makes some very real, critical, and timely social commentary. At the very moment that the Supreme Court of the United States debates gay marriage, we have Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston - two very straight and very accomplished actors - kissing on the screen.

Having met Jane Fonda, Lilly Tomlin, and Martin Sheen, I can tell you that these actors care deeply about their work and the role it plays in advancing social justice.

Sadly, many will critique this show along political lines - whether they support equal rights or not. Watch it for yourself, it's good TV."
Grace and Frankie,Simply Charming,"Though I see where one may feel it's dull or ""Flat"" as one reviewer called it. It's because this show has a sense of honesty and a realistic charm to make you forget its a show and not something happening to a friend. When something seems real it loses a bit of edge, real isn't sexy (girls wearing black thongs every night sexy/not real, ugly laundry or period panties so not sexy/ oh so real).This gem of a show has Tomlin, Fonda, Sheen and Waterson, Living Legends and they prove it in each scene. The history their characters have in some part feels more authentic do to the history the cast must actually have. Years working in the same industry, on a number of projects together (West Wing, Newsroom, 9 to 5, to name a few). The added connections brought by their children brilliantly played by Raphael, Vaughn, Decker and especially Ethan Embry legitimizes the story because no matter what we do it always effects our kids even if they're grown. The revolving door of great guest stars is that perfect little finishing touch to an already great freshman year. I cant wait for more , it does not help that I too binge watched in one sitting just created a longer wait for my self."
Grace and Frankie,Best show ever!!,"I love Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. I hope this show never ends. I just hate that Netflix releases whole seasons in one day. I already finished season 5, and now I don't know what to do with my life."
Grace and Frankie,"Up there with Friends, Northern Exposure,....","Grace and Frankie is a heartfelt comedy excellently portrayed by four veteran actors. This original comedy takes you into the lives of two couples and their families as they work through a major change in family dynamics. You'll find yourself wanting to learn more about the four main characters and how they adapt to their ensuing life changes. You'll find yourself empathizing with Grace and Frankie as they each reconcile with the end of their 40 year marriages. New opportunities for personal growth and understanding of different lifestyles create a platform for growth and understanding between all four characters. I watched all 13 episodes in 3 days and I did indeed laugh out-loud! Hats off to NetFlix for delivering a much needed adult comedy. Thank you to Lily, Jane, Sam and Martin for breathing the life into these characters."
Grace and Frankie,"Clever, Funny & Endearing","Getting divorced at the age of 70? Leaving your wife for a man at the age of 70? In the past, people with more than 20 years of marriage just stuck together. Maybe they were not in love anymore, maybe there was only respect and companion, but a new start at the age of 70 was never a chance. Grace & Frankie makes the opposite happen in a such a real way. Because they are 70 years old people, but they live in 2015. They have cellphones, computers, they masturbate, they have sex, they get high, they feel lonely, they cry, they laugh (and make us laugh) about what happens when you are 70 and don't spend your days in a rocking chair.

I'm only 28 years old and find this show so refreshing. A reminder that getting older does not prevent you from doing stupid things, making mistakes and/or hurting people you love. Because getting older never means you stop failing at life, but you can always take it in a humorous way.

*Note* This review was written after finishing Season 1. I hope it continues this good."
Grace and Frankie,Is there anything not to love about Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin?,"Decades after they played co-workers in ""9 to 5"", Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are back together as friends who have to start cohabiting after their husbands (Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) come out as gay. Sure enough, their personalities bounce off each other.

The show has lots in store, and in the process reminds us that Jane and Lily still got it. Definitely watch this series."

Grace and Frankie,Great at the beginning but..,"As the seasons went on, the show really gets worse and worse. Frankie starts acting as if she has brain damage and family drama is over the top.. It is sad because show was really fun at the beginning.."
Grace and Frankie,Laughter & tears,"Grace & Frankie from enemy's to best friends. The duo goes through life & death together. Frankie is comical, witty, the fun one & Grace is the witty, uptight, business woman. Both come together at odds ends like a Ying & yang.

I loved this show. The 7th season finale was happy but sad. I will miss this show. I'm glad the ending was well written.

Two people who couldn't live without each other. Together they brought out good & bad of each other.

Frankie the positive person always shining & Grace was the negative person. Together they became the best of each other. No matter the problems either one had they both lifted each other up.

Both loved their families."
Grace and Frankie,Is Season 5 a bit of a disappointment?,"I have watched every episode of seasons 1 to 4 and absolutely glued to the screen. I'm not feeling it so much in season 5. Do others feel the same way? To me, it feels like it's lost something between season 4 and 5. I noticed a lot more swearing too. It's not an issue but much more noticeable in this season. It's still charming and fun but I'm not glued to the screen like the other seasons."
Grace and Frankie,Loved the first couple seasons....then,Got really tired of Frankie. She's not even a believable character anymore. Who the heck would put up with her. Charming and fun for a while but has become too slapstick and just plain dumb.
Grace and Frankie,Steep decline,"I started out absolutely loving this show, now I am part way through the 5th season and I find myself hating Frankie.. no longer fun and quirky, just unbearably irrational

Brianna is the best part of the show."
Grace and Frankie,Funny and Charming,"I've watched this series a few times...it ranks up there with ""Frasier"" as one of the series I can rewatch and enjoy. The leads are excellent...no surprise there. Secondary characters add so much to the story and are so funny (guest stars and those who were in a few episodes). As an older woman, I can relate to many of the story lines...of course...they are exaggerated for effect - but make me laugh out loud. It doesn't hurt that they live in a beautiful home at the beach (I really like the second home for Sal and Robert...gorgeous set). I was sorry to see the series end but look forward to the upcoming movies with Fonda and Tomlin."
Grace and Frankie,THIS IS WHAT SUPERB LOOKS LIKE!,"Take four veteran incredible equally talented actors - Sam Waterston, Martin Sheen, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda and give them scripts that offer opportunities to 'be' deeply honest as they explore their new lives and relationships in a way that is rare in a sitcom. After one dinner announcement changes all of their lives in a most unexpected way. The balance between pain and humour is perfect. Now add the 4 adult children each with their own personalities and you see how they too navigate relationships. Fonda and Tomlin are pure magical gold. Waterston and Martin bring such an honesty to their relationship. They too are gold!! I'm on my third round watching this series and still laugh out loud and feel all the feels!!"
Grace and Frankie,"Worth watching, great cast that didn't disappoint.","I was pleasantly surprised by Grace and Frankie. So often lately I have been disappointed in spite of a stellar cast. In this case the cast lived up to their reputations and I have to commend Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen for their performances. Another reviewer who stated ""The thing about dramedies is that you want them to both be funny and dramatically compelling (i.e. Transparent). Grace and Frankie wasn't especially funny. And the trite hippie/uptight odd couple theme undercuts the drama; how sorry can you feel for clichés?"" I'm not sure if he actually watched more than the 1st episode and if he didn't he missed the best part as it did start off a bit slow but Grace and Frankie is compelling with several interesting stories to tell with humor thrown in where it was needed. I felt like I was peeking in on 2 real families as they dealt with life changing events. I liked this so much more than Transparent which I thought was one huge cliché. The writing here was so much better and didn't rely on continual shock value, excessive foul language, and gratuitous nudity to get the story told or to hold the viewers interest. The solid script and performances did that in Grace and Frankie."

Grace and Frankie,Very often like a cozy blanket.,"This TV series is, in my honest opinion, funny, witty, enjoyable, well written and quite relatable. It also has emotional depth, great acting and some unexpected moments. I have watched a couple of scenes many times, for example the first ones.

""Grace and Frankie"" is very often like a cozy blanket. You can, metaphorically speaking, wrap it around you and just join Graces and Frankies journey.

Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin have great friendship chemistry in this TV series. It was interesting to follow the sensible Grace and the quirky Frankie. They balanced each other in a nice way.

I´m going to genuinely miss this TV series. I highly recommend it to everyone!"
Grace and Frankie,"Classy, Funny & Actors R at the top of their Games!","This show was the best written and best cast show I have seen in a long long time! From start to finish its hilariously funny, great story lines and the actors r superb! Jane Fonda & Lily Tomlin are still at the top of their game. The grown kids they cast as their children were perfectly cast. I love them all. One minute I am laughing so hard I have tears and the next I am being deeply moved by their issues and how close they are as family & friends. If you don't watch this u will be missing out on one of the few gems in tv history! From front to back it is a masterpiece of art. Love love love this show and the cast. I could watch it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and tune in to this masterpiece. Masterfully written & performed. If I could rate it higher than a 10 I would. BEST SHOW ON TV RIGHT NOW! Dont miss it!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW. I enjoyed every minute of it. I am sad it is ending."
Grace and Frankie,Uneven but overall entertaining,"For the most part, I have been enjoying this series. I'm as far as the middle of Season Three, and beginning to find some of it hard going. There always seems to be some big issue that no one is talking about, and there are misunderstandings etc. It's frustrating.

I find Frankie highly annoying especially, with her fruitcake hippy- dippy ways, and holier-than-thou attitude about just about everything. She is spoiled and difficult and a giant pain in the you know what. Just clean up after yourself Frankie, and get over yourself while you're at it!

Grace is far more relate-able as far as I'm concerned, and Fonda plays the role very well; also she is in amazing physical condition, and while I assume she has had cosmetic surgery of some sort, it is extremely well done, and she still looks like herself. Can't believe she's in her mid-seventies; all that exercise in the 80s has served her well.

As far as I'm concerned, the standout among the veteran actors is Martin Sheen who shows an aptitude for a light comic touch - I would like to see more of him, and more humorous situations for him to react to. His partner Sol, played by Sam Waterston, is a lovely man, but I find him to be awkward to the extent that I can't really believe the romance between him and Robert. He is too much of a caricature; too much mugging and general mannerisms, tics and whatnot. I love the actor, but would like to see him toned down and more human, more believable.

All other supporting actors playing the adult children of the four main characters are wonderful,and a joy to watch. They are interesting and likable characters in their own right. I also enjoyed seeing the guest actors who come and go, Swoozie Kurtz, Marsha Mason, Sam Elliot, Craig T. Nelson, Mary Kay Place, Michael Gross etc. It's nice to see these professionals still in action.

One of my biggest beefs, and this is going to sound silly, but it really bothers me is this: There are many scenes where elaborate meals are prepared for various events, tables are laden with wonderful looking food which is set out for guests and then...someone says something, something happens, whatever - and suddenly the food is forgotten. No one eats! The food is just left there. Oooooh I hate that! Either have actors deal with the scene while eating, or don't have all that food sitting around. Just stop it!"

Grace and Frankie,"Fonda, Tomlin, Sheen and Raphael carries a poorly written show","Fonda, Tomlin, Sheen and Raphael makes the show. The rest of the cast seems to be, season after season, tied down to horrible writing and pointless sidestories.

Different story for Sam Waterson (Sol). Waterson needs to stay AWAY from the genre. The overacting is so profound, that you can't enjoy any of his scenes. He is simply over the top every single time.

The entire supportive cast gets screwed by horrible writing. There is just no reason to feel anything for any of the kids (Decker, Embry, Raphael, Vaugn) I don't doubt their abilities, and Raphael is wonderful, but you cannot help but be annoyed by the stupidity of Coyote, the unlikable nature of bud, and the very very bland writing for Mallory.

Sheen stands out in his role as Robert. He is simply great throughout the series.

Watch this show if you are a fan of Fonda and Tomlin. Do not watch the show if you want quality writing and characters with any depth.

6/10 (thanks to Sheen)"

Inuyasha,Shining anime,"Kagome, a modern girl from Tokyo, accidentally finds a portal which leads her to the medieval Japan where she meets the half-demon Inuyasha. She decides to help him find a magic crystal and fight the evil demon Naraku...

""Inuyasha"" is an anime I was 95 % sure it wouldn't work, but it did. With it's virtuous mix of romance, comedy, action, adventure, fantasy and horror (causing some of it's episodes to be censored in some countries) this is simply a great show that sucked me in. Although it's too long (the only major flaw, since the 160 episodes watered down the story) and has some weak episodes, ""Inuyasha"" is nothing short of brilliant, and it seems it's characters will never become boring: from Miroku, who is always touching woman's butts and asking them if they will have a baby with him up to Kagome who is trying to maintain her good grades in school while fighting in medieval Japan. This is what ""Dragonball"" should have been, but wasn't. Also, some sequences stand out:

1) Sesshomaru, the bad guy, was exhausted in the woods. Rin, a little orphan girl, saw him and wanted to help him. She went to her village to get him some food but the cruel villager's beat her up. She still managed to get Sesshmoaru some food but he declined. Yet he asked her where she got those bruises and she was happy he noticed her effort. Later on Rin was killed in the forest and Sesshomaru accidentally found her dead body. After a little thinking he took his magic sword and, despite being evil, brought her back to life. From there on, they had a mutual bond.

2) In the episode with those demon bats who terrorized a village a young mother gave birth to a half-demon bat girl, Shiori. Shiori was molested by ""normal"", human kids, who kicked her. Before she entered her house she wiped away her tears and pretended to be happy so that her mother wouldn't notice she couldn't fit in.

3) When Kagome finds out Inuyasha is alive she runs towards him, passing by Kouga, all the while her tears are falling on his sad face.

These situations stand out because they look as if taken from real life. I know I will never forget at least those three precious moments mentioned above. After these very emotional and powerful scenes one might ask yourself if the ""Inuyasha"" authors are not making this for commercial sake but for real, for a deeper statement and inter sociological and racial messages.

Grade: 9/10"
Inuyasha,Inuyasha- A Classic Rommance Action Anime For All Ages,"This Anime Inuyasha,While I was watching in my school days prime time on Animax (now aniplex) Used to think that was gory and has some badass fighting moments with big demon bosses with lots of forest fires and destruction.With inuyasha carrying a heavy sword every one will think like that.Now after 12 years or more i guess watched whole series felt the nostalgia from the start. I know that there are haters on internet saying dragging story line unwanted fillers etc., but what u have to see is the main theme of the anime is to draw out the nostalgia for fans of all ages.It does have regular fashion shonen anime villains for each episodes and battles will end with in that episode or some takes two episodes.The more the episodes pass the greater u involve to enjoy. Coming towards the characters inuyasha may be rough and funny he is not just a fighter for something there is a reason for him to fight unlike naruto or bleach no trash involvement with villain sentiments its all the way romance and protection.. Kagume and inuyasha story drags with same to villain naraku anyway it deepens lately. Coming to my favorite romance in this anime is between miroku and sanji these are the moments that really refresh the characters and fun to watch.Seshomoru is coolest character.Shippo is very fun with gadgets and bravery stuff.Kagou a wolf character reminds me twilight saga. My suggestion is there are plenty of lot of anime and there are people who are reluctant to enjoy this classic Inuyasha has to offer they just partaway in the middle of anime.There are short animes like deathnote,full metal alchemist etc., fast paced and logical which inuyasha haters compare to them.I suggest this is a kind of anime requires hope of enjoyment to rejoice the environment inside the anime that it offers.So there are people who like naruto even though it has a lot more fillers than this,keep the fillers aside.Keep in mind that fillers are there in inuyasha only to imagine the environment.If u feel the fighting with demons are repetitive to watch u can seek them and watch.The true aim of this anime is enticement,romance,action & true feel of each episode with peace."

Inuyasha,Pretty Darn Cool,"With Pokemon, Beyblade and Yu-Gi-Oh gracing the small screen, it has become difficult to take Japanese Anime seriously. Thankfully, Cartoon Network has put a block of Japan's finest in their red-eye time slot, spearheaded by Inuyasha.

The general gist of the plot is Kagome, a modern schoolgirl, winds up in feudal times and must help a half-demon(Inyasha) recover the shards of a jewel of ultimate power.

One might say that Inuyasha combines the best of both Shonen and Shojo stylings. The world of feudal Japan is laced with ghosts, demons and other critters who roar, slash, dash, slice, splat and snarl, and at least one of these beasts duke it out with the title character per episode. On the other hand, there is romance, guilt, past betrayals and secrets to be discovered, not to mention sight gags and running jokes.

The visual quality is a step above pocket monsters and moon princesses as well. The show is thankfully devoid of giant sweat-drops, fountain tears and misplaced mouths.

It takes patience to watch the series, with 100+ episodes and long-running character development, it would take a fortune of DVD purchases or steadfast loyalty to the television at 1:00 am (as of this writing)to get the entire story down.

But even so, I highly recommend this show to anybody yearning for more than just flaming mesomorphs and pocket monsters."
Inuyasha,One of my favorite Animes,"I love Inu Yasha, it has to be one of my favorite animes, it's one of the shows that got me into anime in the first place. And I adore Rumiko Takahashi, heh. But Inu Yasha is an anime with just the right mix in it. Both girls and guys can like it, it isn't leaned towards one gender, it's has just the right mix of action, comedy, and romance. It's just great!

Anyway, here's a summary. A girl named Kagome is pulled down her family's well and she ends up in feudal times Japan in the same location that she lives in modern-day Tokyo, except of course it's feudal times. In feudal times she meets a half dog demon, Inu Yasha. She finds this magic jewel, but ends up shattering it into hundreds of tiny jewel shards. So that's one of the main points of the show, the quest for the sacred jewel shards which are extremely powerful. Some of the other characters include: Miroku, a kind but somewhat perverted young monk(my favorite character, that's why I put him first ^_^); Sango, a butt-kicking girl whose village was destroyed by the evil demon Naraku; Shippou, a cute little fox demon with the ability to shape-shift; Kikyo, a whacked out priestess (seriously, she has major problems) of whom they think Kagome is the reincarnation of; Sesshomaru, Inu Yasha's evil demon brother who happens to be quite good looking; Naraku who is an evil demon person who's out to get the sacred jewel shards; and there are tons of other people too, who either aren't as important, or just show up a few times. Now, if you've never seen this anime (who hasn't seen it?) I suggest that you do."
Inuyasha,The Best Anime deserves an Oscar,Comentario no disponible
Inuyasha,kick ass,"InuYasha is the single most awesome anime TV show and TV show period. I love watching it. i know so many people who love it as well! I cant wait 2 buy the seasons on DVD! The movies were very good as well. I only got 2 watch the third one, but it was still really good!I really want everything i can find that is about InuYasha: movies, season DVD sets, toys, collectibles, and anything else i can find that's about InuYasha.I want 2 see the other movies really bad. i herd that the 2nd 1 was the best, but according, 2 IMDb's reviews, the third one was the best. I also really hope that they keep making InuYasha movies as well.."
Inuyasha,Genius of Rumiko Takahashi,"Considering that this is a weekly anime series that's under strict budget and time schedule, I think this series easily bests the best works of Disney studios.

Even as an anime that came from the land of anime - Japan, this series is exemplary in its story, and quality.

Japan has many quality anime series and movies. Likes of Hayao Miyazaki's anime have even won Academy Awards. Maybe western audiences who are not familiar with anime might be impressed with the quality of Studio Ghibri's movies, but they don't see that this series is superior in every way, except for the money and the man power that went into production compared to Miyazaki's works.

Unlike Miyazaki's anime characters, Inuyasha's characters have fully developed character. Miyazaki's characters all look the part, but that's where it stops. None of them really have anything inside. His story also progresses in an expected manner, but Inuyasha's story has unexpected turn at every step of the way.

Academy Awards committee must be blind for not being able to see the real difference. If you are going to choose the best from Japan, Rumiko Takahashi's work really deserves the prize.

Every character in this series is beautifully designed. And each one has charm of their own. What's funny is that all of them have certain character flaws that adds to the humor of the story.

One person came up with all this ? This is unbelievable. But Rumiko Takahashi seemed to have done it. She's designed the characters, put life into them, and came up with the most interesting story you can lay your eyes on.

This is truly the work of a genius. When she first brought her ""Manga"" into the publisher, I've heard that the editor proclaimed ""This is a talent that appears once only in 20 years."". Well, 20 years have already passed, and we're still waiting for another talent like her to appear.

The word ""Greatest"" must be reserved for something like this. This is a classy, funny, beautiful entertainment that is at the pinnacle of artistry."
Inuyasha,"was good at first, but gets old.","The title basically says what I have to say. The first anime I ever saw, introduced to me in second grade. I loved Kirara, I even still have the stuffed anime I bought in 4th grade. I loved the characters, Sango, Kirara, Miroku, Shippo, Seshoumaru, Rin, Kikyo, etc...basically everyone. Except Kagome, of course(I tend to not like the main characters in things a lot). The animation is OK, but after middle school I realized that I was learning to draw better. The story line was good until they started adding all these extra characters and stuff just to make an impressive amount of episodes. When they finally finished season 1 at over 100 episodes they made another season, and I just lost my taste for it. Inuyasha really needs to get to the point and come to an end. Also, the story's too predictable. Over all, Inuyasha is not the greatest."
Inuyasha,One of the best written anime,"Inuyasha is an anime with a non stop emotions, drama and tragic. the anime has some of the best written plot and characters I've seen, every character felt real like I could connect to them. The world building and explorring of yokais is top tier. thank you Rumiko for this"
Inuyasha,All in all,"All in all, I really adore Inuyasha. The mangaka Rumiko Takahashi assists with the illustrations, so even while the artwork is excellent, there are instances in the movies where it falters.

Although the plot is straightforward and simple to follow, it does seem to go on forever, so if you can sit through a long anime, this might be for you.

Each of the brilliantly developed characters has a running joke of their own. With the exception of Kagome, every character has a troubled and sometimes tragic past that frequently involves the loss of a loved one. Miroku is by far my favorite. He is a womanizing, perverse monk who makes out with almost any girl. Some characters, like the cute fox demon Shippo, on the other hand, only have a small part and very few or no fight sequences. However, that only makes up a tiny portion of his gags.

There is a lot of blood in some of the good conflicts. But the fights are brief, and it feels like Inuyasha does the majority of the work all the time. (As he has said on a few occasions). The others appear to be recovering and employ the same techniques. Sango, a demon slayer, for instance, utilizes her Hirakotsu, a massive boomerang that she frequently uses to beat Miroku when he makes advances toward other girls or touches her butt, but she also carries a sword that she hardly ever uses. I believe I've only seen it three times, and the only time I can recall it is right before she is going to use it on Kohaku, her younger brother, who is under the main evil guy's influence and doesn't remember slaughtering their entire town.

Throughout the entire series, the romance is my favorite aspect. It's not as romantic as it is sweet. However, it's the kind that fills you with warmth on the inside. Regretfully, the romance doesn't really get much better. (Excluding Sango and Miroku). Additionally, a massive love net exists. However, as I mentioned, there are a lot of sweet spots. (Well, I know that Inuyasha's brother Sesshomaru is a fave for all of you fangirls. Yes, I'm not a snob.)

Overall, I think Inuyasha is a good anime-my personal favorite. If you're patient and enjoy a good laugh, watch it. It features bloody fight scenes and charming romance moments typical of an anime."
Inuyasha,Stunning,"Mix fairy-tale with fantasy, legend with reality. This is a dark fairy-tale, beautiful and compelling right from the explosive start.

Inu Yasha, a creature that is half man, half dog-demon, attempts to steal an enchanted jewel from a shrine, to change himself into a full-blooded demon. However, the priestess sworn to protect the jewel fires an arrow into his heart, and nails him to a tree. The priestess dies from her wounds, and Inu Yasha falls into an enchanted sleep. 50 years later, the soul of the priestess returns to the forest, reborn in the body of Kagome, a girl from modern-day Tokyo who has fallen through time into the era of myth and legend. Inside her, the jewel has been reborn along with the soul of the priestess. Her precense awaken the dog-demon from his long imprisonment, and along with him awaken his long-alseep desires for the jewel. However, by the power of Kagome's arrow, the jewel is broken and its shards scattered across the lands. Each shard holds the power to make evil hearts stronger, and bestow misery upon the land. Kagome and Inu Yasha reluctantly set out together, to collect the shards and make the jewel complete again. ""Inu Yasha"" is the story of that journey.

What captured me about this series was Inu Yasha himself. His character is dark, evil, and mean, plus he behaves an animal. The makers have really managed to capture his animal side, and this (along with great, charismatic voice-acting), gives him a precense seldom seen in animated shows. In the beginning, he is betrayed, hostile and alone, but as the show moves on, he developes greatly, by slowly but surely warming up and gaining kindness in his demonic eyes. The reason for this is Kagome, a brave heroine that far exceeds your standard shrieky-maiden-anime-chick.

There is some humor to this show too. It's nicely done, it doesn't steal time from the story, and it fits where it is placed. But don't expect this to be some light comedy-show like Ranma: Inu Yasha is a deep and dark fairy tale that deals seriously with questions like the want for strenght, the want for life, the want for revenge, and the slim line between love and hatred. All within one huge story-arc with many meaningful subplots.

As for the enemies, they not only display great strenght and cruelty, but some of them are also allowed to develope as characters, which is extremely rare for bad-guys. The action is very cool, skillfully done and overall fantastic. Inu Yasha, the one who does most the fighting, fights to kill and doesn't hold back. A lot of blood and some really nasty scenes in some episodes.

The animation is magnificent, as well as the soundtrack. I have only seen the subbed version, but I can highly recommend it about any dub. There is no way any translation could outdo the original cast.

This is the best anime I have EVER seen. It's original and powerful with a lot of depth, in a world where fairy-tale has merged with fantasy. Plus, Inu Yasha's dog-ears are super-kawaii... ^_^

Don't miss it!

Inuyasha,Clever and original series that unfortunately has little to offer,Comentario no disponible
Inuyasha,"Strongly recommended to those who enjoy a rich, entertaining fantasy tale.","It's a shame that viewers outside of Asia tend to shun anime as ""kid's stuff"". Though the Inuyasha anime series seems to be directed at a predominantly teen aged audience even in Japan, Rumiko Takahashi is a master storyteller and Inuyasha nonetheless appeals to people of all different ages, genders and backgrounds. Nobody spins a tale like Takahashi and Inuyasha is a brilliant example of her skill. Weaving a complex storyline interspersed with action, fantasy, the innocence of young love, and a cast of endearing though fallible characters, Inuyasha is a rich fantasy tale drawn from Japanese mythology and set in feudal Japan. Names and references to actual Japanese historical and mythological characters interwoven into the story gives this series added texture and richness not readily found in most graphic novels. Takahashi lightens the serious tone at times with uniquely Takahashi humor (often imitated, never duplicated) and creates credible, flawed characters whose shortcomings become endearing over time. If the animation is too childish for you, try reading the original graphic novel series, which is even more outstanding since the anime doesn't do Takahashi's comic timing any justice. Strongly recommended to those who enjoy a rich, entertaining fantasy tale."
Inuyasha,"""SIT BOY!!!!""","InuYasha is an excellent anime series with everything a good TV series needs. Its got action, suspense, comedy and love. Inuyasha is about the adventures of a young half-demon from futile Japan and a human girl from modern times.

They team up with a monk and a demon slayer to find sacred jewel shards and destroy an evil demon. The animation is really good. What you have to remember is this is a TV series and not a movie. TV series never look as good as movies. I've seen some bad animation and this is NOT one of them.

The music is great and the voice actors fit the characters perfectly. All-Around : great show with few (if any) flaws. Any anime fan who loves fantasy will adore this show."
Inuyasha,Perfect show! Something for everyone!,"Inuyasha is basically the perfect anime show. It's not intended for children, since Inuyasha likes to curse a lot, and there tends to be some brief nudity occasionally. But other than that, this show has something for everyone! It is a romance, a comedy, a fantasy, action, adventure, a drama, and even an occasional scare from the demons they have to fight.

The story itself is fantastic, and each character has their own wonderful personality. You find yourself loving each one. Especially Kagome and Inuyasha. You're always wondering what their next fight will be about. Every episode is terrific, you're always drawn into the story, and you're always left wondering what happens next. Watch it once, and you're hooked!"

Inuyasha,Has Brought Back My Love For Anime!,"Inuyasha is the best anime series I have seen and the one that Iam obsessed with right now. I love it! It has everything a series should have: well defined characters that make you fall in love with them, humor, suspense, the ability to grab your attention and hold it, excitement, great lines and dialog, characters that have a personality that no doubt everyone can find one to relate themselves and become a fan of, an engaging storyline that doesn't slow down, malicious villains and lovable heroes, great animation and voice actors that have voices that match there characters perfectly. When I was small mostly all my favorite shows were anime and when I grew up and my anime shows all came to an end I started watching shows with people and forgot about anime until Inuyahsa that is. I remember being on the computer and on yahoo's box of entertainment of what the world is searching for I saw that people were looking up anime and a list of the most popular and searched for anime of all time and Inuyahsa was number one. I read a summary for it and become interested so I asked my friend who loves anime about it and he told me it was his favorite anime series right now. I started watching it and immediately I got hooked. Now I watch it all the time. I got caught up on the first 50 or so episodes by the season box sets which are great. I bought them during my march break and watched all 54 episodes in a week, it was awesome. And now I never miss the new ones. I'm always there on Fridays at 9:00 watching it with my eyes glued on the screen and by behind glued on the couch. I recommend it to all anime lovers and to everyone who loves a great adventure with action, romance, lots of humor and unforgettable characters. But a warning it will make you fall in love with demons!"
Inuyasha,"InuYasha is a very good show, some of the things are just dragged on for too long and make it lose its magic...","Well I think it's actually a pretty good show. Original concept, and I like the characters.

One thing I do think though is that it dragged on too long, a lot of things did. InuYasha should have forgotten Kikyo early on into the series, Kikyo should have died early on and stayed dead, and there were too many filler episodes with the same battle sequences. Some of the characters just get tiresome as well.

The whole Kikyo thing.. Blablabla, give me a break. I actually prefer Kikyo over Kagome but for one, she's way too old for InuYasha. He acts like he's 16ish whereas she's about 23. Another thing, well, would they just let her be? It's been fifty years, he has Kagome now. To what purpose she was brought back I have no clue. It might have been to cause some type of confusion in Kagome and InuYasha's romance, but it didn't work. Episode 48, where InuYasha chooses Kikyo, sort of changed my idea of the whole series. I was madly in love with it until then.. when I started to just find it all a bit tiresome.

The search for the sacred jewel shards definitely goes on far longer than it should. But I guess they just had no ideas of what to do after? They should have just ended the series, instead of just cutting it off randomly and leaving so many people wondering what eventually happens. There are a lot of filler episodes that make you feel as though you've wasted half an hour.

Some of the antics by the characters (eg, Kagome's ""sit"", Miroku's obsession with women, Naraku in general) also dragged on far too long.

I agree with the people who say to only watch about half of them, they just get a bit annoying after a while.

There are a lot of good things (that I won't name.. I don't feel like typing much more), those are just the bad ones. I appreciate this series very much and it will always hold a place in my heart (it was the first anime I really loved, that's why).

I still love the show, and watch it a lot. Those are just what I've noticed in this while..."
Inuyasha,Inuyasha,"I love watching Inuyasha, I've been watching for quite awhile now. My favorite characters are Inuyasha(he is so cute0, Kagome, Shippo, Sesshomaru, Miroku, Sango, Shippo and Kilala. I have three of the Inuyasha movies. Me and my best friend made up a game where we meet the Inuyasha characters and we end up falling in love with our favorite characters (Inuyasha and Sesshomaru), getting married and have kids. My younger sister also likes it. I like it when Kagome tells Inuyasha to sit when she gets mad at him. I hate Kikyo, Koga and Naraku. So if you haven't seen this show yet, watch it, I'm sure you'll like it because I do."
Inuyasha,It's ok,"It starts well developing its characters and maintaining a good pacing until after several arcs where nothing of importance happens and the plot begins to spin in circles, yet at least it is cool and entertaining."
Inuyasha,An anime that features stories from ancient Japan.,"As someone who has observed every single Japanese urban legend and ancient myths from ancient Japan, I absolutely love this anime and I can guarantee you that you will love this anime as much as I did."
Inuyasha,Another great Shounen,"Kagome Higurashi, a 15-year-old schoolgirl from modern-day Tokyo, is transported to the Sengoku period universe of Japan after falling into a well in her family shrine, where she meets the half-demon, Inuyasha. While, they get close to each other, an evil Naraku plots to acquire Shikon Jewel to increase his powers and removes weakness. He is confronted as that would put Kagome's life in danger.

Even though the characterization is like any other typical Shounen, for example - there is Sesshoumaru with a Sasuke-syndrome and that always puts him at odds with Inuyasha and those terrifying and savage villains, who meet strange downfall because of some plot twists from another more powerful spirit, the concept is very beautiful and unique. There are many sub-plots, which only add excitement to this series. The animation, action scenes and the soundtracks are also likeable. Despite that, I felt that the justice has not been with Moryomaru's character. We deserved to know more about him."
Inuyasha,It had a good start... but lost its originality early on.,Comentario no disponible
Inuyasha,Awesome show!,"If you liked Ranma 1/2, it is safe to say that you'd most likely enjoy InuYasha. Based off of the manga of the same title by Takahashi Rumiko, this is the tale of the half-demon Inuyasha and his companions Kagome, Miroku (aka: Houshi-sama), Sango, Shippou, and sometimes Myouga the youkai flea (more in the earlier season than later ones) as they search for the shards of the Shikon no Tama (Jewel of Four Souls), then hunt for the demon Naraku.

The series is a juvenile one, but not offensively so. I really enjoy the epic nature of the series. There are the standard ""filler"" episodes, but there are long stretches where the story just presses on. The writers often don't feel pressed to end the story withing the 30-minute format and so a certain tale can go on for a few episodes. Filler episodes are used to allow the viewers (and the writers) to catch their breath before plunging in again. But in recent episodes (starting at the late 90's into the 110's), the stories have dragged much longer than they should, just to extend things (IMO). However, things have improved with the current season in Japan. The fun filler episodes are back, but then the action episodes are more like the early season's in nature rather than last season. So my enjoyment has gone back up this year (2004).

Characters are another nice touch to this series. Characters are allowed to grow to a certain degree though relationships don't grow beyond a certain point. I would have liked to have seen Sango and Miroku do more at being a couple rather than just eyeing each other. That may have been fixed in episode 132. Also, I would like the writers to advance the Kagome/Inuyasha romance and we may see that this season. The other problem is that after a while, Inuyasha becomes the only character to do anything. Everyone else just stands around looking stupid rather than jump in and try to help. I hear that it will get better (based on the manga apparently) so I keep my fingers crossed.

The English dub is pretty well done, though the show felt a tad more juvenile in English than it did in Japanese. The DVD subtitles aren't to great, so if you are used to the excellent job done by the fansubbers (Anime-Kraze), you'll be in for some disappointments.

Bottom line: Nicely drawn and interesting characters & good (and sometimes humorous) writing make this otherwise juvenile series very enjoyable to watch."
Sparta,Incredible!,"I don't even know how to describe how much I love Spartacus, both the original and the prequel. I've watched the entire series all the way through at least four or five times because it's just that good. All you have to is read through the reviews to see how beloved this series is. The entire cast is just incredible. I think most people thought when Andy Whitfield tragically died and they had to recast the role of Spartacus that it would drop in quality. It didn't! As good as Whitfield was, Liam McIntyre stepped in and was just as good. It will grab your attention from the first episode and hold it throughout the series. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!"
Sparta,Watching it a second time!,"It's so good I'm watching it all over again. 10 years later it's still holds up. Amid all the glorious violence I had forgotten just how surprisingly emotional this series was. If you have not seen it, watch it!

For fans of Gladiator, Xena, Hercules, and works by Sam Raimi. You need not have seen the original 1960 film Spartacus to enjoy the series as they are not related.

Warning - every episode contains nudity and explicit sex scenes. You have been warned.

And don't forget to watch the 6 episodes of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which aired between seasons one and two, but could be watched after this series. This was basically a holdover for the fans while it was hoped for and assumed by everyone involved that Andy Whitfield's return would be eminent.

Sadly, Andy Whitfield was taken from us a year and a half after the final episode aired. If you like Andy and enjoyed his performance make sure to check out the documentary Be Here Now. RIP Andy Whitfield."
Sparta,Perfect!,"Spartacus is ridiculously underrated and absolutely one of my favorite tv shows ever! It is one of the rare shows where each season is just as incredible as the others, all 4 seasons are fantastic & some of the best tv I've ever seen! I've watched the entire series 3 times already. After the original actor (Andrew Whitfield) who played Spartacus sadly died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after Season 1, they had to recast it and the actor who replaced him (Liam McIntyre) as Spartacus was just as terrific! Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible series immediately...you will not be disappointed! It really is the perfect show!"
Sparta,"You may watch the first episode and want to turn it off, but don't!! Keep watching, it's worth it!!",Comentario no disponible
Sparta,Captivating!,This series rocks! It is full of action packed historical fiction plots. As well as plenty of gratuitous nudity! Hehe
Sparta,"Wasn't expecting much, but.... WOW.","I started watching this very belatedly in early 2019 while waiting for the final season of Game of Thrones. I figured some swords-and-sandals would fit the bill in the meantime.

For the first two episodes, that's exactly what I got. Nothing special; a lot of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and colourful baroque mock-Shakespearean dialogue so over-the-top that I couldn't tell whether the acting was good or not. However, I had seen John Hannah (Batiatus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) in other things before, so I stuck with it.

And damn, did the show hook me quickly after that. Yes, the dialogue is absurd and nobody ever spoke like that, but the actors deliver it with such unrestrained gusto and are clearly having such a blast making the show that you can't help but get swept up in it. Also, the dialogue has the added virtue of being clever and well-written: for example, there's a scene in the final season (don't worry, no spoilers) in which Marcus Crassus is having a discussion with his son Tiberius and a young Julius Caesar. Crassus is speaking to both of them, and they are answering him -- but Crassus is completely oblivious to the fact that Tiberius and Caesar are simultaneously having their own verbal sparring match against each other, while still advancing their three-way discussion. I rewound that scene a few times just to watch it play out.

Gory violence and graphic sex can only sustain a show for so long; fortunately, the characters are beautifully written and developed, and their relationships with each other (romantic or otherwise) are allowed to evolve and progress. By the end of the show I had come to care greatly about the central characters -- and what else could possibly be the mark of well-written characters effectively portrayed?

It's the stuff of TV legend by this point that Andy Whitfield, who gave a virtuoso performance as Spartacus in season one, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after filming wrapped, and that it took his life. The switch to his successor Liam McIntyre took a little bit to get used to, but McIntyre stepped into the unenviable position of taking over from a well-liked and tragically departed predecessor in a central role, and made it his own. No small feat, that.

In closing, if you're not a fan of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and casual profanity, this show won't be for you. If you're a ""fan"" of those things, watch the show, and you'll be surprised by how quickly they take a back seat to the story and the characters. Enjoy!"
Sparta,No need for a long review,"The complete series is an absolute masterpiece. As a former Australia producer I am so proud of the most sincere work not only from the cast but also the crew. Based in New Zealand it brings a complete smorgasbord of the great talents from director, producers, cinematography to a unique editing style and I must impress upon the casting just perfect. To all involved you do yourselves proud and you bring credit to our industry. Job well done!"
Sparta,"An imperfect pilot, but an epic show so far, if you manage look past the blood and nudity.","For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I'm glad I didn't do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as ""gore and sex"" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can't say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the ""bad guys"" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in ""Rome"". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it's not the gore or sex that make it so.

In 300, Rome and even Gladiator, to which Spartacus: Blood and Sand is usually compared, the main characters are free men and women, people who act on their generally free will(yes, even in Gladiator). This show is different. Spartacus: Blood and Sand displays the Roman world through the eyes of the downtrodden, the helpless and the people without rights - the enslaved, THE underdogs, who eventually tried to defy the might of Rome, who lost and lost in an epic and tragic way and in their fall still achieved greatness and immortality. Among the nudity, spilling blood and duel sequences, Spartacus: Blood and Sand shows the viewer why freedom is such a cherished thing, what happens when we lose it and why people throughout time have risen to regain it and died pursuing it or defending it.

Some people mock the characters for being ""one-dimensional"" and demand more complexity. Others have voiced their contempt of the less than accurate representation of ""the complex social system of Rome"". Spartacus: Blood and Sand does not seek to represent the social system. For the people at the bottom of the ladder it was irrelevant whether Sulla was killing senators or Pompeus was gaining power. As for the one-dimensional characters, let me pound the obvious and say this - when you have to kill a friend at the command of your master, or be killed as well, there's no possibility for inner struggle or soul searching. You can't really disobey your master when humiliation, rape, torture and death lie just a whim away.

It's early to say definitely whether Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be a great TV show. It certainly is for now and gets better and better. Unless the creators manage to screw up gigantically, which they have avoided so far, this child of Starz can become epic."
Sparta,This is epic!,"Yes, the show starts out dull and mindless. Yes, the show offers full frontal nudity. Yes, it's bloody violent (if you measure it in buckets of blood). No, it is NOT a storyless show.

To get it out of the way: If you can't stand a naked breast; skip this one. I know how some people are very sensitive to naked skin, but I guess a chopped off head is OK? (Yes, I'm kicking your way you ""Oh, that's Janet Jacksons covered up breast on live TV. I have to call the TV network""-people).

Each episode added a new layer as I see it. The characters grow in dept, and the conspiracies grow ever more entangling. I always wanted to see more after the second episode. The show exploded! For a show like this to even work the producers had to make a choice between kiddy-TV and adult TV. They chose the latter and hit the damn spot. Spartacus Blood and sand is one of the few shows that is just for us ""big kids"". I don't care if people are naked or headless on TV, as long as it suits the show. In this case it had not worked without it. Praise the gods that someone had the guts to think past the double morals of todays television and just press on! Rome was no flower-covered heaven on earth.

The acting can seem stale at first, but each actor grows in their role as the show progresses. A few of them impressed me, as I had deemed them to be c-graded actors a long time ago (Xena, anyone?). Some of the stars of this show seem to have found a show that suited them as much as they suited the roles they had to fill.

To avoid spoilers I will not say much about the story. What I can say is: The story evolves at the same rate as the actors/characters. Nearing the end you will beg for more! It's hard even to catch your breath after what I have just seen: The last episode offers the greatest form of chatarsis I have ever witnessed/felt in a TV show.

I will root for Spartacus in season 2 (and 3, and 4).

Sorry about the spelling errors and such."
Sparta,So bloody good !!,"This is not a series for everyone and many people will find a lot in it offensive. They will have good cause. If you are under 16 you should not watch it. Why am i so excited by it then: For the ones that want to see fights, blood, brutality, sex, men looking like gods, blood, erotica, excitement, blood, swearing, allot of skulls being bashed, sweat, savagery, arena fights, honor, friendships intrigues, assassinations, and lets not forget some more blood, this is a show for you.

It is brutal and it is one of the best shows out there. It is not a soup opera and if you are one of those people that got excited by a show like CAPRICA skip this one.

This show makes your hart race. The first episode is the weakest, but by episode 4 which i just saw i am swearing by all the Roman Gods that this is what i was born to watch. It is raw bloody entertainment!

This show is so unique, it is in a category with THE WIRE, thought they have noting in common and their uniqueness lies in completely different places, they are bot light years away of what is being made.

For a low budget with computer graphics, after the first weaker episode, the show becomes so realistic, by episode 4 it has griped me in its razor sharp clutches and the downward spiral of darkness is leaving bloody marks on my soul!

If you like it you will love it, if you don't like it you will hate it."

Sparta,Changed my life,"Spartacus changed my life in better. Even after the dead of the first actor who played Spartacus, i continued watching and i loved it. It's about force, power, humble, the sense of life, Love and much more. If you need strength or if you are depressed, you must watch Spartacus. Have patience and watch till end. You won't regret it!"
Sparta,Review primarily for Blood and Sand,"Blood and Sand was released in the golden age of TV shows, when they were starting to get good and not just some cheap filler for your Wednesday evening. Netflix had recently started its streaming service, but people are still watching TV every now and then and Spartacus would show up late at night.

Spartacus has everything that today's public truly desires: violence, sex and a good story, mirroring the wishes of the Romans in the gladiatorial age. And Spartacus excels at all of it. The show starts with the warning that the graphic violence is there due to the historical portrayal of ancient Roman society. Yes, that's totally the reason for your boobs and violence: historical accuracy.

If you'd just look at some of the screenshots from this show, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it is utter trash, as you behold a bunch of half-naked bodybuilders and fake blood effects. And while Spartacus is no Citizen Kane and you won't be using it as study material for your history major, it is a surprisingly high-quality show. It's just very stylized and this stylisation can come off as cheap.

Spartacus Blood and Sand as well as its prequel, Spartacus Gods of the Arena, concentrate on the time leading up to the Third Servile War, rather than the rebellion itself. This is an interesting place in time to focus on. The story is mostly that of revenge, but there are a number of other clear-to-understand themes present: corruption in pursuit of power, spectacle, betrayal, identity, social class and of course, bromance. Lots and lots of bromance.

The primary brain behind the show is Steven DeKnight, who's worked on shows like Smallville, which is exactly the kind of show I would name as an example of why I used to hate television shows. It was therefore surprising that the same person who wrote for Smallville also wrote for Spartacus. Apart from a few issues in the first few episodes, Spartacus is comprised of intricate plotlines and has a distinctive dialogue that is generally well thought out. Although the dialogue is theatrical in nature, it is still natural and clear enough to be understood, without being pretentious. The pacing is good throughout the show. The episodes do not drag on and so the material is not stretched beyond its worth, like in so many other shows of the time. The intensity is maintained throughout.

Andy Whitfield's portrayal of Spartacus has surprising depth and intensity for a previously unknown actor, God rest his soul. The classically trained John Hannah was an excellent choice for the ambitious dominus of the gladiatorial school. Jonah gives a deep performance, which in combination with the writing for this character, makes his character far more interesting than Spartacus, who only wants vengeance. Lucy Lawless, as the wife of the dominus, makes the complex relationship with her husband work. It is really cool that the show made the antagonists such believable people with complicated backgrounds and motivations. They did go a bit too far with Craig Parker's Roman legate, but he is not in the first season that much.

Of course, the acting and the dialogue are not without flaws. Sometimes, the character development is hard to buy and the naked warriors in the snow make you wonder if the show let go of its senses for the sake of style, but those flaws are quickly outshined.

With regard to the visuals, the obvious question comes to mind: is Spartacus ripping off the style of 300 (2006)? Yes. Yes, it does. The naked bodybuilders, the intense CGI skies, the excessive blood, the macho culture, and the slow-motion fights. It's all here. The fake blood and the CGI do make it look a bit cheap, but the fakeness becomes a part of the theatrical theme that runs throughout the show, along with the style of dialogue, and frankly, Spartacus overshadows the movie 300 and makes it look like a rip-off from Spartacus rather than the other way around. Even though Spartacus uses a lot of computer effects for its backgrounds, there are also quite a number of detailed sets, that sell this show on a physical level.

Once the rebellion starts, with the 2nd season (technically 3rd, if you could the prequel), called Vengeance, the show lost me. With a different lead actor, due to the death of Andy Whitfield, and following the departure of John Hannah, as the primary antagonist, the show had nothing but CGI and naked models left to prop it up. The rumour is that the other seasons are not bad, once you get used to the new cast. However, what I really like about both Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena is that they have a satisfying end without any major cliffhangers designed to make you watch the next season. So, if you decide to step out at season 1, you can do so without any penalties.

I conclusion, Spartacus is less like a complex wine and more like big juicy steak - great for some, but can be a bit much for others. The grotesque violence and sexual filler make it seems like teenagers are the target audience, but the show proved popular not only with my testosterone filled male friends, but with the ladies as well."

Sparta,"After all these years, this show just rocks on!","I watched the whole Spartacus series back when it first came up and now I'm revisiting it. Still, it does stand it's ground. I had no recollection of Jai Courteney being in the series and I don't like him as an actor but as Varro he is just great. All the acting is great, even when it's over the top, it all just fits together so nicely. Yeah, the GCI is a bit funny now and then but after just a few episodes, I really started to enjoy it. This show is sad, exciting and just pure fun to watch. To Andy: you made such an impression on younger me and you still do. You are a legend."
Sparta,Love it!,"I can't stand much of whats on TV. What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).

As a previous rater stated, the characters have shades of evil and good. Their ethics seems to match what values were imbedded in the roman civilization. The reason there is so much blood and it over indulges is because the show not only explicitly includes sensual dialogue, but the way it is directed and the tactics of capturing violence and glory are not 2D and speak to its sensuality. Bottom line: if you are a passionate person, you will enjoy the dramatic dialogue and poetry, the sexuality, and the brutality."
Sparta,Spartacus is the ultimate series of all,"I don't wanna write a long review, i just wanna put words and thoughts in one sentence : I CAN NEVER WATCH ANY SERIES AFTER WATCHING SPARTACUS"
Sparta,"best TV in well, forever","its been said many times on this site but i want to add by voice, Spartacus is the TV show now and one of the best ever, along with Sons of Anarchy.

sure it started life as a 300 clone but now the story line, acting, characters, plots twists, everything are beyond the best TV and movies ever made. sure, that's a bold claim, but how long does a movie last, even multi-part epics like Godfather and LOTR only last a total of about 7 hours. in only 1 season of Sparticus we've seen characters evolve and schemes develop.

the script writers must be some kind of gods to come up with this. like many, i love that the bad guys aren't all bad, the good guys not all good. all TV and movie writers should study this to see how real characters are developed and stories created.

and the acting, where to start, Andy Whitfield and John Hannah are brilliant and Peter Mensah just owns the screen every time he's on camera. That guy should be the next Denzel or Samuel L Jackson.

and as to those who say 'too much sex, too much violence' i say 'bring it on!'"
Sparta,Some good some not so ...,"I felt skeptical about the upcoming series when I first saw the trailers but thought; maybe it will be better ... the voice-overs did promise greater things. However, from the first episode I felt real disappointment. Rather than being more realistic it's more Hollywood. Yes, it does offer graphic violence - more on that later - and full frontal nudity but it falls short in a number of other areas. But first let me digress to some of the other points: By far the best performance I've enjoyed in this offering is that of John Hannah as Batiatus. His consummate skill as an actor leaves me feeling he deserves more success. His significant other is Lucy Lawless as Lucretia. She is well cast and certainly entertains and keeps up with Hannah. She's beautiful and shows it and comes through feeling like there's a nice bit of underlying intelligence I'd like to know better. One of the most fun characters is Viva Bianca as Ilithyia. She plays the part with a kind of delicious wickedness that's absent malice. She is also quite something special to look at, especially disrobed; which brings us to the male flesh offerings. Andy Whitfield as the title character Spartacus does a credible job but I can't overcome the idea he's in the part because someone in Hollywood thought he'd just look good. His antagonist in much of the episodes I saw is Manu Bennett as the gladiator Crixus and Peter Mensah as Doctore; a sort of gladiator teacher/overseer. Whitfield and Bennett snarl at each other appropriately and put up with full body depilation as their major sacrifice for their art.

The costumes, makeup, sets, and other production are rendered with quality if not historic accuracy. Without researching the issue, I find it hard to swallow the prevalence of depilation. It just doesn't ring true to what I recall from studying ancient history. The ancients were rather proud of their body hair as proof of their maturity and not even females shaved anywhere; none of that is evident here. But I suppose it's a minor point but I just felt that it flew in the face of the claims that they were striving for more historic accuracy. That gets us to the gritty parts, the violence, nudity and sex. The violence depicted here is over-the-top Hollywood all the way. The copious amounts of arterial blood that appear at the slightest wounds just smacks of sensationalist violence rather than accuracy. That - the violence - is a subject I know all too much about. Even severing an artery doesn't produce that much blood that fast. The sort of violence in the real world also produces a good deal more gore; not to mention that none of the film makers can ever hope to duplicate the accompanying odors. Worse, to me, by far is the fact that the bloodiest parts seem to be uniformly rendered in slow motion; thereby seeming to emphasize the bloodiest violence as the most important part of the offering. This aspect disappointed me the most.

The nudity and sex are more realistic than likely anything that has been presented by the modern media thus far, but it still falls far short of the reality of those times. Nudity then was a lot more prevalent, a lot more common and a lot more matter-of-fact.

I found it curious that the violence is far more emphasized that any other part of the equation; even the nudity and sex. I had the certain thought that if the sex were given an emphasis equal to that of the violence then we'd be treated to full screen sized vaginas opening in slow motion. It all left me feeling that the sad fact is that violence - even the most brutal types of depictions - are still far more socially acceptable than the relatively calm and peaceful pursuits involving nudity and sex. That still feels like an indictment against modern society. At least the ancients were more-or-less uniformly and honestly depraved. If I watch the remainder of the series it will more than likely be to enjoy the non-violent performances of Hannah, Lawless and Bianca. They are the best of it."
Sparta,"Bloody, sexy and very entertaining - but not for the easily offended","If you want a series about Roman history, one can watch HBO's Rome (a very fine TV show). If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.

Supposedly, TV shows are by necessity tamer than movies, yet I haven't seen any movie as consistently graphic about sex and violence as Spartacus. Suffice to say that almost everybody in the large cast of mostly muscular men and gorgeous women, gets naked in the series at some point. Episode 9 in particular – subtly called ""Whore"" – is a highlight in that regard.

A bit slow to start (I struggled with episode 1, but get hooked after episode 2), this admittedly not for all tastes series, was filmed in New Zealand with a mostly Australian and Kiwi cast. Its striking visual style can be compared with 300 (the gladiator's trainer, the great Peter Mensah, had a small role in that movie). The show is finely led in the titular role by Andy Whitfield (unfortunately he died of cancer after the first season, and was replaced by another actor in the following season). Yet, even if most of the cast is great, the best performance to me is by John Hannah as the devious Batiatus, the owner of the Gladiator's school. Hannah, whose background has been mostly on British comedies, excels here. While he initially seems to lack the toughness one supposes a master of a gladiator's school should have, he is eventually seen as a charming yet also very cruel and cunning man. Also remarkable are the performances of Manu Bennett as the knucklehead (but eventually noble) gladiator Crixus, Viva Bianca as the gorgeous but scheming Ilythia, and Nick Tarabay as Batiatus slimy aide, Ashur."
Sparta,Starts off weak and slow but grows fast and furious.,Comentario no disponible
Sparta,AWFUL! Simply AWFUL!!! Stick with 1960 version with Kirk Douglas & Laurence Olivier,"I went into this with a skeptical attitude and wanted it to be great! I love Epics and being a fan of the Epics of the 1950's and 1960's, and the original SPARTACUS with Kirk Douglas in particular, I was very interested in what would be done with this version. I have no problem with differences in the interpretation of the story since the true history of the actual Spartacus is very sketchy. Historians know very little about many of the details in his life and the military campaigns, so I'm open to changes in one dramatic version over another.

The problem I have is mainly with the production values of this version. Let's start with the script. I realize that all films cannot take the course of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE Christ and present a subtitled film with the actors speaking the original language of the historical period. Kevin Costner brilliantly used this technique as well with the Native Americans in DANCES WITH WOLVES. However, a film maker doesn't have to take it to that extreme. In the historical epics of the past, scripts were often careful to not include dialog which sounded too contemporary in order to give it the illusion of a past time. This helps the audience's acceptance of the story having taken place in times past. Ben-Hur (1959) is a good example of this. Spartacus (1960) has some dialog problems but is also, for the most part, a good example of this.

That said, this version of SPARTACUS seems to go out of it's way to sound every bit like Martin Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, complete with use of the F-bomb every couple minutes along with every other contemporary expletive one might imagine, including the ""C"" word, the ""B"" word, the ""S"" word, etc. Simply put...It sounds absurd. Can we at least try to give this some semblance of ancient history. With the expletives and the grunting and groaning of the muscle bound performers during the battle scenes, it sounds and looks like the warriors originated with the WWE.

Next up is the violence. I stop short of referring to the violence as exploitive, which it is, but it is SO extreme that it is silly. The use of slow motion, normal motion, slow motion, normal motion mixed with squirting blood all over the camera, all over the other actors, squirting out fast, squirting out slow from this angle and that angle is once again, absurd. It is SO overdone that one is desensitized after watching 45 minutes of the first episode. At one point a character gets punched in the face and even THAT is in slow motion. It's laughable! This viewer got the impression that this was being filmed by students in a high school film class who couldn't get enough slow motion and gory blood spilling. Most of the blood spilling is CGI anyway and looks fake.

That brings up my next criticism. I highly doubt that there is one scene in this travesty that was filmed on location. EVERYTHING, including the most simple scene appears to use the CGI technique and it makes the entire production look like one massive computer game.

Next we have the overuse of sex scenes which are equally as silly as the violence as they are all choreographed to look like the covers of cheap romance novels with men who look like they're from Chippendales and women who look like they stepped out of the Victoria's Secret catalog. No one looks natural. It's buffed bodies and big boobs. Because of the sexually explicit nature of some of the scenes, I can't go into detail here. I guess the tamest way to put it is that some decadent scenes appear as if they were filmed in an S&M club.

This is truly an exploitive piece of garbage that falls just short of being pornography....bad acting and all, but I'm sure it will find an audience. After all, Shakespeare said it best, this kind of exploitation is there to ""Split the ears of the groundlings who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."""
Amateur,Incredible!,"I don't even know how to describe how much I love Spartacus, both the original and the prequel. I've watched the entire series all the way through at least four or five times because it's just that good. All you have to is read through the reviews to see how beloved this series is. The entire cast is just incredible. I think most people thought when Andy Whitfield tragically died and they had to recast the role of Spartacus that it would drop in quality. It didn't! As good as Whitfield was, Liam McIntyre stepped in and was just as good. It will grab your attention from the first episode and hold it throughout the series. If you haven't seen this amazing show yet stop what you're doing right now and go watch it!"
Amateur,Watching it a second time!,"It's so good I'm watching it all over again. 10 years later it's still holds up. Amid all the glorious violence I had forgotten just how surprisingly emotional this series was. If you have not seen it, watch it!

For fans of Gladiator, Xena, Hercules, and works by Sam Raimi. You need not have seen the original 1960 film Spartacus to enjoy the series as they are not related.

Warning - every episode contains nudity and explicit sex scenes. You have been warned.

And don't forget to watch the 6 episodes of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which aired between seasons one and two, but could be watched after this series. This was basically a holdover for the fans while it was hoped for and assumed by everyone involved that Andy Whitfield's return would be eminent.

Sadly, Andy Whitfield was taken from us a year and a half after the final episode aired. If you like Andy and enjoyed his performance make sure to check out the documentary Be Here Now. RIP Andy Whitfield."
Amateur,Perfect!,"Spartacus is ridiculously underrated and absolutely one of my favorite tv shows ever! It is one of the rare shows where each season is just as incredible as the others, all 4 seasons are fantastic & some of the best tv I've ever seen! I've watched the entire series 3 times already. After the original actor (Andrew Whitfield) who played Spartacus sadly died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after Season 1, they had to recast it and the actor who replaced him (Liam McIntyre) as Spartacus was just as terrific! Do yourself a favor and watch this incredible series immediately...you will not be disappointed! It really is the perfect show!"

Amateur,Captivating!,This series rocks! It is full of action packed historical fiction plots. As well as plenty of gratuitous nudity! Hehe
Amateur,"Wasn't expecting much, but.... WOW.","I started watching this very belatedly in early 2019 while waiting for the final season of Game of Thrones. I figured some swords-and-sandals would fit the bill in the meantime.

For the first two episodes, that's exactly what I got. Nothing special; a lot of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and colourful baroque mock-Shakespearean dialogue so over-the-top that I couldn't tell whether the acting was good or not. However, I had seen John Hannah (Batiatus) and Lucy Lawless (Lucretia) in other things before, so I stuck with it.

And damn, did the show hook me quickly after that. Yes, the dialogue is absurd and nobody ever spoke like that, but the actors deliver it with such unrestrained gusto and are clearly having such a blast making the show that you can't help but get swept up in it. Also, the dialogue has the added virtue of being clever and well-written: for example, there's a scene in the final season (don't worry, no spoilers) in which Marcus Crassus is having a discussion with his son Tiberius and a young Julius Caesar. Crassus is speaking to both of them, and they are answering him -- but Crassus is completely oblivious to the fact that Tiberius and Caesar are simultaneously having their own verbal sparring match against each other, while still advancing their three-way discussion. I rewound that scene a few times just to watch it play out.

Gory violence and graphic sex can only sustain a show for so long; fortunately, the characters are beautifully written and developed, and their relationships with each other (romantic or otherwise) are allowed to evolve and progress. By the end of the show I had come to care greatly about the central characters -- and what else could possibly be the mark of well-written characters effectively portrayed?

It's the stuff of TV legend by this point that Andy Whitfield, who gave a virtuoso performance as Spartacus in season one, was diagnosed with cancer shortly after filming wrapped, and that it took his life. The switch to his successor Liam McIntyre took a little bit to get used to, but McIntyre stepped into the unenviable position of taking over from a well-liked and tragically departed predecessor in a central role, and made it his own. No small feat, that.

In closing, if you're not a fan of gory violence, graphic sex and nudity, and casual profanity, this show won't be for you. If you're a ""fan"" of those things, watch the show, and you'll be surprised by how quickly they take a back seat to the story and the characters. Enjoy!"
Amateur,No need for a long review,"The complete series is an absolute masterpiece. As a former Australia producer I am so proud of the most sincere work not only from the cast but also the crew. Based in New Zealand it brings a complete smorgasbord of the great talents from director, producers, cinematography to a unique editing style and I must impress upon the casting just perfect. To all involved you do yourselves proud and you bring credit to our industry. Job well done!"
Amateur,"An imperfect pilot, but an epic show so far, if you manage look past the blood and nudity.","For me the pilot was something of a mix between the graphic violence of 300(it even includes somewhat similar battle sequences), the sex of 300, the idea of Gladiator and a bit of Rome. I almost stopped watching it and I'm glad I didn't do it. People would see the first episode and dismiss it as ""gore and sex"" time-wasting perversity. And they would be mistaken. The plot, filled with at first glance one-dimensional characters, is so varied, so deep, full of plot twists and unpredictable outcomes that you may find yourself glued to the screen.The sex is still there, the sexy images as well(muscular men and beautiful women), but the characters have gained so much depth and perspective, that you can't say someone is just white or black(with two exceptions). There are so many shades of gray in between, that most of the times even if you want to hate a character for plotting against the protagonist, you find yourself siding with him on another level. The protagonist is not a saint, the ""bad guys"" show they can love and cherish, and you see the other side of mighty Rome, the one not shown in ""Rome"". This show, even after the less than spectacular pilot, can be and for the moment is great and it's not the gore or sex that make it so.

In 300, Rome and even Gladiator, to which Spartacus: Blood and Sand is usually compared, the main characters are free men and women, people who act on their generally free will(yes, even in Gladiator). This show is different. Spartacus: Blood and Sand displays the Roman world through the eyes of the downtrodden, the helpless and the people without rights - the enslaved, THE underdogs, who eventually tried to defy the might of Rome, who lost and lost in an epic and tragic way and in their fall still achieved greatness and immortality. Among the nudity, spilling blood and duel sequences, Spartacus: Blood and Sand shows the viewer why freedom is such a cherished thing, what happens when we lose it and why people throughout time have risen to regain it and died pursuing it or defending it.

Some people mock the characters for being ""one-dimensional"" and demand more complexity. Others have voiced their contempt of the less than accurate representation of ""the complex social system of Rome"". Spartacus: Blood and Sand does not seek to represent the social system. For the people at the bottom of the ladder it was irrelevant whether Sulla was killing senators or Pompeus was gaining power. As for the one-dimensional characters, let me pound the obvious and say this - when you have to kill a friend at the command of your master, or be killed as well, there's no possibility for inner struggle or soul searching. You can't really disobey your master when humiliation, rape, torture and death lie just a whim away.

It's early to say definitely whether Spartacus: Blood and Sand will be a great TV show. It certainly is for now and gets better and better. Unless the creators manage to screw up gigantically, which they have avoided so far, this child of Starz can become epic."
Amateur,This is epic!,"Yes, the show starts out dull and mindless. Yes, the show offers full frontal nudity. Yes, it's bloody violent (if you measure it in buckets of blood). No, it is NOT a storyless show.

To get it out of the way: If you can't stand a naked breast; skip this one. I know how some people are very sensitive to naked skin, but I guess a chopped off head is OK? (Yes, I'm kicking your way you ""Oh, that's Janet Jacksons covered up breast on live TV. I have to call the TV network""-people).

Each episode added a new layer as I see it. The characters grow in dept, and the conspiracies grow ever more entangling. I always wanted to see more after the second episode. The show exploded! For a show like this to even work the producers had to make a choice between kiddy-TV and adult TV. They chose the latter and hit the damn spot. Spartacus Blood and sand is one of the few shows that is just for us ""big kids"". I don't care if people are naked or headless on TV, as long as it suits the show. In this case it had not worked without it. Praise the gods that someone had the guts to think past the double morals of todays television and just press on! Rome was no flower-covered heaven on earth.

The acting can seem stale at first, but each actor grows in their role as the show progresses. A few of them impressed me, as I had deemed them to be c-graded actors a long time ago (Xena, anyone?). Some of the stars of this show seem to have found a show that suited them as much as they suited the roles they had to fill.

To avoid spoilers I will not say much about the story. What I can say is: The story evolves at the same rate as the actors/characters. Nearing the end you will beg for more! It's hard even to catch your breath after what I have just seen: The last episode offers the greatest form of chatarsis I have ever witnessed/felt in a TV show.

I will root for Spartacus in season 2 (and 3, and 4).

Sorry about the spelling errors and such."
Amateur,So bloody good !!,"This is not a series for everyone and many people will find a lot in it offensive. They will have good cause. If you are under 16 you should not watch it. Why am i so excited by it then: For the ones that want to see fights, blood, brutality, sex, men looking like gods, blood, erotica, excitement, blood, swearing, allot of skulls being bashed, sweat, savagery, arena fights, honor, friendships intrigues, assassinations, and lets not forget some more blood, this is a show for you.

It is brutal and it is one of the best shows out there. It is not a soup opera and if you are one of those people that got excited by a show like CAPRICA skip this one.

This show makes your hart race. The first episode is the weakest, but by episode 4 which i just saw i am swearing by all the Roman Gods that this is what i was born to watch. It is raw bloody entertainment!

This show is so unique, it is in a category with THE WIRE, thought they have noting in common and their uniqueness lies in completely different places, they are bot light years away of what is being made.

For a low budget with computer graphics, after the first weaker episode, the show becomes so realistic, by episode 4 it has griped me in its razor sharp clutches and the downward spiral of darkness is leaving bloody marks on my soul!

Amateur,Review primarily for Blood and Sand,"Blood and Sand was released in the golden age of TV shows, when they were starting to get good and not just some cheap filler for your Wednesday evening. Netflix had recently started its streaming service, but people are still watching TV every now and then and Spartacus would show up late at night.

Spartacus has everything that today's public truly desires: violence, sex and a good story, mirroring the wishes of the Romans in the gladiatorial age. And Spartacus excels at all of it. The show starts with the warning that the graphic violence is there due to the historical portrayal of ancient Roman society. Yes, that's totally the reason for your boobs and violence: historical accuracy.

If you'd just look at some of the screenshots from this show, you'd be forgiven for thinking that it is utter trash, as you behold a bunch of half-naked bodybuilders and fake blood effects. And while Spartacus is no Citizen Kane and you won't be using it as study material for your history major, it is a surprisingly high-quality show. It's just very stylized and this stylisation can come off as cheap.

Spartacus Blood and Sand as well as its prequel, Spartacus Gods of the Arena, concentrate on the time leading up to the Third Servile War, rather than the rebellion itself. This is an interesting place in time to focus on. The story is mostly that of revenge, but there are a number of other clear-to-understand themes present: corruption in pursuit of power, spectacle, betrayal, identity, social class and of course, bromance. Lots and lots of bromance.

The primary brain behind the show is Steven DeKnight, who's worked on shows like Smallville, which is exactly the kind of show I would name as an example of why I used to hate television shows. It was therefore surprising that the same person who wrote for Smallville also wrote for Spartacus. Apart from a few issues in the first few episodes, Spartacus is comprised of intricate plotlines and has a distinctive dialogue that is generally well thought out. Although the dialogue is theatrical in nature, it is still natural and clear enough to be understood, without being pretentious. The pacing is good throughout the show. The episodes do not drag on and so the material is not stretched beyond its worth, like in so many other shows of the time. The intensity is maintained throughout.

Andy Whitfield's portrayal of Spartacus has surprising depth and intensity for a previously unknown actor, God rest his soul. The classically trained John Hannah was an excellent choice for the ambitious dominus of the gladiatorial school. Jonah gives a deep performance, which in combination with the writing for this character, makes his character far more interesting than Spartacus, who only wants vengeance. Lucy Lawless, as the wife of the dominus, makes the complex relationship with her husband work. It is really cool that the show made the antagonists such believable people with complicated backgrounds and motivations. They did go a bit too far with Craig Parker's Roman legate, but he is not in the first season that much.

Of course, the acting and the dialogue are not without flaws. Sometimes, the character development is hard to buy and the naked warriors in the snow make you wonder if the show let go of its senses for the sake of style, but those flaws are quickly outshined.

With regard to the visuals, the obvious question comes to mind: is Spartacus ripping off the style of 300 (2006)? Yes. Yes, it does. The naked bodybuilders, the intense CGI skies, the excessive blood, the macho culture, and the slow-motion fights. It's all here. The fake blood and the CGI do make it look a bit cheap, but the fakeness becomes a part of the theatrical theme that runs throughout the show, along with the style of dialogue, and frankly, Spartacus overshadows the movie 300 and makes it look like a rip-off from Spartacus rather than the other way around. Even though Spartacus uses a lot of computer effects for its backgrounds, there are also quite a number of detailed sets, that sell this show on a physical level.

Once the rebellion starts, with the 2nd season (technically 3rd, if you could the prequel), called Vengeance, the show lost me. With a different lead actor, due to the death of Andy Whitfield, and following the departure of John Hannah, as the primary antagonist, the show had nothing but CGI and naked models left to prop it up. The rumour is that the other seasons are not bad, once you get used to the new cast. However, what I really like about both Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena is that they have a satisfying end without any major cliffhangers designed to make you watch the next season. So, if you decide to step out at season 1, you can do so without any penalties.

I conclusion, Spartacus is less like a complex wine and more like big juicy steak - great for some, but can be a bit much for others. The grotesque violence and sexual filler make it seems like teenagers are the target audience, but the show proved popular not only with my testosterone filled male friends, but with the ladies as well."

Amateur,"After all these years, this show just rocks on!","I watched the whole Spartacus series back when it first came up and now I'm revisiting it. Still, it does stand it's ground. I had no recollection of Jai Courteney being in the series and I don't like him as an actor but as Varro he is just great. All the acting is great, even when it's over the top, it all just fits together so nicely. Yeah, the GCI is a bit funny now and then but after just a few episodes, I really started to enjoy it. This show is sad, exciting and just pure fun to watch. To Andy: you made such an impression on younger me and you still do. You are a legend."
Amateur,Love it!,"I can't stand much of whats on TV. What I love about this show is the amount of sensuality and poetry it brings to the table, while not being sensory with respect to sexuality, violence, and ethics. I usually hate romance, but the romance in this movie is genuine, there are several forms of love and lust that are identified in the episodes. The fact that they have homosexuality in it despite possible conflicting interest--what would seem to attract small target audience--does suggest a good portrayal of sexuality at that time (Although i doubt that only a couple of them would be subject to homosexual lust because many of the mentors and mentees mated at that time).

As a previous rater stated, the characters have shades of evil and good. Their ethics seems to match what values were imbedded in the roman civilization. The reason there is so much blood and it over indulges is because the show not only explicitly includes sensual dialogue, but the way it is directed and the tactics of capturing violence and glory are not 2D and speak to its sensuality. Bottom line: if you are a passionate person, you will enjoy the dramatic dialogue and poetry, the sexuality, and the brutality."
Amateur,Spartacus is the ultimate series of all,"I don't wanna write a long review, i just wanna put words and thoughts in one sentence : I CAN NEVER WATCH ANY SERIES AFTER WATCHING SPARTACUS"
Amateur,"best TV in well, forever","its been said many times on this site but i want to add by voice, Spartacus is the TV show now and one of the best ever, along with Sons of Anarchy.

sure it started life as a 300 clone but now the story line, acting, characters, plots twists, everything are beyond the best TV and movies ever made. sure, that's a bold claim, but how long does a movie last, even multi-part epics like Godfather and LOTR only last a total of about 7 hours. in only 1 season of Sparticus we've seen characters evolve and schemes develop.

the script writers must be some kind of gods to come up with this. like many, i love that the bad guys aren't all bad, the good guys not all good. all TV and movie writers should study this to see how real characters are developed and stories created.

and the acting, where to start, Andy Whitfield and John Hannah are brilliant and Peter Mensah just owns the screen every time he's on camera. That guy should be the next Denzel or Samuel L Jackson.

and as to those who say 'too much sex, too much violence' i say 'bring it on!'"
Amateur,Some good some not so ...,"I felt skeptical about the upcoming series when I first saw the trailers but thought; maybe it will be better ... the voice-overs did promise greater things. However, from the first episode I felt real disappointment. Rather than being more realistic it's more Hollywood. Yes, it does offer graphic violence - more on that later - and full frontal nudity but it falls short in a number of other areas. But first let me digress to some of the other points: By far the best performance I've enjoyed in this offering is that of John Hannah as Batiatus. His consummate skill as an actor leaves me feeling he deserves more success. His significant other is Lucy Lawless as Lucretia. She is well cast and certainly entertains and keeps up with Hannah. She's beautiful and shows it and comes through feeling like there's a nice bit of underlying intelligence I'd like to know better. One of the most fun characters is Viva Bianca as Ilithyia. She plays the part with a kind of delicious wickedness that's absent malice. She is also quite something special to look at, especially disrobed; which brings us to the male flesh offerings. Andy Whitfield as the title character Spartacus does a credible job but I can't overcome the idea he's in the part because someone in Hollywood thought he'd just look good. His antagonist in much of the episodes I saw is Manu Bennett as the gladiator Crixus and Peter Mensah as Doctore; a sort of gladiator teacher/overseer. Whitfield and Bennett snarl at each other appropriately and put up with full body depilation as their major sacrifice for their art.

The costumes, makeup, sets, and other production are rendered with quality if not historic accuracy. Without researching the issue, I find it hard to swallow the prevalence of depilation. It just doesn't ring true to what I recall from studying ancient history. The ancients were rather proud of their body hair as proof of their maturity and not even females shaved anywhere; none of that is evident here. But I suppose it's a minor point but I just felt that it flew in the face of the claims that they were striving for more historic accuracy. That gets us to the gritty parts, the violence, nudity and sex. The violence depicted here is over-the-top Hollywood all the way. The copious amounts of arterial blood that appear at the slightest wounds just smacks of sensationalist violence rather than accuracy. That - the violence - is a subject I know all too much about. Even severing an artery doesn't produce that much blood that fast. The sort of violence in the real world also produces a good deal more gore; not to mention that none of the film makers can ever hope to duplicate the accompanying odors. Worse, to me, by far is the fact that the bloodiest parts seem to be uniformly rendered in slow motion; thereby seeming to emphasize the bloodiest violence as the most important part of the offering. This aspect disappointed me the most.

The nudity and sex are more realistic than likely anything that has been presented by the modern media thus far, but it still falls far short of the reality of those times. Nudity then was a lot more prevalent, a lot more common and a lot more matter-of-fact.

I found it curious that the violence is far more emphasized that any other part of the equation; even the nudity and sex. I had the certain thought that if the sex were given an emphasis equal to that of the violence then we'd be treated to full screen sized vaginas opening in slow motion. It all left me feeling that the sad fact is that violence - even the most brutal types of depictions - are still far more socially acceptable than the relatively calm and peaceful pursuits involving nudity and sex. That still feels like an indictment against modern society. At least the ancients were more-or-less uniformly and honestly depraved. If I watch the remainder of the series it will more than likely be to enjoy the non-violent performances of Hannah, Lawless and Bianca. They are the best of it."
Amateur,"Bloody, sexy and very entertaining - but not for the easily offended","If you want a series about Roman history, one can watch HBO's Rome (a very fine TV show). If you want to see a trashy and outrageously entertaining TV show with nonstop gore and nudity (both male and female) as well as graphic sex, Spartacus (very loosely based on the history of Ancient Rome's slave gladiator turned rebel leader) should be the choice.

Supposedly, TV shows are by necessity tamer than movies, yet I haven't seen any movie as consistently graphic about sex and violence as Spartacus. Suffice to say that almost everybody in the large cast of mostly muscular men and gorgeous women, gets naked in the series at some point. Episode 9 in particular – subtly called ""Whore"" – is a highlight in that regard.

A bit slow to start (I struggled with episode 1, but get hooked after episode 2), this admittedly not for all tastes series, was filmed in New Zealand with a mostly Australian and Kiwi cast. Its striking visual style can be compared with 300 (the gladiator's trainer, the great Peter Mensah, had a small role in that movie). The show is finely led in the titular role by Andy Whitfield (unfortunately he died of cancer after the first season, and was replaced by another actor in the following season). Yet, even if most of the cast is great, the best performance to me is by John Hannah as the devious Batiatus, the owner of the Gladiator's school. Hannah, whose background has been mostly on British comedies, excels here. While he initially seems to lack the toughness one supposes a master of a gladiator's school should have, he is eventually seen as a charming yet also very cruel and cunning man. Also remarkable are the performances of Manu Bennett as the knucklehead (but eventually noble) gladiator Crixus, Viva Bianca as the gorgeous but scheming Ilythia, and Nick Tarabay as Batiatus slimy aide, Ashur."

Amateur,AWFUL! Simply AWFUL!!! Stick with 1960 version with Kirk Douglas & Laurence Olivier,"I went into this with a skeptical attitude and wanted it to be great! I love Epics and being a fan of the Epics of the 1950's and 1960's, and the original SPARTACUS with Kirk Douglas in particular, I was very interested in what would be done with this version. I have no problem with differences in the interpretation of the story since the true history of the actual Spartacus is very sketchy. Historians know very little about many of the details in his life and the military campaigns, so I'm open to changes in one dramatic version over another.

The problem I have is mainly with the production values of this version. Let's start with the script. I realize that all films cannot take the course of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE Christ and present a subtitled film with the actors speaking the original language of the historical period. Kevin Costner brilliantly used this technique as well with the Native Americans in DANCES WITH WOLVES. However, a film maker doesn't have to take it to that extreme. In the historical epics of the past, scripts were often careful to not include dialog which sounded too contemporary in order to give it the illusion of a past time. This helps the audience's acceptance of the story having taken place in times past. Ben-Hur (1959) is a good example of this. Spartacus (1960) has some dialog problems but is also, for the most part, a good example of this.

That said, this version of SPARTACUS seems to go out of it's way to sound every bit like Martin Scorcese's GOODFELLAS, complete with use of the F-bomb every couple minutes along with every other contemporary expletive one might imagine, including the ""C"" word, the ""B"" word, the ""S"" word, etc. Simply put...It sounds absurd. Can we at least try to give this some semblance of ancient history. With the expletives and the grunting and groaning of the muscle bound performers during the battle scenes, it sounds and looks like the warriors originated with the WWE.

Next up is the violence. I stop short of referring to the violence as exploitive, which it is, but it is SO extreme that it is silly. The use of slow motion, normal motion, slow motion, normal motion mixed with squirting blood all over the camera, all over the other actors, squirting out fast, squirting out slow from this angle and that angle is once again, absurd. It is SO overdone that one is desensitized after watching 45 minutes of the first episode. At one point a character gets punched in the face and even THAT is in slow motion. It's laughable! This viewer got the impression that this was being filmed by students in a high school film class who couldn't get enough slow motion and gory blood spilling. Most of the blood spilling is CGI anyway and looks fake.

That brings up my next criticism. I highly doubt that there is one scene in this travesty that was filmed on location. EVERYTHING, including the most simple scene appears to use the CGI technique and it makes the entire production look like one massive computer game.

Next we have the overuse of sex scenes which are equally as silly as the violence as they are all choreographed to look like the covers of cheap romance novels with men who look like they're from Chippendales and women who look like they stepped out of the Victoria's Secret catalog. No one looks natural. It's buffed bodies and big boobs. Because of the sexually explicit nature of some of the scenes, I can't go into detail here. I guess the tamest way to put it is that some decadent scenes appear as if they were filmed in an S&M club.

This is truly an exploitive piece of garbage that falls just short of being pornography....bad acting and all, but I'm sure it will find an audience. After all, Shakespeare said it best, this kind of exploitation is there to ""Split the ears of the groundlings who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."""
Dreamworks Happy Holidays from Madagascar,,
The Guest,One of the most stylish and fun thrillers of the decade.,"It's a bold statement but I stand by it. This movie had everything I wanted and a hell of a lot more. The plot in a nutshell is that a guy named David (Dan Stevens) goes to the house of a soldier who was KIA and claims to have known him personally, so the family invites him to stay. Then things start happening, secrets come out, and sh*t goes down. Simple premise, and if it sounds familiar it's probably because it's been done many times, but never quite with as much finesse as The Guest.

The writer and director are the same team that brought us You're Next and a few segments from V/H/S and V/H/S/2. Personally I loved You're Next - it was a straight up horror comedy with little to no surprises. Here, the duo hone their strengths into their magnum opus so to speak. The Guest is an action thriller, but there are a lot more elements at work. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's intense, and it gets pretty frightening at times. The scope seems very wide but it all flows together without a hitch, and each emotional reaction keeps your eyes glued to the screen waiting for what happens next.

The Guest is held together by its lead, Dan Stevens. I haven't seen him in anything before this but he was flawless in this role as an enigmatic, seemingly charming family friend. David is immensely likable, even when questionable things start happening you still want to root for the guy. He just has a badass aura around him. Dan Stevens plays him with such conviction that you can't see through him and you have no idea what is going on in his head, but you know that there's more to him than meets the eye.

When I say sh*t goes down in this movie, I mean it. Sh*t. Goes. Down. I won't spoil anything but The Guest has one of the most stylish, suspenseful, colorful, and downright invigorating third acts in a movie I've seen in a while. It's f*cking magnificent. Some people are split on this opinion but honestly, I thought it was an absolute blast. It takes place in a Halloween fun house; as soon as it began I turned into a giddy schoolgirl. Yeah, it's just that much fun. The first two acts are impeccable as well, building up the tension and suspense to a level of tangibility that you can cut with a knife.

The characters surrounding David are all great as well. They're your typical family, and although it may seem like they're just caricatures, they are completely convincing in their roles largely due to the realistic dialogue. Everything progresses believably and exactly how you'd want it to, and the predictability is a strength in this case because it gives the filmmakers a chance to make the simple premise as shiny and creative as possible. I was not bored for a minute of this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal too - it has an '80s thriller vibe and a lot of dark electronic grooves similar to those in You're Next but even better.

The Guest is an action-thriller buff's wet dream, and it even throws in some horror for good measure. It really is one of the most underrated movies of 2014 and an experience that no thriller fan should miss out on."
The Guest,"Darkly comical, ultra-violent and stylish as hell!","Wow! What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.

What follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!

A special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!

Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!"
The Guest,A fun and self-aware thriller; retro without being old fashioned,"I've never watched Downton Abbey, but I'm guessing that Dan Stevens deliberately sought out very different roles after leaving the show. The Guest is the perfect advert for his abilities. He's convincing as the mysterious but charming visitor and equally capable in moments of action, suspense or humour. I hope the right roles come along for him as he's entertaining to watch and has got everything required to become a major star.

The plot unfolds in a fashion that renders a summary both unnecessary and unwanted if you're planning to see this, but after the initial set-up it progresses at a decent pace and with escalating tension.

A special mention is required for the soundtrack. The electronic score is one of the film's major strengths and is perfectly judged.

An entertaining and self-aware mix of action, suspense and dark humour, the Guest has a retro feel without being old fashioned (a quality that is encapsulated by the score), and features decent performances."
The Guest,Very amusing B material,"The only thing surprising in The Guest is just how straight forward it is in its simple plotting. Everything unfolds in predictable fashion, but this B material is a fantastic showcase of wicked humor and misanthropic violence. Dan Stevens is in excellent form here, as a mysterious soldier who shows up unannounced at a family's home of a fallen soldier he served with. He's all smiles and very polite, but people with a usually negative connection with this family start meeting grisly ends. Like in his previous film You're Next, Adam Wingard approaches plotting you've seen a million times and wittily turns it on its ear without ever being too self aware. It's a shame Picturehouse who acquired the US rights dumped the film in a handful of theaters without trying to capitalize on the strong reviews and never bothered to expand it theatrically. The Guest is a quick fun time that knows exactly what it is and delivers without overstaying its welcome."
The Guest,Nice little horror/thriller combo,"THE GUEST is a fun, if derivative, little movie from Adam Wingard, the guy who also brought us the familiar-yet-entertaining YOU'RE NEXT. It's a belated addition to that whole psycho-thriller sub-genre of the 1990s in which ordinary families were menaced by mysterious forces, and it achieves plenty on what is clearly a tight budget.

There are shades of THE TERMINATOR and the BOURNE trilogy here and it has to be said that the story is simplistic and straightforward. The denouement will surprise nobody, for example. However, like DRIVE before it, THE GUEST is all about the execution. It looks cool, it looks stylish, and it sounds cool too thanks to that thumping soundtrack. Dan Stevens is excellent as the suave and sophisticated guy who turns up to make a few waves, and Maika Monroe shows some of the promise that she displayed in IT FOLLOWS. Plus we get Lance Reddick, being exceptionally good again after his turn in JOHN WICK.

In fact, THE GUEST has quite a lot in common with IT FOLLOWS, especially the horror-style unfolding of the plot. These films share likable young cast members and a fresh feel despite the familiarities of the situations in which the characters find themselves. Certainly nothing about THE GUEST is original, yet it's thoroughly entertaining at the same time. And that's all I need from a movie."
The Guest,'80s nostalgia with modern visuals,"It feels almost inaccurate to refer to this movie as The Guest when in reality it was entirely carried by a wonderful performance by Dan Stevens. I enjoyed it thoroughly, which isn't at all to say it's what I would normally call a good movie. The movie is highly campy, reminiscent of '80s-'90s action movies / thrillers, and Dan Stevens brings in an excellent all around tongue in cheek tough 80's anti-hero performance.

Stevens' acting is well matched by strong action that is to the point and not drawn out, as well as superbly chosen music, particularly in the climactic scenes.

For any gamers out there, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for the nostalgia and humor, you'll likely love this movie as much as I did."
The Guest,Well worth the watch even despite some flaws!,"The acting is great, the soundtrack fantastic and the atmosphere the movie creates sucks you in from the very beginning. The movie keeps you guessing throughout at least for the first hour or so. You KNOW something is off but you have no idea what exactly. When I watched it my theory of what was going on changed every 10 minutes :D As the last reviewer stated the first hour is definitely the best part. Unfortunately towards the end the writers kind of dropped the ball. The ending is somewhat unsatisfactorily predictable and the story can only go the way it goes because of absolutely ridiculous mistakes made by some of the characters. I don't know why most movies foam in the endings but I guess in this case it is something that I'm very willing to endure for the fun I had during the first 2/3 of the film.

The acting is awesome for the most part. Dan Stevens does a great job keeping you on the edge the whole time which is utterly entertaining. The writing and dialogue are great except as mentioned above for the somewhat disappointing ending. But all in all this movie stuck with me and though it has been a couple of days since I watched it I still ""feel"" the atmosphere it created (to a great extend due to its unconventional soundtrack, which I eventually bought although it is generally not my kind of music at all). This is a very good movie and I am a little surprised that I basically had to stumble over it by accident and it hasn't gotten more publicity. If the ending had been a little different it could have been fantastic, none the less this way it is still great."
The Guest,Brilliant movie.. worth a watch!,"I went in to the cinema with no expectations with this movie. I watched the trailer and assumed it will be some average movie but I was totally mistaken. The film is very fast paced with surprisingly some humor throughout. There was a lot of gruesome fight scenes (I personally jump watching violent scenes) but I get the reasons why they were there. Dan Stevens was a complete shocker with his performance. If you remember him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! He portrays a brilliant character and he does an amazing American accent. All the actors were perfectly cast for this movie. I loved Maika Monroe, she reminded me a lot of Brittany Murphy and Gwen Stefani. The ending was totally not expected and I loved every bit. The music played reminded me a bit of Drive soundtrack but worked brilliant with this movie. I truly recommend the movie!!"

The Guest,Good Start but Bad finish,"I am mystified by the high score for this movie. It starts off well enough when David shows up at the door of a suburban home and tells mommie dearest that he has just walked from the bus station and is delivering a promise to the family that their son loved them all very much, and Dave is delivering that message from the last moments of his life during combat in the Middle East. Of course, David happened to be his best friend in the military. Mom invites the stranger to stay at the house with her and hubby and teen son and hot blonde daughter. Strange and bad things happen to many people; some with severe violence. The first hour is silly but entertaining, nonetheless. The problem is the last twenty minutes or so where The Guest turns into an episode of the A Team. The acting is TV movie level and the ending pretty much ruins the whole thing."
The Guest,more fun than a barrel of hammers,"An old idea nicely redone with top notch writing and direction.

This is a breakout role for Dan Stevens who manages to commit horrible acts while at the same time being pleasant courteous and generally the kind of guy you'd be happy to have as your friend.

In fact, this is one of those rare movies where the viewer has more fun if you root for the bad guy (so to speak) right from the opening scene.

Hard to find fault with. Even the action scenes are done with the sort of precision you would expect from a martial arts movie.

For perfectionists only -- at 1:17 in the movie, there is an outrageous plot hole. While everyone, including the killer, is going to extremes to keep secret the government project that started this mess, a secret government agent agent suddenly spills the beans to a young girl for no reason at all other than to provide backstory.

Overlook that, and this is a fun flick."
The Guest,Oh Cousin Matthew...,"So a guy who claims to know your dead son turns up at your house one day. He seems nice and looks like that bloke off of Downton so you let him stay for a while... That is pretty much all I knew about this film before I went to see it. What follows is an enjoyable thriller with laughs aplenty and an excellent central performance from Dan Stevens (more on that later).

The plot, at the end of the day, is fairly nonsensical and there are some troubling loose ends that I found a little unsatisfactory. I can't say that any of the story is particularly surprising or original but what does that matter when everyone making it and everyone in the audience seems to be having so much fun? The cinema I was in was probably around half full and while there was nobody in full-on hysterical laughter, there was a satisfactory amount of appreciative chuckling (me included).

I feel that the majority of my enjoyment of this film should really be credited to Dan Stevens in the main role. His character is charming, pleasant and helpful and yet strangely sinister and unsettling from the outset and he plays it absolutely perfectly. You can't help but like him even though you're not sure that you should. Apart from a smallish role in ""The Fifth Estate"", I am only familiar with Stevens from Downton Abbey and his role in this couldn't have been more different from both of these. I look forward to seeing how his career progresses but this was an excellent example of his versatility as an actor.

Overall a good Saturday night out at the cinema but I can't imagine it is the kind of classic film I would watch again and again."

The Guest,Intriguing Thriller,"A young soldier called Dave turns up at the home of the Peterson family whose son has recently been killed in action overseas . Happy to see their late son's friend they invite Dave to stay longer and Dave quickly ingratiates himself in to the family's affection . But is Dave who he says he is and if not what is his agenda ?

!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!

A familiar story , so much so that before seeing it I had it instantly nailed as a rip off from an episode of Brian Clemens THRILLER from the mid 1970s which had the exact same premise . Premise isn't the same as plot however and despite hitting the occasional plot turn with its bedfellows THE GUEST does have an idiosyncratic feel of its own

It's something of a film of two halves . The first half sets up Dave to both the Peterson family and the audience and right away Dave comes across a very likable guy especially when he sorts out some school bullies on behalf of young Luke and much of his likability is down to the way he's played by Dan Stevens and it wasn't until after seeing the film I found out that Stevens is a Brit .Keep an eye on the name Dan Stevens because you might just be hearing a lot more from him in the future . In fact Dave is so likable I did find myself in agreement with Luke that it doesn't really matter who Dave is or what he's done in the past because anyone who can maim a few school bullies can't be all bad

But THE GUEST has to follow a formula which means Dave has to be a bad man and a bad man is indeed what he is so when Anna Peterson contacts the military and Lance Reddick informs every spook in a fifty mile radius to shoot Dave on sight this gives a clue as to how bad he might be . Actually at this point the film might just be making a detour in to the science fiction genre but to be fair it's not as jarring or as leftfield as it could have been .From the outset Dave surprises people around him . He can run from the bus station to the Peterson house surprising Mrs Peterson , he can consume massive amounts of alcohol without getting drunk etc etc which suggests superhuman abilities along with the suggestion he's not human at all which means despite all the familiarity of the story and its flaws ( The ending is a bit over the top ) THE GUEST is a more intriguing film than you might have expected it to be"
The Guest,The Guest brings smooth style and satire in his stay,"Creepy stranger premise has been used in horror or mystery to varied effect, the latest Jennifer Lopez's flick is an example of how not to welcome this premise. Luckily, The Guest has the luxury of having suave lead actor and good atmosphere for a thriller. Some of the kinks are predictable, but the dark humor as well as bizarre revelations offer much needed novelty to the movie.

David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son. He's well-mannered and seems trustworthy, thus the family welcomes him openly. Upon his stay, strange accidents begin to happen, and suspicion arises with the casualties. The most important hook is Dan Stevens' portrayal of David. He looks like a rugged debonair, this is not average smooth, this is Ryan Gosling's level of smoothness.

Stevens delivers a wide variety of emotions, he can be either friendly or deadly. Backed by good cast, such as Maika Monroe as the Anna Peterson and Lance Reddick as Mayor Carver, the movie has a solid degree on acting performance. The exchange of banter is enjoyable, often resulting in manipulation or downright violence for David's benefit. It elevates the human drama between him, the Peterson family and whoever unlucky enough to be in their immediately vicinity.

Mystery of David's real identity is crafted slowly and it's compelling enough to pique interest without revealing too much. The film also has a touch of humor, albeit slightly crude. Strangely, in the third act it changes tone drastically for the climax. This shift is a bit odd considering it plays the thriller aspect with steady pace for the majority of early parts, although this explosive tone does have the merit of being entertaining.

There are short bursts of Hollywood style carnage, but they are modest, not all out gunblazing from the start like Bourne or the recent John Wick. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact.. Good practical effect for the blood and explosion as well as its highly unorthodox soundtracks make the faster pace scenes more satisfying.

Having good mesh of action, mystery and comedy, The Guest is enigmatically fascinating."
The Guest,Just Straight Up Entertaining. Doesn't Try to be More Than it is.,"If you're into these kind of movies, it's one of the best of it's kind in years. Are some of the premise a bit outrageous and unrealistic? Of course, but it never hurts the movie. There's really no unlikeable characters, the few that are are dealt with accordingly. Even the protagonist is likeable and he does some really brutal stuff. My rating did go from a 9 to 7.5 because of the last 1/3 of the movie, which was definitely the weakest part."

The Guest,Great 80s action-horror thriller (that didn't came out in the 80s),"The Guest is a film brought to you by Adem Wingard and Simon Barrett, the director and writer of You're Next and some of the segments of the anthology series V/H/S. Because I haven't seen one of these movies i had no clue what to expect.

In this movie a ""guest"" shows up on the doorstep of a family who lost their son during a war. Because our guest fought with him on the battlefield he is invited to stay with the family for a while. And you might guess it, a lot of weird stuff starts to happen. It's a simple premise and one of my worst plot synopsis' i've written so far but i feel that it wouldn't be right to spoil too much of the story.

I can honestly say that The Guest was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. I saw this movie without even having a clue and it was widely entertaining for a bunch of reasons.

The aspect that differentiates The Guest from similar attempts is its soundtrack and how the filmmakers gave the soundtrack an importance equal to the main characters. It has that gritty 80s feel all over it that sets the tone for this movie from beginning to end.

Dan Stevens as ""the guest"" is fantastic and this role really shows off his range as an actor. He infiltrates this family in every single way and the filmmakers did a really good job of keeping tension and having you wonder for a long time who this guy really is. Much of this is thanks to the performance of Stevens. In a way he's a very likable lead, even when things start to get weird you keep rooting for him. He plays ""the guest"" with so much conviction it's hard to tell what is going on in his mind but one thing is certain, you don't want him in your house for too long.

In conclusion The Guest is a great action-horror hybrid from the 80s that's influenced by it in the best possible way. You can tell that these guys have respect for 80s action-horror but also know how to transcend it in to a good movie with a lot of style and tension build in to it."

The Guest,Worthy Thriller With a little 80's Tribute,"Going in, I expected 2014's ""The Guest"" to be the typical story of a mysterious stranger who turns out to be a psycho. Instead, I got a film that went for something a little different and in the process, paid tribute to the 80's slasher flicks themselves. The story begins when the mysterious but kindly David (Dan Stevens) knocks on the door of Laura Peterson, who just lost her son in the war, and claims to have known and served with him as a former soldier. Soon Laura and her family come to regard David as a member of the family. David seems like the perfect friend, he starts teaching one of the kids, Luke, how to not take crap from anyone and also starts hanging out with the Peterson's daughter, Anna (Maika Monroe), who works at the local diner and hangs out with her friends at parties like many teens do. But of course we the audience know that underneath the charm and ah shucks veneer, there's something to be afraid of and it's not long before several people in town start turning up dead. Who is David? Did he really he know the Petersons' son? And what does a covert military unit want with him?

Part of the fun of ""The Guest"" is where the story ultimately takes us. Without going into too much detail, let me just say David is far more dangerous than your average killer and despite this being a low budget flick, we the audience don't doubt it. Much of this should be attributed to Dan Steven's portrayal of the character. With his charm and good manners, Stevens is able to put you at ease one minute and then make the hair on the back of your neck stand up when we see him stare off at nothing but intensely enough to melt butter whenever he's alone in his room. Plus, he does a pretty good job convincing us he can handle himself in a fight. Maika Monroe plays her part of the hot daughter who has a thing for 80's sounding synth pop and a good sense of suspicion of David admirably as well, as does everyone else in the cast, such as Lance Reddick as the covert military operative sent to take David down. But above all, ""The Guest"" is memorable because we the audience get the sense there's something different here than your average low-budget thriller. One gets a feeling there's some sort of, I guess you could say nostalgic feel to the 80's in the film especially (strangely enough) ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" due to the plot and also the awesome 80's/early 90's sounding synth-pop, dance soundtrack the film has. Plus, the film takes place during Halloween which kind of adds to the film a little bit as well. I can't say it's a perfect film, but for what it is, if you're looking for something that's a little different to kill time with, ""The Guest"" is an awesome thing to do it with. Also starring Brenden Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser and Tabatha Shaun."
The Guest,That guy was smoking hot,I wish he was more careful when made that phone call so Anna didn't get suspicious. His face is just perfect. His beautiful face doesn't allow me to rate anything below 7.

The Guest,Love Dan Stevens,Fun to watch - Dan Stevens is awesome - he played the part perfectly. Great movie if you're not too concerned about taking it too seriously.
The Guest,"The Guest is Wickedly cool, entertaining and doesn't disappoint","I thought I would take a break from cemetery of avant-garde and arthouse cinema, nothing against Apichatpong Weerasethakul, but wanted to sink my teeth into any recent film which oozes of 70s and 80s aesthetics. I stumbled on this stupid title and instantly wanted to check it. I had already seen You're the Next (2011) and quite liked Adam Wingard's performance. I got a small hint about the plot and thought Wingard's gonna sacrifice his white ass for a soldiers family and pull of a Denzel Washington. I was wrong as this film is very laid out with simple plot, crazy climax, with lots of blood, adrenaline that blends sensibilities of classic John Carpenter with some really Giallo aesthetic and a little Nicolas Winding Refn vibe. I don't want to share more about the story or the character arc. But i guarantee this, a feast awaits for those who dig the classic exploitation genre, full of action, with an insanely kickass soundtrack and an atmosphere that will keep you hooked until final credit."

Bad and Crazy,Bad and Crazy is a True Thrill!,Comentario no disponible
Bad and Crazy,Lee dong wook never disappoints,"Liked Squid Game and Strangers from Hell and though oh I could watch a drama with these two where they're enemies, that'd be cool? Well, this drama tricks you. Wi Ha Joon and Lee Dong Wook are presented as enemies in the trailer and the first few episodes but the show quickly develops the relationship into the most beautiful ""brotherhood"". This show made me cry at every corner and made me literally knee-slap-laugh. The action was great and energizing. If this was on Netflix it would've been #1, I'm sure. I loved the female characters, from the ex girlfriend to the villain to the grandmother, all of them were so well written and likable. I loved the entire cast. Lee Dong Wook ofc is a well trusted actor but Wi Ha Joon really shines here as well, which again is impressive when you pit him against such a great actor. So impressed with this show!"
Bad and Crazy,SO GOOD,Now I'm not gonna lie I did watch this purely for Dong wook and hajun but I wasn't expecting anything less since they are both amazing actors. This show is so so so good. It's so funny and so engaging I couldn't stop watching and ended up just binging it in two days. You will not be bored watching this show I guarantee. They balance out seriousness and humour so well that at one point I was so sad and then less that .3 seconds later I was laughing. They even put just the right amount of romance in it but not to much as to take over the whole purpose of the show. It was a satisfying amount. I really enjoyed this show and would highly recommend it to others if you like comedy and crime dramas.
Bad and Crazy,Incredibly Entertaining,"Bad and Crazy was a rare gem of a show that ticked all the right boxes: it blends a serious plot line seamlessly with genuine comedic moments, it's well written, has a great cast, a fun soundtrack, and it has a satisfying ending. The moments between Su Yeol and K are the heart of the show, and its obvious the actors had great chemistry together. The fight scenes are so much fun to watch, they are both well choreographed and realistic looking. The length of episodes was also perfect, nothing was dragged out and the story line was wrapped up in a way that did not feel rushed. I thought the psychological aspect was done well, and while a tad over dramatic at times, it was incredibly entertaining so I give it a pass.

I enjoyed every single episode and would absolutely re-watch this in a heartbeat!"
Bad and Crazy,The two leads make it entertaining,"I was watching this during my beach holiday and really enjoyed the show, especially with the two main cast. The script is moderate, could be better but still enjoyable. Overall acting is quite good. Will look forward to the second season."
Bad and Crazy,Loved Every Actor!,"All the actors were perfectly casted. I could not pick a favorite in this one - Wi Ha Joon, Lee Dong Wook, N, Lim Ki Hong, Cha Si Won - all top notch! Choi Kwang-Je and Sung Ji Ru kept me smiling everytime they came on screen. Han Ji Eun was good, but her character itself felt almost as an after-thought. But, Kim Is Ha really stole the show in her scenes - such good acting from such a little one! Too many other good actors to name, but they were all enjoyable to watch. The script jumped around too much for me. It was fast pace and interesting, but just missing something. The show was a solid 8.5 but I gave it a 9 because1/2 stars are not an option."
Bad and Crazy,I loved this like crazy!,"From the beginning I thought it's like fight club movie. I was a little curious to see. It didn't take long for the story to unfold. You may not get the thrill of sitting down to watch, but every moment will make you think. Yes it's different from fight club movie. I loved the drama and enjoyed it the whole time."
Bad and Crazy,Good Enough,"Korean Drama ""Bad and Crazy"" is a crime action series with strong performances and interesting characters.

The drama starts strong right from the very beginning, with an intriguing crime case and the mysterious K's first appearance. The story progresses smoothly, though the plot didn't maintain the same level of entertainment throughout all of the episodes. Rather, there were some ups and downs, and some scenes that were tiring and far stretched. However, things picked up in the final episodes, with the new main villain being rather sneaky and the twists, which were plenty, offered a lot of suspense. That is when the bromance truly shined.

And for real, the two main characters were the highlight of the drama, along with the well-crafter action scenes. The performances were indeed on point from everyone in the cast, but the main leads were especially enjoyable. The same goes for the OST of the drama which was perfect for the genre of the series and created the perfect atmosphere.

So, overall, seven out of ten."
Bad and Crazy,"As far as a pilot episode goes, it doesn't get any crazier than this!","I've seen my fair share of Korean TV tropes and stories but this show still managed to provide a unique viewing experience.

Actors are perfectly cast and even though the overall corruption/abuse of power theme has been exhaustively explored in Korean TV, I still look forward to the next episodes.

Also, this might be my favorite pilot episode from any TV show ever and I hope the quality remains constant throughout the series. I also like that the Bad and Crazy has 12 episode instead of usual 16 which makes some series longer than necessary."
Bad and Crazy,Could have been better,"Bad and Crazy was not the best series despite some glowing reviews. Despite the fairly interesting crime mystery at its core, the writing, action sequences, elements in the acting and themes were very poorly executed.

The writing started to show its lack of depth at the 6th episode point. The main antagonist(s) were all revealed and the only thing keeping the series going was basically the antics of K and Ryu. There were a lot irrational character decisions seemed to only serve to elongate the run time rather than build on suspense.

There were only a couple of fight scenes that wasn't cringy. Many of the ""minion"" character seem to fall like straws, barely withstanding any punches. The fight choreography felt bland despite some homage to other movies (ie Transporter grease fight scene). Perhaps the fight scenes are meant to be more funny as this series is labelled ""comedy"". Sadly these scenes failed to be comedic or overly impressive. Would have benefitted to take a page out of Jackie Chan movies where the perfect amount of humour is thrown in.

My main gripe with this series is the poor handling of the themes of drug addiction and homelessness. The makeup, costume and portrayal all felt like an afterthought as if they were all just creating in what they perceive what drug addiction/homeless would look like rather than actually doing research.

Lastly, aside from Lee DongWook and Wi Ha-Joon (both of whom are superb in their roles), a lot of the acting of the other actors felt so forced and cringy. Unlike Crash Landing On You where the side characters stole the show, Bad and Crazy's side characters were forgettable and bit dull at times.

Overall, first half of series was fun ride but the latter half was just 1.5x speed glances at screen to see how antagonist gets punished."
Bad and Crazy,Power packed with action and craziness,"Bad and Crazy is an action thriller with a lot of comedy added with suspense as well. Believe me, you will not be bored in this drama due to it's intensity in story and an outstanding techno music to match with it.

With an amazing political corruption plotline, adding with dual personality and drug abuse, Bad and Crazy doesn't leave anything that we cannot be impressed with. The bromance between Lee Dong Wook and Wi Ha Joon was a pleasure to watch, alongside the supporting characters who held this drama and made it power packed. Though some twists and tropes might initially leave viewers feeling muddled, power through them and the pieces slowly start to fall into place, compelling you to sit back, relax and enjoy the wild ride that is Bad and Crazy.

My Rating : 8.5/10."
Bad and Crazy,First 2/3rds is funny and entertaining.,Comentario no disponible
Bad and Crazy,Show runs out of steam completely after (4) episodes,"The first 3-4 episodes were excellent, entertaining and engaging. Then the main plot got resolved and the show could have (and probably should have) ended right there, in 4 episodes.

Instead, it drags on, with a FAR less interesting secondary plot, that feels aimless and was honestly extremely tedious to watch.

I made it half way through episode 7 and realized it had taken me roughly 8 sittings to watch episodes 5-7, constantly feeling checked out. I normally tear through kdramas, binging multiple episodes at once. But this show just didn't need to keep going after episode 4, and it REALLY REALLY drags.

There was also plenty of comedy that fell flat and ridiculously inexplicable character reactions (a main character's first time seeing a man after he murdered her partner in front of her, and hovered over her, deciding whether or not to kill her, as she helplessly looked on in terror, and she's just all nonchalant, like he's some random dude she just met... like what the heck!?)

I tried over and over, but ultimately had to abandon the show part-way through episode 7 (abandoning a show is VERY rare for me).

And from some other reviews, it sounds like it doesn't get any better after that."
Bad and Crazy,"A show that investigates crimes, but also digs into the hearts of heroes",Comentario no disponible
Bad and Crazy,Bad and Crazy and Fantastic!,"First of all, the cast is extraordinary!

Lee Dong-Wook as Ryu Sool-yeol is the protagonist, but accompanied by his hero sidekick, Wi Ha-joon (as K, his alter ego). The two of them create one of the most fun and unusual bromances in film!

But the rest of the cast is just as stellar, with Jung Sung Il as the villain you love to hate, and Kim Hieora as Boss Yoon, the villainess you cheer for, at least at the end.

Han Ji-eun is also great as the super cool detective/ love interest, and it's especially fun when K gets involved.

N (Cha Hak Yeon) is Oh Kyeong-tae, another great performance in the world of detectives.

A really enjoyable watch; I'm hoping for another season!"
Bad and Crazy,AMAZINGLY GOOD!!!!,"The story of 'bad and crazy' is about the detectives who fight against police corruption.. Lee Dong Wook abosulety nailed the performance from start to finish.. Wi Ha Joon, shines in an unusual and different role and does an amazing job.. this K-Drama gets better and better with each episode.. Overall, the story of Bad And Crazy is more well-developed and is way more creative.. it has a psychological perspective, some mind games, it's funny, action-packed, and there's lots of crime/mystery that will have you intrigued until the end.. do watch it..."

Bad and Crazy,Dropped it,"This series got me hooked from the very first episode and I was eating it up. I was so excited about discovering something good. Plus, it is the best that I have seen Lee Dong-wook look so there was that too.

Only I got bored with the repetitiveness around episode three or something like that. It just felt really, really draggy and serving the same thing all over again. The guy getting beaten to a pulp by K, so much so that I actually felt sorry for him. Getting humiliated by the uber-villain and the other guys in the web of corruption. Getting thwarted at every turn. You actually forget that he is a dirty cop himself. I just felt too sorry for him and it was getting too much into misery porn territory, which k-drama seems to love, but it ain't my jam. Not 17 hour long marathons of that crap. In a nutshell it became ridiculous, so I just wanted to drop it at least for a while, but the thing with me is once I take a really long break from a drama I refuse to go back to it. So that's that."
Bad and Crazy,AMAZING!,I absolutely loved this show. The storyline is so cleverly written and the acting feels so genuine and real. The chemistry between the cast members really brought the characters to life. Every episode had me engaged and excited for more; the last few episodes especially had me on the edge of my seat. This is definitely one of my favourite series!
Bad and Crazy,Good and Crazy,"This is an interesting series with much to recommend it. There are times when you know you are watching something of real quality. For example the plotting is satisfyingly labyrinthine and the acting every bit as good as you expect from k drama. In particular, Lee Dong-wook's ability to invest his characters in anything from absolute heroism to total craziness to utter evilness is used to the full. He is always an interesting actor.

Unfortunately there are also less positive facets to note. Because I am not Korean I did struggle with the plot, with constant references to characters by names I did not recognise, which made it very hard to follow what was going on at times. This impacted upon my enjoyment of the labyrinthine plot, whereas this is normally something I particularly value from a Korean thriller.

Also, at times the whole thing seemed completely mad. There was just so much going on, with multiple characters rushing about in different directions, let alone our hero's alter ego, continually popping up out of nowhere.

Nevertheless, I did enjoy it and would even consider watching a second series should it be made."
Bad and Crazy,Fight Club Vigilante,Comentario no disponible
Bad and Crazy,Wow! Craziness and mayhem,"If you are a fan of Lee Dong Wook and think he only acts calm, collected, sexy characters, you have to watch this to see him in a totally different perspective as a smart yet corrupt team leader of a crimes unit in the police force, Sool Yeol! Loved him in this and hope to see him in more such action dramas.

Ja Hoon is amazing as the counter personality K. He is constantly egging on Sool Yeol to break him out of his comfort zone and chase after justice, not simply kow tow to his superiors at work

Interesting perspectives of corruption practices revealed in this drama as well as amazing actors and actresses, heaps of fun and laughter. Kind of reminded me of Will Smith's Bad Boys."
Bad and Crazy,How funny their relationship is,"Today I'm reviewing a series called Bad and Crazy, as promised. I finished watching the episode 12 recently.

I can say this is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Great story, great story, I have no words. Each new episode made me more surprised than the previous one. New things, new plot twists, new reveals. The relationship between Su Yeol and K was magical. Really. At the first sight, Su Yeol was annoyed by him and seemed to be a big problem. As the story goes, they are getting alone more with each other and ending finding out they might not be able to live without each other. Awesome! K was like his brother.

The plot twists were unbelievable. You see something happening in one episode, then changing to something else.

I should mention some scenes were laughable. It kept its humour in it, and I liked.

It was worth it to wait every week for new episode(s).

P. S.: Loved the intro!

I give it 10/10."

Interior Design Masters,Mixed Feeling,The fact that a show like this had only one judge destroyed the show. I think there should be a second judge and the guests should be involved in the decision making. The finalists definitely did NOT deserve to be there.
Interior Design Masters,Potential,"I was hooked to this show until I found a major flaw.The selection of who was eliminated has major flaws.Proof of this was the winner who by herself designed one of the most unpractical, horrible hotel rooms I have ever seen! That is the winner? Seriously? You need more people involve in the decision to better filter through the choices. I did love that each episode did not feel to long or dramatic."

Interior Design Masters,Amateurs or professionals?,"Are the contestants amateurs or professionals (masters)? I'm sure they mentioned them having businesses or already working as interior designers, but one was a restaurant manager and another was a lawyer?

Interior Design Masters,Judge Messed Up,Nicky has more talent. The least the judge could have done was to push both contestants through to episode 7. I picked up a subtle bit of peer-aged jealousy from episode one. It's a shameful classic example of how people in higher positions can misuse their power. I hope Nicky continues pushed forward because her vision HAS classy forward thinking. Elle UK is clearly losing future vision.

Interior Design Masters,"Binge-watched, but...","Wish I could rate higher because this is the show that got me hooked on other interior design shows like Apartment and Great Design Challenge. However, it's impossible to undermine the major flaws of the format: giving absolute power to only one judge and asking contestants to demonstrate their talent and signature styles via chaotic ""teamwork""-based war zones. Perhaps starting with a smaller group of contestants and including more opportunities for sole-masterminded work may have helped with the overall outcome. For accountability purposes, the guest judges should have had voting power."
Interior Design Masters,Maybe British Aesthetics is Different...,"The show was okay. Loved the challenges and different spaces. However, I'm very surprised by who the judges choose as the winner. I personally didn't like any of the solo designs that this designer did-and based on the judges own criteria, this designer didn't stick to design briefs. Very confusing judging and uninspired design by the winner."

The Seven Deadly Sins,Amazing! Just some warnings though.,"I love this show! This is a great show, in my opinion, for teens and adults, not children though. The way the story starts off is very good and the action only increases every episode! I think anyone who likes Magi ,and battle anime in general, would really enjoy watching this. I love the plot and the speed that the story moves, although, like most anime, there are some warnings to heed. My first warning is that if you are uncomfortable watching scenes with perverted (for humor) actions, this may not be a good anime because the main character can be a little perverted towards a somewhat ignorant / naive girl he travels with. Secondly, the main character's other traveling companion, a pig, swears a lot, and seems particularly fond of calling the bad guys profane names. Blood is a regular occurrence, but violence is everywhere and that's why I don't suggest this for kids younger than maybe about 13, depending on how mature they are. Hope this helps!"
The Seven Deadly Sins,"First 3 seasons 10/10, last 2 are 4/10.","Beautiful first 3 seasons, both in cinematics and the progressive evolution of the story, one piece at a time. Character presentation is the best point of the series, together with battle cinematics.

4th season is absolutely to forget, terrible with obscene drawings and pointless developements in the story.

Last season got better with drawings but still levels under the first 3. Storytelling is quite good this time but the ending turnt out to me pretty hurried and banal."
The Seven Deadly Sins,A really fun anime.,"A great and fun action anime. I like the second opening of this season 1. I like the characters, the animation and the action sequences. I suggest 14 and up. If mature enough 12 and up. The English dub is pretty good for the most part. If you like shonen anime, give it a shot."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Epic in the making,"In the ocean of animes, you find only a few gems. Most of them are roughs, but this one is cut.

This series boasts of Yuki Kaji (Eren: Attack on Titan fame) at the helm, with Hiroyuki Sawano (Again Attack on Titan fame) commanding the music and composition with **PERFECT** blend of humor, epic badassery and great emotional quotient while creating an universe with potential of grand scale wars.

I particularly like the main lead who seems the smallest but is actually the strongest with a idealistic mindset, I know, I know it's total shounen, but also shows a gleam of maturity which makes you wonder what he can do when he is angry. Am really waiting for it to see.

Another high point in the series is the interaction between the various Sins till now, they are different from each other like ice and fire, but remain together with a strong both. This makes the lead the most impressive that he can manage such diverse powers and knit them in a group.

Music is top notch as expected which creates the tensions extraordinarily. If at all just listen to the music, it's just awesome.

The pig is another character which serves as the friend and brother of our protagonist (again unusual interactions) and is the great comic element of the show.

I would say just go and watch it. It's fun and has something for everyone.

I would like to give it 9.5/10. But I will give it 10, for it warms my heart with its incredible music and great storyline. **PERFECT**."
The Seven Deadly Sins,"Slow, then fast, then breathtaking","This show starts off pretty slow for a couple of episodes as it sort of staggers when all the main characters start showing up. The show is very good. The music is amazing, and always changes every few episodes, while keeping the same feeling. The characters are extremely memorable, they all are different aspects of the 7 deadly sins, and thus creating very differing and interesting dynamics between the characters. The story, while sometimes admittedly cheesy, is extremely good and has lots of meaning to it. I was severely depressed before watching this show, but this show really portrayed the beauty of life, the grimness, and the silliness all in a perfect balance that really keeps things interesting throughout every single episode. I would highly recommend giving this show a watch, it's truly something special."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Fantastic,"The anime is fantastic, the start is a bit strange at first, but you would love it later. The story is one of the best i have seen. The animation is decent. The thing i love most about it is the characters. Everyone of them is so special and different (especially the Main character). If you want a postitive anime with a great story, awesome fights and adventures, and last but not least funny moments, than thats what you are looking for."
The Seven Deadly Sins,My Absolute Favorite Anime,"Out of all the Anime i have ever watched this is one hundred percent my favorite.I definitely recommend this to everyone and would love to see it get more attention.One reason i recommend this is that the characters are great (especially Ban and Elizabeth).Another reason is that the music is beautiful especially the opening,(Netsujō no Spectrum)i cant stop listening to it. Also i have to say that the animation is great. Lastly i cant not mention the story which has lots of moments which surprise you but they are spaced just so there not to common or rare.So over all this is an amazing anime which i believe deserves a ten out of ten rating."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Loli shounen,"Sate Sate Sate...

A shounen full of loli and explosions.

In the first three seasons, this anime was not too bad. It definitely presented itself as a typical shounen anime. However, many characters had great charms, making the show refreshing enough to be fun. The characters were not bad either, especially the side characters. I liked Ban the most with his touching and sad backstory that I can feel for. Other sinners like Diane and King were pretty good also.

However, about season 4 until the end, the story became messy with mostly crazy strong characters one up each other and explode stuff. Then season 5, the last season came and the series just became silly. The second half of the last season was completely pointless and random. With its big array of characters, many were out of place and should not be in the series in the first place. The most annoying character of all was the pink pig Hawk, with its sole purpose of being useless and screaming throughout.

The animation in an anime usually should not be a detrimental aspect to the judgement of the whole series, but in this instance it is. I cannot take the show seriously as everything looked like kid toys and angry children.

Overall, it was painful watching the later end of the series. Rating of each season: 7/10, 6/10, 7/10, 6/10, 4/10. As a whole, 5.5/10."
The Seven Deadly Sins,awesome,"Incredible, this need a better score !! waiting for 4 season"
The Seven Deadly Sins,"Incredible start, lackluster finish","Signs of a Holy War and Revival of The Commandments were absolutely incredible. I've watched them over again a few times now, and it doesn't get old for me. The first half of Dragon's Judgement was also pretty good, as I am a big fan of Van.

Aside from that the show went pretty downhill. It went from cool fight scenes and a good story to everyone trying to establish that love and friendship is the force that beats all. At some points they actually start discussing relationships during fight scenes, as opposed to showing any actual action. Very disappointing as this was one of my favorite series."

The Seven Deadly Sins,Why season 4-5...?,"The first seasons are awesome. Great characters, nice battles, nice story. Season 4-5 wasnt good, not bad but weird. Beside all that they change the face of Meliodas wtf... For the first 3 seasons the rating is 8."

The Seven Deadly Sins,Great Show!,"~*!Make sure to watch each episode from the very beginning(before the opening song) and also after the ending song! If you skip it or let Netflix auto play you WILL miss content and backstory of the show!!*~ So I saw this on Netflix and a friend watched it and bugged the crap out of me to watch it, so i did. I was not disappointed, it had everything i look for in a ""good/decent"" anime. To start things off one of the main characters is a talking animal which is hilarious, he's one of the best characters from any show not just one of the typical ""animal characters"". If your into the typical shounen animes like ""Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, Hunter x Hunter, One Piece"", etc its a given, you ARE going to enjoy this show. Now to start it off i love the animation and the artwork, the world the show takes place in is beautiful it completely immerses you into that ""fairy tale"" type atmosphere with the forests everywhere and all the mysteries of the world itself. The fight scenes are awesome, completely over powered, over the top fighting. The story is very straight and to the point right from go, and that in a way kind of makes the show feel a little shallow & rushed but it works for it & I still think its one of the better shows. I do wish they would of drug the show out just a little more though, I feel that would of given it more of an emotional bond & room for more details making it not as ""empty?"" feeling(not sure if thats the correct word to describe what i mean but i think you'll understand after watching it). The music is amazing! Both the opening and ending themes are all really enjoyable and can be listened to over and over again and the music & sounds during the show are great and all match well. I love the voice acting for the English dub, I thought they were all great and everyone matched very well. Every single character is great, from the main crew to the side characters they're all fun and a really good cast. At the time of writing this their is currently two OVA episodes which i highly recommend watching if you enjoyed the series as they both shed details to the story that you probably don't want to miss out on & are funny as well.

4/5 Why? Its really funny, definitely one of the funnier shows I've seen lately. The characters are all freaking awesome & cool, if your into completely overpowered, over the top fighting then this show is right up your ally. The animation is great, especially the fight scenes and the artwork of the world itself is some of the most memorable from any show I've seen. Music is great, enjoyable opening and endings, the English dub is amazing i loved it entirely. My only sort of complaint is the story, it's very simple and straight to the point & almost a little rushed making the show feel like ""something"" is missing. But it is just the first season so perhaps with the continuation of the show it will go more in depth. That being said though this is definitely one of the better shows, its hilarious, has awesome fights & abilities, great dub, and awesome memorable characters. Can't wait to see whats in store for the upcoming season!"
The Seven Deadly Sins,Really Great Anime,"Loved watching this one. It had a good mix of fantasy and action. The storyline always kept me entertained. I wish it was longer! I need to find another show to fill it's place.

They do over sexualize some characters, but you will find that in a lot of animes."

The Seven Deadly Sins,The Seven Deadly Sins is deadly good fun.,"I love anime; there's no curve-balling around that argument for me. It's one of Japan's finest contributions to the world of entertainment, and The Seven Deadly Sins is an entertaining albeit derivative piece of that ever-expanding yet established medium.

We have a pretty-boy protagonist, an animal sidekick, a hot-chick, a giant hot-chick, an immortal tough-guy, and a green pig who's as big as a mountain. And considering the oddities in anime, this isn't that odd a thing to have in a show of Deadly Sin's ilk.

There's good animation, good scenery and nice action to top it all off. The characters are well done, though they're not anything groundbreaking for animes in general.

Seven Deadly Sins is a solid watch you should probably check out whenever you like. After all, it is on Netflix. And this is worth an anime fan's time."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Could have been great if the new animation studio actually tried,The series was so great. Then the new animation studo came and they half-assed everything. The distinction is so obvious and it is difficult to look past. It had such great potential
The Seven Deadly Sins,Builds Slowly,"I first tuned into The Seven Deadly Sins a couple months ago, watched maybe 3 episodes and then cast it aside as some sort of weird, overly fluffy cartoon. Couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why Netflix recommended it to me or it came with such a high rating. Then, after having it pop up in some lists a few more times, I decided to sit through one more time. A few more episodes in and I was hooked!

This one didn't win me over from the very start. The heroine starts off a vapid crybaby. The hero is a bit of a perv and painfully optimistic and happy. Plus, he looks like a kid, which make his pervy nature even more disturbing. However, once the action starts, you see the more serious side to these characters and a surprisingly intriguing plot that does not leave you unsatisfied. It's a really interesting blend of Arthurian legend and Dante's Inferno with some glimpses of the same comedic/action/drama pull as FMA. Can't wait for season 2!"
The Seven Deadly Sins,Don't bother after the 3rd season (maybe the 4th),"I loved the show! ...until the last two seasons.

I binged the first three seasons in a week! The animation was great, loved the story and the characters (except the pig).

Season four was OK. Liked some of it, but it wasn't great. But it's WAY BETTER THAN SEASON FIVE!!!

Season five is bad. Really bad. I'm disappointed. The animation by this point is also not good... at all.. I had to skip to the last episode, because it was incredibly boring and I wanted to se how it all ended.

Would recommend the first three seasons, because they are great! Maybe the 4th too. But it was such a waist waiting for the last season.

Would give 8/10, but season five happened..."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Unbeatable Anime in some Aspects for sure.,"One of the BEST Anime + Manga ever watched.

The anime is surprisingly positive, unlike the impression we get from hearing its name for the first time. Even though it starts off slow, it picks up the pace like an exponential curve. This is a must watch whether you are a fan of Shōnen or not. I couldn't stop myself but read the manga on the very day I completed the 1st season. The power- ups are really amazing and carefully thought out for each and every character.

This series boasts off its incredible universe just like Naruto. The story-line gets better and better. The art of story-telling of this series is as good as a story from Oda ( creator of One piece). A well thought story from the very first episode, just like the Harry Potter Universe. The story and its characters are perfect blend of Love, friendship, Dreams, Morals and Trust.

Even though it shows groping/butt-grabbing of the main Characters in the initial episodes, I request you to please be patient. The manga explains all about it eventually. So please don't lose your mind over that. This is all a part of the plot.

Points:

10 points for the animation. Positivity keeps spilling out of the Anime.

10 points for the Characters. I think this is the U.S.P. (Unique selling Point) of the Anime. Every single member the Sins has been given enough backstory. I definitely feel attachment to the characters after one point in time.

9 points for the story-line. Although I would give here 10 points if we were to count in the Manga! Manga fixes the missing links between the past and the present. Still I Can't deny the fact that this anime absolutely takes pride in the amazing story-line!

9 points for the Enjoyment. Though it has its own moments of fun, sometimes you get annoyed over the groping/butt-grabbing. Apart from that, I have sincerely enjoyed the entire Anime.

9.5 overall. It's a thrilling, positive, Action-packed, Full of Mystery and Adventurous Anime.

To summarize, This is an action-mystery-adventure anime which is going to get loads of better in the upcoming Season 2. I'd suggest you to take part in the Sin of giving this anime a shot. Definitely worth it."
The Seven Deadly Sins,Great up until dragons judgement,"The series is comical, it has quite the good humour i wasnt expecting. The story is a bit manic at times but you grow to love it.

My problem is by the 4th series, imperial wrath of gods... youll find yourself overwhelmed by so many characters to keep track of. This is forgivable because you see progression in certain characters which is great to see.

Now dragons judgement.. dont even bother.

I was so disappointed by that series, the lack of care to the story, the animation is so lazy as if they no longer care for their audience. (Like im talking old style freeze frames with minimal movement, which would be fine if it werent for the fact that the rest of the series animation had been perfect) I lost respect for the creators because, yes you made films, yes youve stretched the story out... but you did that.. if your going to create another series it need to be on par with the rest.

And it just wasnt..."
The Seven Deadly Sins,This rating is primarily for season 4,"What's supposed to be a riveting storyline gets muddled with so many character's personal stories that come out of nowhere just to push along an already convoluted story. To add to that the repetitive love professions and Captain monologues by each character gets very tiresome, it's used as a filler and it's very annoying. We get it they all have their connections and it's already defined. No need to dwell on them. Just keep the story moving. Stop wasting time. What started as a good series is just irritating."
The Seven Deadly Sins,A wonderful anime,"If you want to see an anime with great story, great charachters (with good voice-actors) , breathtaking soundtrack, beautiful animations and want to see the concept of all the 7 deadly sins in an anime, this is just the series for you. In my opinion this is by far the best anime i've seen, and oboy have i seen good anime, for exampel dbz, dbs, aot, naruto, fma, fmab and this just beats them all to be honest (especially with the soundtrack)."
The Seven Deadly Sins,"""Ayy, Captain""","It's heartwarming in a sense. They somehow take you from the laptop screen and get you super invested in the story. Every character unfolds, little by little and no matter how ugly it gets, you find yourself indulging in the details and grasping what's happening. At no point, you will be lost or bored. I highly recommend this."

Sex/Life,Just Watch Porn Instead,"Sexually frustrated wife decided to cheat on her husband. Hmmm, where have I seen this? Oh yes, in porn movies. And I've seen porn with better plot.

I think the writer just wanted to have as many sex scene as possible in every episode. Because that's the only selling point here. The story is kind of ridiculous.

I don't get why they try to sell this as a way to empower woman. That independent woman deserve to have their desire met, even though that means they have to cheat on their partner. There are no good reason to cheat on your spouse. This series is glorifying wrong thing.

I feel sorry for the actors and actresses here because they did a good job. But the story is not that worthy. If you just want to watch sex better go watch porn. At least they are entertaining."
Sex/Life,Not as bad as people say,"Shout out to all the straight women who clearly wrote reviews slamming it as it is clear if their spouse had doubts or was thinking about an ex they think the spouse would even tell them about it.... This show isn't bad and it's not the worst either. I've watched the whole season and it holds ones attention. It's not about sex but there are some scenes of it. Wake up those who want to complain about the show and stop replying in reviews about your own lives. Watch this show for what it is: a woman now a mother of two and reflecting back on the biggest relationship before her marriage. It's about choices, relationships, ups and downs, passion, friction in all sense of the word, and losing oneself in the dream (past and present). It could be better in places but you can't find a specific place where the scene should have been changed, edited differently, used other dialogue etc. Just watch it in full and don't stamp your life blinders across it. Watch it for what it is: a story about people."

Sex/Life,A train crash romantic series - I loved it,"I have a thing about train crash romantic stories and particularly like New York ones where I can see places I have been, and I love the ending.

There are so many points where you think ""Don't do that"" you can see it is going to be a disastrously bad thing but people do that in real life too.

I really liked it although the life portrayed couldn't possibly belong to more than 10 people and like Sex in the City I love looking at the scenery and the clothes never mind the relationships and the fun.

Worth the watch, although I told my son more for woman than men, just like Sex in the City. The complexities of relationships and their issues are for me. If it tells you anything about what I like I adore Moonstruck my favourite movie, The Secret Life of Us an Australian series making a comeback, and I am from New Zealand nearly the only place in the world where this could be happening for real."
Sex/Life,The 3 is just for the PG sex,"I am so tired of awful, emotionally abusive men being portrayed as tortured romantics! I can excuse it a bit in teen movies but how a thirty something, trained psychologist would fall for Brad's s#@t is beyond me. Apart from what Cooper witnessed in the gym showers, there is nothing appealing about Brad's overgrown frat boy persona. To be fair though Billie is equally awful so they probably deserve each other. It's like badly written fan fiction for people who are old enough to know better."
Sex/Life,really hot but bad message for couples,"The sex scenes are really hot and steamy but the acting is pretty bad and the story is a terrible message for people who live in a relationship it's kinda look like the series tries to normalize the cheating, although this problem appears in almost every long relationships."
Sex/Life,Worst message for society,Comentario no disponible
Sex/Life,Explores things people are scared of...,"I'm a man and found a lot of dilemmas here I could relate too... So it's not just for women and it's not about empowerment. I see it telling the story of someone who thinks they have everything slowly start to wrestle with ever-growing emotions and desires that are not being met with their partner.

Have you ever wanted what you have to be perfect... But can't help longing for more? This show explores facing these emotions and I felt it was very relatable... Unfortunately.

Do you stick with your 85% or will you never be happy without the other 15%? Is there someone out there that can give you the full 100%? Should you divorce/separate and stay single? Can we ever be completely satisfied?

People are so diverse in how they think and operate and honestly, I wish I was one of the people commenting saying this show is rubbish but it really helped to show I'm not alone and it's hard when you don't feel like you can talk to anyone.

I HOPE there is a second season... They can't leave us hanging like that. We need to see what happens with Billie! I think people are scared to love this show openly but I think there are a lot of people out there dying to see what happens next!

Having these thoughts and desires does NOT make you a bad person. I think it shows you're willing to be completely honest with yourself and that's a scary thing for the world around you because it may not serve them. It threatens to uproot the very foundations of the life you built. It's terrifying!.... It actually can cause quite a bit of torment and I wouldn't be surprised if it's the root or a main reason for many suicides as I have been experiencing this a lot recently. There are other reasons, but this is a large contributing factor...

I'm trying to figure it out like Billie and others out there. Hopefully we all find our happy ending and hopefully without causing too much pain to others in the process.

Remember, if we're not happy with our life, our partner deserves better too. They deserve more than just a shell of ourselves, whether that means a break up happens, or you're able to talk it out and fix things. No one can know what's best for you, except you. Being happy takes courage."
Sex/Life,It's definitely worth a watch!,"I don't understand the bad reviews. It's a good show, it's worth a watch and it takes you back to summer when you was younger with your first fling.

It just ended for a season 2 but if there was a season 2, I don't get where they could go with it."

Sex/Life,Don't listen to the hate.. WATCH IT,"Please don't listen to the low rating reviews and watch the show. I laugh at the reviews where people are saying that it's no wonder people get divorced after watching this (?!) I think it's normal to take a look at your life at one point or another, are you where you want to be? Are the person you're with the right one for you? It's an interesting and complex dilemma a lot of people can relate to (especially if you have someone who ""got away""). It's not about giving up or running away from your responsibilities, but to question; can you really have it all?

It's not 10/10, but I really liked it and binged the whole season. It kept me going back and forth on who I was rooting for.

And for everyone surprised at the amount of sex in this show, it's in the title..."

Sex/Life,A self-indulgent sex fest,"Eight hours tracking and telling the story of a supposedly meaningful and life changing relationship and marriage.... however the characters seem to spend the vast majority of the scenes getting jiggy and having insane orgasms at the touch of a fingertip! Terrible plot and awful characters - especially the main character, who was just insufferable and incredibly fickle. The ending just rubbed salt into the wounds - I watched to the end, desperately hoping for the series to get better later on, but was left sorely disappointed. A self-indulgent sex fest with very little substance. So disappointed!"
Sex/Life,A beautiful fantasy,"Sex/Life isn't meant as an instruction manual for what a woman caught in Billie's dilemma should do. In multiple ways, it's an escape from reality. We know from the first episode what Billie should do if this were real life, but this isn't. They're just characters on a screen.

And my, what lovely characters they are! Unlike so many shows that think they are oh-so-steamy but cover up the actors once they finally get it on, Sex/Life isn't afraid to let us ogle at their beautiful bodies and the things they do with them. Don't be surprised if you get turned on by some of the sex scenes.

The story also sets itself apart by telling itself squarely from Billie's point of view. In the narrator role, she hides nothing from the viewer about her dilemma. By doing so, she makes herself to not just be a sexual object but a sexual subject as well.

If you still feel like judging the show, just ask yourself what your reaction would be if the genders were swapped. If it were Cooper who was bored with Billie and had a sex goddess in his past-now-present. For some people, I'd bet that their reaction would be different, which is why we need shows such as this that push the limits of what we're willing to enjoy."
Sex/Life,Best Sex Of Your Life,"Isn't when you're 40 something with two small children. Strange to think that this wife would believe she'd be swinging from the light fittings or even want to at this stage of her life. But anyway here we have a very emotionally immature woman who fantasies about an ex and all the amazing sec she had with him even though she's moved on, got married and now has two small children. Her husband for a time I feel very sorry for. Clearly his wife and the family are his whole life. But even then when he realises his wife still hasn't grown up he decides to regress to being an adolescent student type. No one seems to behave in an adult manner! These people have children?!

Anyway the sex is unrealistically amazing when they're doing it with everyone they shouldn't be and boring and mundane when it's with each other.

Whilst the show is entertaining enough it really is a bunch of middle aged people behaving really immature."
Sex/Life,Poor,"Absolutely rubbish, repetitive, immature, and I've never hated a main character more. If you want to watch a show that irritates you, this is the one."
Sex/Life,I don´t agree with most of the reviews here...,"It´s a very intense show about all the human aspects we choose to ignore and turn into tabu... I don´t agree with saying that brad is an abusive boyfriend, he really is a person with a lot of unresolved issues that run how lives his life and how he treats other people and Billie, as a psichologist, has a deep urge to try and resolve them for him only to let the love she feels for him blurr the whole situation. Cooper is the nice guy millions of women would want to have thats for sure but once you get to experience the full exciting existence its difficult to settle to a simple suburban soccer mom life... cannot wait for a second season."
Sex/Life,So good till last ~15 mins,"It started with unlike-able behaviours which are actually real, I know some people with similar priorities in life. It discusses real life issues, relation routines, secrets... It went through a pretty rough arc and everything got to their right places till last freaking 15 mins. I was ready to rate it 9, but now I know why everyone is complaining, why the hell did the writers go with such and auful ending? What did the smoke when writing these last minutes. Overal the series is pretty good like I said till last 15 mins, interesting story arc and resolution. If you want to enjoy this skip the last ~15 mins of last episode (you'll know when). Giving it a 6 even the ending is a strong 1.

To give some ideas about what you'll be skipping, imagine building an eiffel tower just to blow it up at the end, that's exactly what happens and it's sad it went this route. But I get it, it was one of possiblities. Don't look for morals if you look till the end.

The show title seems to be an indicative of the plot Sex/Life could be read as Sex or Life (family life), you need to choose one in case of our main protagonist.

Also I think the point writers tried to make, is that some people are just super toxic in our lives. They destroy their lives, our lives and other's lives on their own egoism, instincts, naivity and fake feel of control. They just never change and they can change you into a monster.

Enjoy."

The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,"Great but ditch Bryant, oh sorry I mean Dragon (eyeroll)","If they stopped letting the fool security guard have a damn voice it'd be better but the fact is, he needs to do his job and shut his mouth. Also, what's with the idiotic nickname he's given himself? Dragon? Really? Good lord"
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Great in theory...,"...But not 100% yet. I would love to know what is happening on Skinwalker Ranch, obviously something strange is. Travis Taylor and Erik Bard have the credentials to make a great show and get answers but ""Head of Security"" ""Dragon,"" Bryant Arnold seems out of place, from the way he looks to what he says. He is in every scene, carrying his weapon and makes the show unbearable. Cut the cast in half and try again."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Very entertaining and I'm a believer,"Well I understand the use of theatrics but hello it's television! Scientists and engineers are not generally thought of as bowls of laughs, charismatic and people you want to binge watch. However the fact that I watched 6 episodes in one sitting tells me that I need to get a life...AND it was interesting if not engaging. That's not to say the security guard isn't annoying because he most definitely is. But Travis managed to break down complicated science jargon into things I actually understood and that I found fascinating. It's creepy, interesting and I am a believer in the strange occurrences taking place. And I disagree with others who claim nothing happens. Plenty happens but it is speculation as to what is the source. Hopefully they will eventually get there, but if not, I still consider it a very interesting, educational and engaging show."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Love TT... But...,"I wanted to like this show. Had high hopes. But it is too heavy on the corny. At times the pain of Taylor dealing with the ""team"" especially Dragon are just painful. Show needs to be re-tooled, without the tools."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Secrets Abound!,"Who appointed a security guard as head of a ""scientific"" team?


Did ""Dragon"" give himself that nickname, or is it meant to be ironic, like calling these investigators ""Normal""?


Who wastes their time getting advanced science degrees to work as a paranormal investigator, a job performed by plumbers?"
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,"Lots of intrigue, but you may be disappointed with results","Skinwalker Ranch, owned by Brandon Fugel, definately has some odd things going on.

Mr. Fugel has assembled a small group of highly credentialed team members to apply their area of expertise with the hope of getting some real answers about the place.

It has a long history of anomalous activity; from UFOs to weird things banging on the floor, from the basement, at one of the homesteads housing ranch hands (one of which has a degree in anthropology and has been published).

Radiation is coming from the sky and a very old deep well . We see UFOs. Testing has led to unexplainable injury, but these very smart men set out to test their hypotheses.

There's no shortage of brain power, but we, the audience, hear and see things as though it's being explained to grade school aged children. I wish...more science.

However, like the Curse of Oak Island, much hype and hope leads to little actual results and answers. Just more questions.

Oh....and the man in charge of security goes by the nickname, ""Dragon"". Seriously, he does.

It's interesting and I think I'll watch it all the way to the end."

The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Great Start - Needs more Science less Drama,"Like the show. Came on strong towards the end. My recommendation - less drama and more focus on the science, data, and experimentation. In this situation, there are so many experiments they can do and we see very little of it. I would like to see more background in the data - what does it show? What do you think? If the HC lets this run without constraints, we might learn something here."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Dragon,"My favorite part of the show is the dude who's name is Dragon always telling the astrophysicist what they need to do 😂 Otherwise the show is pretty entertaining it has a bit of ""The Curse of Oak Island"" feel to it. Not sure they will ever figure anything out in regard to what they are searching for but something about the show keeps me coming back! The owner of the ranch I feel like he's the alien in charge of all the things going on the ranch somethings off about him. I don't know what it is but he feels like he could be the evil genius in like a James Bond movie or something like that. I'm keeping an eye on that guy."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,I believe there's something there but....,"I completely agree that there is something going on at skinwalker ranch but this TV show is ridiculous. First take Bryant dragon Arnold and put him at the front gate because he's a security guard he is not going to provide anything at any of the sites. He acts like a punk that wants to hang out with the big boys and when he doesn't get his way he cries like a little baby. The rest of the show is just taking little pieces of investigations and dragging them out for as long as possible. I do feel sorry for the one guy who ended up going to the emergency room with some strange injury to his head, but I'm kind of tired of hearing about it at every episode over and over again. Sadly this show is just that show. By the way if you want to find out what's hanging out a mile above the ranch in the air try using your bosses helicopter instead of spending a whole show talking about firing rockets into the air"
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,"Real Phenomena, Expected Cheese","Finally a show that explores real phenomena. All of the reviews about it's cheesiness are valid (except the phone upside down thing, many many apps right themselves when phone is upside down), and the security team is definitely cringey, no reason ""Dragon"" couldn't afford to use a sling for his AR or Shotty...not sure how he hasn't gotten sick of manually carrying them around the ranch. I believe the scientists are trying to actually capture the real phenomena that occurs there, but the new owner is definitely a little cheesy and the History Channel apparently ONLY knows how to make things extra cheesy. Taking it for what it is tho, it's hands down my favorite History Channel cheese, and covers a REAL mystery that really does beg to be solved or at least better understood."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,When you have some time to waste,"1,6 ghz the frequency that's a red tread in these series. But never ever ever they tried to respond in this bandwidth frequency, in other words a lot of senseless projects involving drones, rockets and above all a lot of opinions based upon less than nothing.. aside that it's easy to watch when you want to clear your mind from the daily bs what's called reality. For the rest this series is rerunning it's own conclusions a lot like it's something new they found... but actually isn't. So in other words, I'd you have some time to waste, this can be a nice show to watch. But if time is a more valuable product in your life, leagevthis series to be valued by someone else.

The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Season 2 needs new editors,"Don't confuse interest of your audience with impatience and poor editing. I am interested in the show and would absolutely watch a season 2 despite the terrible delivery of the show itself. Please stop trying to over-exaggerate simple things and focus on delivering facts. And please, for the love of all mankind, STOP repeating yourself over and over before and after the commercials. Really each episode only had about 12 minutes of real content while everything else was a ""here's what's coming next"" and ""here's what's previously happened"". Just stay the course, deliver facts and messaging ONCE (that's why we have rewind buttons) and stop trying to build suspense for things that aren't anything. I do believe the show has content but it needs a better producer or editor to make this happen. Just make it more serious and not ""reality-show-like"" for season 2 please...."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Intrigued. skinwalker ranch isn't a joke,"This is the first time we can get up to date video access of the ranch, this place isn't a farce. Many would have killed to get to investigate this place for years. I am curious as to the outcome of this show(only one episode has released so far) the other reviewers currently seem to not have knowledge of the site. It isn't some gimmick made up to make a tv show. Do the research on the property, Robert Biggalow would not have been there for years or even bought it in the first place and spent millions of dollars to research the site for years if it was nothing"

The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Great Show,"I am always fascinated by the non-scientific folks who want Hollywood horror in a reality-tv show. The show is entertaining, and brings to light events that actually happened. If this is was so ""fake"", why does the U. S. Govt keep what Bigelow found classified ?"
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,"Interesting premise, not interesting production","Being familiar with Skinwalker Ranch and the assorted phenomena prevalent there, I was really excited about this.

I'm also familiar with the head scientist, Travis Taylor, and his work on television and for the US Government. I had high, high hopes this would be a definitive study of a patch of land that's befuddled people for decades.

There were some interesting points, such as when they brought in several different scientific teams to do their testing. I also found it interesting they discovered the intermittent flashes of microwaves and RF. I had high hopes when this happened.

What bothered me the most was how scripted a great deal of this was, including the ""meetings"" they held to discuss what happened, where do we go from here? SO MUCH DRAMA!

Had this show been permitted to go without all the scripted moments, I think I'd be enjoying it more. What's going on there is already dramatic enough without the production company/History Channel adding more that is setup and scripted.

I'm disappointed purported real scientists, such as Taylor and Jim Sagala allowed this to happen, given they're ""supposed"" to be more science, less folklore or rumor. It makes me wonder just how much ""science"" they actually practice any longer, given they're apparently willing to do whatever a production company wants, so long as they get paid. Their credibility, IMHO, is taking a real hit.

I am, however, looking forward to their ""conclusion"" of what's happening on the ranch."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Get rid of the theatrics,"I want to, just once, see a show about this ranch without ""actors"". This is almost as bad as Mountain Monsters. They try to build suspense with forced reality tv show style conflicts between the characters when the property itself is interesting alone."

The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Give it a chance,There is a liitle bit of overacting for sure...the presentation is not up to the mark...but the contents and the amount of screen time the ranch is given is alright. Lets wait and watch how it gets with the episodes... It may slowly grown on us.
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,No real conclusions,"Every episode had about 10-15 minutes of interesting info. The rest was just slow, drawn out filler. The final episode was merely a review of their experiments and findings while sitting in a board room. Of course their findings have no source figured out. They still have no idea what is going on there. I hope season 2 actually shows us something. I feel like these 8 episodes could've been compacted into 2 or 3. The highlights that I remember are weird lights, a UFO, a helicopter watching them and a young cow died mysteriously. That's it. The cow died from pneumonia that came on from being super stressed out we assume from all of the extra, unexplainable radio waves and microwaves on the property."
The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch,Fascinating Show,"I do agree that this show drags on at times. It's not fast paced. I think it's supposed to emphasize how slowly things move along while doing scientific research. I do not believe this is fake, however. There are real life filmings of UFOs , some strange/unexplained phenomena.....I admit, it does drag on to get to these parts. Perhaps season 2 will be a little faster paced and we get some real answers.....like what is that object underground?! Hey, inquiring minds want to know 😊

Is this show as good as Project Blue Book? Probably not, but it is fascinating just the same. Obviously, there is something going on at the ranch, whether it's paranormal, extraterrestrial, or even our own government experiments .... I hope we find out! I wonder if Dr Hynek ever went to this ranch to investigate anything? I don't recall seeing this in Project Blue Book. Wouldn't it be interesting if he had investigated this ranch? Will we ever learn the truth?"

Soil,"It was enjoyable to watch, but I expected more...","The plot of the story is original, but not that very interesting. My interest of Morrocan and Islamic culture is the reason I watched this. The show has a good combination of comedy and drama, however I expected it had more moments that made me laughing a lot, but it dissapointed me a bit.

The main characters Smile (Yassine Ouaich) and JB (Ward Kerremans) togheter forms a wonderful and bromantic duo. They have the funniest moments. Also Rachid (Saïd Boumazoughe) made me laugh and is a person you can both hate and love. Brahim (Tom Vermeir) has a strong character and interesting story. But some characters were too unfinished and boring.

The story went a little long-winded and the finale episode of season 1 (the only season this moment) was for me the weakest. I want to know how it goes further with the main characters, so I hope there will come a second and hopefully a better season."
Soil,Needs recognition,I am thoroughly enjoying it. Its not a 10/10 for me but its very funny. The main character just makes the most ridiculous and insane decisions but its funny because it comes from the heart of an entreprenurial spirit. He has the heart and drive of a lion but every decision he makes is just like....you already see how its going to unfold and its like watching a train wreck in real time lmfao - solid show you should watch.
Soil,It was a fun watch,"The plot is fun and original but I'm disappointed with the way it was executed.

I saw someone ask about this, the instrument they use in background isn't guitar its called.""Sintir"" or ""Guembri"", the style of music is called Gnawa,"
Soil,Background music,"I liked the background music, I know it is not guitar, trying to figure it out but all efforts went in vain thats whya asking here.does anyone know what instrument they play in the background? And also where can I find it?

Thanks in advance."
Soil,Pretty nice show,"I was very surprised with this Belgian show. A good balance of comedy, drama.

What I really liked is the conflict between an entire community's way of doing things and a young guy trying to bring a change in mentality while facing the pressure of that same community. It shows very well the resistance to a change. Hope there will be a second season."
Soil,"Clever premise gives good vibes, mostly","This original concept is an instant hook to check this show out. There's lots of situational humor here, exploring how this Moroccan family runs their family funereal business within a muslim community in Belgium. Tension between conservative muslim and more westernized traditions sets this up for lots of laughs. It can get a bit heavy-handed in segments, depicting a woman's role and position in both traditions, burial rites, or community expectations. But it turns out that crazy family dynamics, and intimate relationship challenges, are universal truths where ever you come from. There's an endearing code to family-first in this story, that includes more than just blood relations. Would recommend for an easy entertaining diversion."
Soil,"very Belgian, and this is a compliment","Splendid! Poetic, hilarious, funny, surprising, original, daring and yet very recognizable, very Belgian. A beautiful story, told with great feeling. In short: all the superlatives for this series. I am Belgian, not of Moroccan descent, but I have sympathy for just about all the characters in the series. A true top performance, this production. Bravo to the writers, and to Adil, Bilall and Mathieu. All the actors are top notch - I realize it sounds a bit hysterical when I say this - but really, all the actors are top notch. I am just a little more in awe of Ward Kerremans, who plays the role of JB in an inimitable way."
Soil,Overly stressful,"The subject matter of the show was interesting and the acting was all really good but it felt like the writers tried to jam in as many conflicts as possible into every episode. It made it overly stressful and annoying to watch and distracted from the important themes of the show. It could have been much more focused rather than forcing a thousand problems into the plot, all created by the characters' terrible decision making and constant miscommunication. This was a missed opportunity for a show/idea with potential. I eventually watched the whole season but it took a while because I was dreading starting each new stressful episode."
Soil,Entertaining story but is not well told!,"This is one of the better Flemish series to come out of Belgium. Unfortunately, poor editing leads to a lack of continuity and flow in telling the story in a coherent manner. Sometimes, scenes do not follow one another in a continuous manner and this creates gaps in telling the story. In addition, there are too many subplots, some of which start but then appear to be forgotten, leaving the viewer hanging and wondering why the event was introduced or included in the story line.

If there's a second season, it will be difficult to see where the character development would go without the series becoming repetitive and formula driven."

Love on the Spectrum,"If Love on the Spectrum doesn't make you cry, you are dead inside","Love on the Spectrum is what reality TV should be--a way to share what reality is for people experiencing life in a different way. Of course, it is edited, but the creators did a great job balancing the triumphs and heartbreaks and showing us all the little steps along the paths to love that the participants are taking. Very glad to hear there will be another season--each person interviewed shows us a different world view."
Love on the Spectrum,Truly heartwarming,"If you need something to remind you that there is still good in this world, this is the show to watch. At the end I just wanted to hug each and every one of them."
Love on the Spectrum,Fantastic and refreshing,"This 4 part documentary is unexpectedly charming. Each person has a unique story and a completely different way of navigating through dating while being on the spectrum. I laughed, cried, cringed, applauded, and screamed at the tv. It will give you all the feels! Definitely worth the watch. ""Whenever a person is feeling bored or unhappy in their relationship with someone, all they need to do is stop and do one thing that everyone should do: smell the flowers. They don't bloom everyday"" - Michael"
Love on the Spectrum,A lovesong to human courage,"Being on the spectrum and looking for love seems almost identical to not being on the spectrum and looking for love. The main difference seems to be that some people with ASD are more aware of all the challenges you must face when going on dates and therefore prepare more for them. We can all learn something from this.

That's why this series is so moving. You recognize yourself in every situation. The nervousness and awkwardness you feel when you meet someone for the first time; the rules and rituals that make the dates feel a bit strange and unnatural; the difficult task of reading the other person's signals and sorting out your own feelings - we've all been there.

I laughed, cried, cringed, and went aaaww many times while watching this. The people in this series are incredibly brave. It's a privilege to be allowed to follow them in their pursuit of a life partner. They inspire me to face my own fears with more courage.

This is a wonderful series that I'd recommend to anyone."
Love on the Spectrum,Absoloutely Spectacular,"I loved this show. I am on episode 3 right now, but so far I'm really enjoying it. It shows the realism of dating on the spectrum, and if you're neurotypical this gives you a whole different point of view. There were funny moments, cringey moments, and happy moments and I just love the emotion in this show. It shows what dating is, sometimes it's imperfect but it takes a while to hit a gold mine. I hope they make more shows like this, well done."
Love on the Spectrum,Only problem is that there are not enough episodes,This is just a really heartwarming series. It felt like the makers really wanted to help the people participating. Really loved it and shows how unique people on the autism spectrum can be!
Love on the Spectrum,A must see!,"Just do yourself a favor and watch this show! A wonderful and heartwarming show that we can all learn from! Very happy to know that they are doing season 2, i cannot wait! Congratulations to all cast and crew who made this show happen"
Love on the Spectrum,Exceptionally wonderful!,"Better than a 10 to me, I almost wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this series so much! I have Asperger's syndrome disorder I like to use all the variations of it. Such a great documentary show about people on the spectrum; so glad this was recommended to me a few times. I love everything about this unique gem! So heartwarming, inspirational, perfectly awkward, and well made! I've barely had relationships, mostly weird ones and never a proper one with common interests maybe one day."
Love on the Spectrum,Amazing show,"As a mom of 3year old on the spectrum, with my husband who's also on the spectrum, I would definitely recommend this show. I cried many times, mainly when the parents were interviewed. It's not easy to be different in a society that wants everyone to be the same or alike... But people on the spectrum are looked differently when they shouldn't. I hope all of you, in the spectrum or not, find true love and happiness. For parents, it's not easy, I know but everything is easier with love and understanding."
Love on the Spectrum,Makes your Heart HAPPY,"This show is exactly what we all need. Some honest, genuine, heart-warming people trying to find love. My 13 yr old boys & my husband even enjoy this show! I'm so happy to hear there will be a 2nd season because I'm already trying not to watch the first season too fast. My smile was so big watching these people that I would find myself crying alittle cheering them on through their dates. I truly wish I could meet them all & be part of their lives. I wish I could partake in being a part of this show because I feel everyone needs to be more understanding of differences in people."
Love on the Spectrum,Life affirming,This is such a brilliant and heart warming series. All the participants deserve to find the love they're seeking. I found myself rooting for them all and it was such an eye-opening watch and their uncynical view of the world is so refreshing. I especially like Michael whos honesty is at turns hilarious and humbling. Congratulations to all involved in educating people on a very misunderstood condition.
Love on the Spectrum,Mixed review from an autistic woman,"I am autistic like the characters in the show. I liked it for its funny moments and the refreshingly honest and intimate interviews with the participants. However, I have some criticisms - the main one being that they always seemed to match people with other autists. But there are plenty of successful relationships between neurotypical people with autistic people, so it seemed a bit presumptive and condescending to think that the best match for an autistic person is another autistic person. I hope that future episodes are less prescriptive as to whom the participants ""should"" be dating. Personally, I prefer to date neurotypical people because I like to have someone to help me interpret what is happening in social situations. Also, I've had casual sex too, and that is not covered in the show. Not all autistic people are interested in those wholesome ""take it slow"" relationships *all* of the time. Like it is with most people, there is a mix of encounters and emotional/physical needs among neurodivergent folks, perhaps even moreso because autistic people frequently don't feel a need to follow the status quo."
Love on the Spectrum,Whimsical to actual Autistics,"Here's a review from an actual autistic.

Good intentions don't fix a bad execution.

Imagine a world where everyone was autistic, except maybe 1% of the people, and we made a series surrounding just them, called 'dating on the normy spectrum' and then put a whimsical soundtrack under it when they speak or move, every episode.

Sounds belittling? Like a freakshow?

Yep, because that's exactly what it feels like for us when they make a show about us and our condition to entertain others like we're 'so cute'.

And people ask me how I became so cynical.

I wish autistics would just have their own roles in actual series and movies without them being the subject of ridicule or morbid curiosity."
Love on the Spectrum,Best reality series / documentary I've seen on Netflix,"The quest for love is universal and poignantly told through the eyes and hearts of those on the spectrum. Not only do we gain a deeper appreciation of those on the spectrum, but also an understanding of their various hopes and dreams; particularly around love. I watched the series twice over two days and loved it."
Love on the Spectrum,Heartwarming & life affirming,"Just came across this accidentally while browsing on Netflix & put it on as a background watch while online. My husband and I however, had put our phones down within minutes and were totally absorbed in the stories of lovely people with aspergers attempting to find love & their incredible families.

We laughed. We cried. We were totally invested in every story & watched the whole series that evening. It's just wonderful & a perfect antidote to the horrible world out there. Just do yourself a favour & watch it."
Love on the Spectrum,New perspective,"Genuine, and beautiful people looking for love and a future family. Each person in this show has such a positive outlook on life as they search for love.

It's definitely heartwarming to watch them and their loving family. Everyone shows a new perspective."
Love on the Spectrum,A Great Bingewatch,"The thing that struck me most about this show is that dating on the spectrum is not so different from regular dating. We all want to connect with someone, love someone, build a life with someone. And some of us have a harder time than others in making that happen.

I haven't been diagnosed as on the spectrum but I certainly share some of the characteristics of the people featured -- I don't like loud noise, I have trouble with big crowds nearby messing with my concentration, my senses are heightened, I have trouble reading cues from men.

So I was really rooting for everyone. Some of the men featured in this show are the loveliest people, really extraordinary in their kindness. And many of the women are funny and smart. I applaud their willingness to get out there in the dating world."
Love on the Spectrum,A must watch!,Really the Australian continuation of the UKs The Undateables. Truely heart warming and enjoyable for anyone. Restores your faith in humanity. I really hope they are able to make another season once the pandemic blows over.
Love on the Spectrum,"Made me laugh, smile, cry, giggle and feel ""warm""","That is what will happen when you watch this, especially the second season. These are some of the most genuine, honest people ever and the rest of us could learn a thing or two from them about what being truly human is about.

Just a show about love."
Love on the Spectrum,Heartwarming!,"Although very similar in concept to the utterly charming British show ""The Undateables"" this is worth watching because it's so very sweet and eye opening. Everybody needs and deserves love and human connection, it's heartbreaking and also so inspiring to see them try and try and try to find their happy ever after. You will cheer for them and cry for them and wish for another season!"
Love on the Spectrum,I LOVE THISSSS,"Oh man, I fell hard for Michael. He had me hooked the second i saw him. He's so smart and kind and oh any lady that ends up with him would be the luckiest woman on the earth.

Maddi is soooo sweet. She really is funny, I'd love to be her friend!

Anyone who would want to watch a heart warming TV reality show on Netflix should binge this. You wont regret it!"
Love on the Spectrum,cute,"Felt that the same formula was getting a little repetative at the later episodes, but apart from that it was a good show. made me laugh multiple times. has some wholesome moments, but sometimes it felt a little staged and forced.

7/10: ye good"
Love on the Spectrum,"Noble, but forced and unnatural","My wife was totally sucked into this show so I watched a couple of episodes with her. It made me uncomfortable as the producers tried to assimilate the participants into traditional dating conformities.

Why not take a different tack and come up with a way for them to become comfortable with each other on their own level?

If someone is socially uncomfortable and perhaps awkward, it's seems cruel to set them up for failure.

I'm certainly no expert on social norms but it really hurt to see their souls crushed again and again."
Love on the Spectrum,Love on the Spectrum,Wanna laugh? Want to cry? Want to flop over on the couch from belly laughs? This beautiful show will do all that for you!! I LOVE love on the spectrum!!
Love on the Spectrum,I've fallen in love with these people,There may be some valid criticisms about how this show was made. I've decided to ignore them. I don't think the producers are patronizing their subjects. I've fallen in love with all these people and their purity of thought. I've learned so much just about myself and what I can be capable of. Watch this!

The Watcher,Interesting series about material obsession,"I must admit this series did frustrate me at times and also felt like a typical thriller with too many plot twists and turns.

However, what I did find unique embedded in this series is the subject of obsession with materialism and the lengths people will go to to secure and protect those obsessions.

I'm not sure if that was deliberate on the part of the producers to do a series that is part social commentary part thriller but it does work as a suspenseful series that kept this viewer locked in, despite sometimes being frustrated with the obviously dead end twists and turns.

Overall an addictive viewing experience."

The Watcher,An enjoyable series.,"A family move into their dream mansion in New Jersey, and everything seems idyllic, until they start receiving letters from an unknown person, known only as The Watcher.

Based very loosely on some real life events, it's an intriguing mystery series set over seven episodes, it delivers lots of suspense, and plenty of entertainment. Some wonderfully zany characters to enjoy, the neighbours are particularly strange, and essentially it plays out like a whodunnit.

Initially it feels like a horror series, similar style to Bly Manor, but it quickly changes into a more conventional thriller. It may not be for everyone, but I thorough enjoyed it, I liked the vibe, and for the most part, the originality of it.

The final episode will be quite divisive, people will really like it, or really loathe it, it's a little on the vague side.

I thought Booby Cannavale and Naomi Watts were excellent in their respective roles, I did absolutely love Noma Dumezweni, who played Theodora, I thought she was a fascinating character, very well performed.

8/10."

The Watcher,"Enjoyed up till the last episode. Don't watch, save your time.","I knew nothing about The Watcher and was looking to watch something while on the treadmill the other day. At first I was questioning some of the writing and thinking things were a bit hokey, but then I got hooked.

I watched the entire season in one day. I had to to know what was going on and what was going to happen next. I truly was enjoying what I was watching.

So the last episode came on and I was excited to see how the heck they were going to wrap this up and man did they really mess this up. The plot twists were getting to be too much and when it was all over I was like ""Huh? What about this thing and that thing? Why did they bring these things up and not address them any further?

I am disappointed to have spent the day watching six interesting episodes only to have the seventh episode (the last one) be a complete turd.

I would save your time and watch something else."
The Watcher,Braco,"The plot in this series is very good full of deception, conflicts, betrayal, sabotage. This series had my attention from 5 minutes into the first episode, it just kept on grabbing my attention every minute more. It's so full of plot twists that it leaves the viewer wanting more to watch more to answer all the questions that are left unanswered. It's only at episode 5 that some of those questions get answered with certainty one of them is a pretty significant reveal yet still leaves so many more to be answered. The choice of actors, the roles they each played and the exceptional acting produced an easily watched very intriguing series."
The Watcher,Scenes way too dark but great show,"I don't understand why directors think that people want to watch a show where they can't see what's going on. I think the watcher is very interesting and we enjoyed watching it other than it was so frustrating because the scenes were so dark, it was difficult to see what was happening. Typically when shows are filmed like this, we only watch about 15 to 20 minutes and then quit because it's so frustrating with so much lack of lighting to see reasonably. I wish the lighting would've been better and we would've given this full score in rating because we enjoyed the story.

The story was intriguing and caught our attention quickly... Just wish we could've seen what was going on. Do directors ever watch what their end result!?"
The Watcher,"Should be called ""Jumping To Conclusions""","I feel like this show was written by someone who thinks they're a very clever writer. There are constant occurrences of misdirection throughout the show but the issue with this is that, if you just take a couple seconds to actually think about it, you see right though it. It's like the second any information is divulged to the main characters they just automatically run with it instead of taking a step back to use their brain..

...without giving anything away I'll just give a relatable example. Imagine a movie where the main character's parents were killed with a golf club by a man in a red hat. Then 40 years later the main character is golfing and sees someone else on the green in a red hat... so they go up to this person and start bearing them up mercilessly... but the person they're beating up is only like 19 or 20 years old... meaning there's no way in hell they could have been the murderer..

That's what happens in this show over and over and over again. It's like the writer thinks they're being clever by relating one thing to another to misdirect you but entirely lacks the ability to connect the pieces logically.

Nobody in this show has a single ounce of common sense and it gets frustrating so fast and so frequently. Idk imagine someone gets shot and everyone in the area looks in the direction where they thought the bullet was coming from and they just see a baby in a cradle sleeping.. well in reality we can deduce that it 100% was not this sleeping baby that shot someone.. but in this show, all they would think would be, ""man shot. Gunshot come from that direction. Sleeping baby in that direction. Must be sleeping baby. Everyone attack sleeping baby""

Just, not a well-written show at all."
The Watcher,Almost great but then the last episode came...,"After watching the excellent series Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, another creation from the succesful duo Ian Brennan and Ryan Murphy, I was pretty excited to see what they would come up with now. Could it be another great show based on true events? That how it starts though, stating it's based on true events, but after reading about it after watching this show you can only conclude that 90% of it is all made up, and that's honestly a shame and a letdown. I binge watched it though, like I did with Dahmer, and it's only faire to say that it is very watchable. The mystery level is very high, the suspense is mildly high, the acting is very good and that from the whole cast, but the ending is diappointing and that's why this show scores so low compared to Dahmer. But you can watch this show if you like mysteries, and if you like good acting, because with actors like Naomi Watts, Bobby Cannavale, Mia Farrow, Margo Martindale, and Richard Kind, just to name a few, you get quality acting. The Watcher could have been a really good show, they missed an opportunity here, just because of a weak last episode. Since they were making up 90% of the story they should and could have imagined a better end to this short series of seven episodes."

The Watcher,Frustrating true story,"They would have never even have had a story if this family has a dog! Good acting fun watch. I just spent the entire time thinking that no matter how many people could have done this, all the family needed was a good dog! None of any of this would have happened if this were the case. Love all of the actors here. Story was good only somewhat believable. Characters were great. As usual Netflix left us longing for a solid ending. Here are my suggestions.

Any barking dog!

Chihuahua Poodle Any hunting dog!

Labrador Pointer Any herding dog!

Shepherds of any kind.

I find it truly hard to believe that this family never thought about getting a dog! 😂😂😂😂"
The Watcher,Poorly-written. Over-acted. Under-directed.,"I'm a huge fan of Ryan Murphy's productions but this was painfully pitiful. A collection of wonderful actors completely misused. Mia Farrow was the only bright spot in this ludicrous story. There were twists for the sake of twists, and inconsistencies for the sake of inconsistencies. Every character was a caricature and left me wondering why the actors chose to do this. However, if it were advertised as a parody then it wouldn't be so bad. Producers seem to be loosely basing their productions on true stories with hopes of connecting to an audience with the most basic primal need of curiosity. The Watcher was ridiculous and an embarrassment. True, I wasn't obligated to watch the entire series but I continued to hold out hope that the magnificent cast would save this show from itself. Didn't happen."
The Watcher,"Not bad, not excellent.","In tone and content it will, not surprisingly seeing it's the same creators, remind you of ""American horror story"". Also along the lines of ""The Amityville horror"". Not only because it's based on a true story.

It's not bad but not excellent either.

There are some silly situations and things happening that could easily be explained or debunked (not spoiler material: girl, pigtails, camera - sigh, how come they didn't have footage of her actually leaving the bed eventually...)

Good acting all the way through.

But I somehow found myself wondering that this show WANTED TO BE. Chilling or a bit...comedic or both? The tone is shifting quite a lot and I wanted it to lean more towards chilling and scary. I wish it would've been darker."
The Watcher,An incredibly good psycho horror series to binge on,"I'll make it short: I've rarely had as much fun with a series as I had with this one. The acting, the musical accompaniment, the scenery and how the viewer is kept going until the last minute is unbelievably good.

The fact that the story is based on true events ties you even more to the series. You don't get horror in the classic sense, but constant psychological terror.

We watch a family slowly being broken apart by insanity and the drama is conveyed so believably by everyone in the cast. I especially loved Bobby Cannavale in his role.

""The Watcher"" is definitely worth a recommendation and is something to be proud of."
The Watcher,The entire tone of the show just seems off,"Like a untuned piano. That sounds just off, but when played by a good pianist; you still enjoy the sound, but it will still feel like you're missing out on some very good music.

Or that waiter at a restaurant that is too jovial, at your table in a restaurant, in the sense that it feels insincere, and the other waiter who he shares your table service with, who is too stand offish, but he is polite and does everything right etiquette wise. If you look back at your experience at that restaurant, you would rate it as average. Because neither of your hosts got the tone right.

I don't know how to explain it any better. I watched the whole thing with that feeling. Like you cannot put your finger on what is wrong, or not good. It all felt just weird. Off tone. Kind of fun, annoying at the same time, just not as good as it could have been.

The acting is good enough.. with a few exceptions, on the positive and the negative side. But then premise could have been fun, the cinematography is up to par, but every episode has lines or actions in the script will just make you go: ""wow that is just not.. realistic enough to be either believable or entertaining.""

In the end I felt like I watched something completely irrelevant. But why did I keep watching? Maybe because it is that average, not bad enough to not watch it till the ""end.""

Maybe I was hoping all the good factors would lead to a gripping or surprising conclusion. Even that felt like; okido.. that was just; not satisfying or the opposite.. it was really just: nothing much.

And duh, with that cast, you want to root for it to be really good. Maybe that is what kept me watching.

It's not good, not that bad. Not that scary, not exactly boring. There are a lot of really good things you can watch instead. In hindsight I think I wasted a few hours on something that I could have rated either a 5 or a 6. Gave it a 6, but maybe that is to justify my watching it till the end.

My recommendation would be to just skip it."
The Watcher,A Good Hook That Led Nowhere,"When I first started watching, I was hooked. It was clear that this was going to be an interesting story and it caught and peaked my interest even more because I intentionally did not read up about the true story prior to watching.

It was good for the first few episodes but then it started to get sloppy. Every single person seemed like a potential suspect and certain pieces of information was just left unsolved. Too many plot holes. It began to feel like I was on a merry-go-round that was never going to lead anywhere. The show just became frantic with no clear direction, which ultimately spoiled it for me. I watched until the end to see if it became better, but it didn't. It was an ok watch but i wouldn't watch it again. A little disappointing."
The Watcher,Excellent,I don't understand the negative reviews. Why? The show keeps you glued to your seat the entire series. It is an exciting series with great acting. What were people looking for? It keeps you guessing the entire thriller. Show starts out kind of on a Pacific Heights limb. Crazy insane neighbors. All it matters is the show is exciting. What is the issue here I have no idea. The show deserves at least ninety percent on rotten tomatoes. Show has a great mystery to it and it most certainly isn't predictable by any means. Grumpy people. Go watch it. Deserves a good rating at least versus excellent. Worth it.

The Watcher,"More well-acted, expensively-produced, terribly-written Ryan Murphy trash","Seems like Ryan Murphy realized after the last, oh, 5 or 6 out of the 10 seasons of ""American Horror Story"" that people were hip to the title and knew not to bother watching, so he started releasing seasonal ""miniseries"" without the AHS brand but essentially the same thing: well acted, well-produced, contrived, trashily written garbage, with ""twists"" you can see coming a mile off and absurd contrived characters whose overwrought behavior stretches the bounds of credulity. I was actually about 5 episodes into this, scratching my head about how something with such a talented cast could be such an unredeemable pile of soap-opera garbage in terms of plot, when I finally noticed Murphy's name in the credits.

Please, Ryan Murphy, go back to calling the new seasons ""American Horror Story"" so we know from the outset not to bother hoping for better."

FIFA Uncovered,Psychopathic Blabbering Blatter,"You know you're dealing with a psychopath Blatter when he could smirk at every horrible event/deed - even if he's not personally involved in it, the nonchalance is chilling. And if he isn't, and he wasn't aware of any wrongdoings, the fact that things were happening right under his nose and he's ignorant of them all makes you question what kind of a leader he was.

And ""I like the question"" + smirk when asked about abuses and deaths of foreign workers in Qatar. Goodness. ICYMI, this is the same guy who's reported to have ambitions to win the Nobel Peace Prize via FIFA.

Perhaps what needs more probing is our unquestioning psyche. There are many corrupted and immoral institutions in the world, FIFA is hardly the only one, yet most of us keep letting it recur, turn a blind eye as long as we could consume something nice. Worse, once we sense that we could benefit from a corruption, we will potentially turn to the dark side in the blink of an eye. But I think as long as money is regarded as the only thing of true value in most societies, I'm not optimistic anything will ever change."
FIFA Uncovered,"As the World Cup looms, this documentary shines through","As a lifelong fan of football, or soccer as it's known elsewhere, you often have to remember that the sport is a very quickly changing industry. From a result one week to a newspaper headline the next day. Within all this mayhem, it's easy to forget what has happened and what is most likely still going on in one way or another.

FIFA Uncovered is a reminder of how disgusting and immoral these absolute pigs were/are. The absolute front of Blatter to sit there and be interviewed smiling during this documentary is shocking. The man deserves prison and this documentary shines upon that.

RIP to the workers in Qatar."
FIFA Uncovered,Stop teasing short people...,"Because you will end up with repugnant narcissists with Napoleon Complex like Sepp Blatter. The man is clearly insecure about his height, having brought it up on two occasions unprompted in the first episode alone and lying about his actual height (he says he is 5'7"" but he is arguably only around 5'3""). Imagine letting yourself be tormented by a lack of height your entire life regardless of wealth and status. While his contribution to this documentary was useful in portraying just how delusional and self-serving he is, much of it was not relevant to illustrating the corruption happening under his presidency within FIFA.

The FIFA story is just an example of what is happening across the world in companies, corporations, governments and countries. Corruption is inevitable when you have unsound people, who are narcissistic, psychopathic or Machiavellian, pulling the strings at the top. They are the ones who are ambitious and unscrupulous, displacing their good-natured and righteous opponents. The unsuspecting public are also often swayed by their empty promises and false image. To mitigate corruption, first know the enemy and stop giving them a clear path to unfettered power."
FIFA Uncovered,No Surprise,"This documentary has dropped unfortunately too late for any effect on the upcoming, completely rigged World Cup in Qatar. This oil-rich country, who had no international football team when the ""decision"" was made is an absolute joke of a country. Completely sports-washed and voted for by a bunch of old men looking for a last ditch payday. Their lack of anything notable in sports, let alone football is STILL not even the main story, but their lack of human rights and terrible working conditions that have resulted in deaths of some people IS. These Arab princes should just stay away from the beautiful game and concentrate on their own issues. Stop trying to barge in to a market where you're not wanted. No wonder EA Sports have dropped the name FIFA from its own branding next year. They've definitely known this documentary was coming and want nothing to do with them."
FIFA Uncovered,Profiteering Off Ball Dreams,"As we watch FIFA football/soccer games, and even play video games almost every day, the dirty corruption behind the scenes is deeper and more widespread than we thought.

In 4 episodes, this documentary offers a few glimpses: FIFA's blind eye to dictators exploiting the sport, exploitation of players, buying votes for chairman/location elections, exploitation of workers from developing countries... it's all very infuriating. By the 4th episode, you can't help but feel only a small bit of justice has been dealt.

There are lingering questions, however. The documentary seems to uncover the tip of the iceberg. But how were other World Cup locations decided, besides Russia and Qatar? Were the culprits limited to CONCAFA? (can't be) No famous players wanted to contribute to the documentary? So there are limitations to this documentary, and understandly so since corruption is usually very hush hush.

Still, it's a good wake up call that organizations with loads of money, unchecked power, and easily exploited representatives from poorer developing countries make for good corruption (and probably not limited to FIFA)"
FIFA Uncovered,"The beautiful game, run by a corrupt institution.","This is a fascinating watch, ahead of The Qatar world cup in 2022, this four part series details how it happened, how we've gone from Russia, to Qatar.

Such a fascinating watch, whether you love football or not, this really is worth a few hours of your time. Fascinating interviews and insight, the amount of times you'll hear the words...'FIFA is not corrupt,' said with a straight face and no blushing.

The first word that comes to mind when you think of FIFA, corruption, we've all known for many years that the institution is a rotten, corrupt organisation, one which has served to line certain pockets. Credit to those that went after those that thought they were beyond reproach.

Money makes the world go round, that saying could well be applicable for those at FIFA. The organisation is rotten to its core, it seemed that many of those involved were heavily into corruption, blatant levels of it. It is actually sickening to watch. You can't help but feel bad for those that were in place for the love of the game, what must they have thought watching events unfolding over that last few years.

If like I do, you love football, you are going to watch the world cup, all I ask is that you spare a moment to think of those that died building the infrastructure in Qatar.

Where next, you have to wonder, will it be to whoever is willing to pay the biggest price. North Korea maybe?

Startling, 9/10."
FIFA Uncovered,"Good, but nothing more than propaganda","Corruption is everywhere, specially in such a big organisation like FIFA which doesn't have a ""referee, time limit and boundaries off the field"". We all know about it but don't talk about it. We don't need to look past the last 10 years to understand what this show is trying hard to convey. The conditions of the workers who did an absolute fantastic job with setting up the infrastructure in Qatar were horrendous. But does that really mean we shouldn't expand the reach of this beautiful game to lesser known lands? Questions are asked as to why one of the world's greatest sports event should be hosted in a ""desert country"". Enough with this labelling please. Football is much more than the country it's played in, it's a way of life, a culture that unifies an otherwise divided world. A game with a player and fan base as diverse as football should be played in many many more countries other than those of Europe and North/South America. Yes, money may have been thrown around to win world cup hosting bids. But no money in the world can keep the world cup from moving to other lesser known countries in the future.

The series is well done with good substance. It does a good job of pointing out specific people who are directly involved in this farce. But let me end with a question. If this world cup was hosted in any western country this year instead of a ""desert country"" in the ""middle-east"", would this series still see light of day?"
FIFA Uncovered,Get Ready to Get Angry,"This is a must see documentary even if you are not a futbol fan. Oh how greed can corrupt absolutely should be the subtitle for this film. Based on the book, ""Red Card"", it follows the evolution of FIFA from a non-for-profit steward of the world's beautiful game to a commercialized, money grabbing, pocket lining sham of an organization. It's top leadership, more interested in their own personal gain than helping to develop soccer in underdeveloped countries like Africa and Asia (one of its stated missions). This documentary helps to blow the lid off the deepest crevices of FiFA's illegal tactics.

More importantly, this documentary leaves the viewer with a broader lesson than just the corruption of FIFA. It explores ""sports washing"" - when authoritarian regimes with serious human rights abuses host large sporting events in hopes of cleaning up their image. From the Munich Olympics in 1936, hosted by Hitler to Russia and now Qatar hosting the World Cup sports lovers need to recognize how sports are being manipulated for political and economic gain. Qatar bought off FIFA so they could host - a country where women, LGBTQ, and minorities are treated like second class citizens. You will want to boycott this World Cup after watching FIFA Uncovered."
FIFA Uncovered,USA vs FIFA,"We've been tracking a corruption operation that has spanned two generations, with the entire organization, including former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, being implicated. The extent of corruption within regional and national federations remains uncertain. However, the ironic twist lies in the World Cup relocating to Qatar from the USA. It appears as if the USA is exacting revenge... Had the 2022 World Cup been held in the USA, it's likely that this documentary wouldn't have garnered as much attention, highlighting the intricate interplay between geopolitics and sports corruption on a global scale..."
FIFA Uncovered,Serve Qatar the damn red card!!,"Such a powerful and intense show based on facts and bringing all perspectives to the story. Really gets me angry as a fan who loved FIFA World Cup since 2006 Germany hosted one. Sad state of affairs without any transparency for such premium org of biggest sporting event on planet. With less than 2 weeks to Qatari world cup kills the notion of a tiny Asian nation capable enough to showcase event built on top of bloodshed of 5000+ innocent lives mostly from Indian, Nepalese migrant workers and how abused weak section of labor class are in front of rich arrogant barbarian sheiks sitting at their high table on oil wealth and showing absolute zero dignity to human lives. Disgrace that such high moral European and US teams aren't man enough to boycott this event and call out the Qatar murderers who blatantly ignore it."
FIFA Uncovered,This is just an intro!,"It is definitely a good watch for people who have no to little idea about whats going on in FIFA; however, there is much more to corruption and fraud of this institution that you will need to search for more!

More content should be available regarding fraud of agents in football. Watching this please do not think everything about FIFA is revealed. The reason for most of the drop in football and clubs needing more sponsorship, apart from unqualified executives, the money agents get through transfers and the overwaged players they represent. Once the players get more money than they should it is inevitable they dont play to entertain the spectators or for the sake of their country but only for the money!"
FIFA Uncovered,Sportswashing and Qatar.... This Documentary Will Explain it All Rather Carefully!,"Perhaps if FIFA had paid strict adherence to its very own Rules and Parameters, more likely than not, this Documentary, FIFA UNCOVERED, would never have been produced and distributed!

First, let us focus on the The Title's content and context:

There must be at least a handful of You asking Yourselves.... And Exactly what does FIFA stand for? Well, let me offer my help. F. I. F. A. Stands for the name of the International Organization responsible for governing and supervising all International Soccer Football matches around the World! Since the original name is not in Engish, but in French, I invite You to look it up! It should only take 10 or 15 seconds, if knowing its original name is really that important to You! UNCOVERED explains carefully the origins and history of FIFA and exactly why its name is in French.

If I have now piqued Your interest, here is some great News for You: UNCOVERED will fill You in on the particulars of Sportswashing and its relation to QATAR very nicely... In a way that is guaranteed to quickly have You craving more! There is most definitrly no other Sport in the world that can compare to Football. (Need I remind You that outside of the USA and Canada, FOOTBALL means only one thing: Soccer Football.)

Immediately, upon seeing the Title: FIFA UNCOVERED, many friends have mentioned dropping what they were doing and beginning to watch! Considering that this Review, hopefully, will post just a couple days before the Qatar World Cup Final Match.,,Timely... Certainly seems to be the operative word in this case!

UNCOVERED clearly demonstrates the very highest production values in Documentary Filmmaking. It is a film that checks all the boxes. Watch and You will probably agree ""Entertaining"" should probably top the list. May I have the ENVELOPE Please!... FIFA UNCOVERED! Kept me mesmerized from opening frame to end credits. Even if You are not a huge Football or Sports fan... You will find it most enjoyable... Here, I am trying my very best to exlain exactly why!

Let me offer a clear example to substaniate the claim made above: When the subject matter of a Documentary is composed of events that occurred many years in the past... Quality Editing is absoluetly indispensable. Kudos to KEVIN KONAK! His Film Editing clearly demonstrates an uncanny sense of timing that keeps the viewer on the edge of their chair throughout the entire film! IMPECCABLE! I think would be my word of choice!

Since much of what is depicted on screen occurred 30 to 60 years ago, of course, old film clips, were often juxtapositioned with scenes that were produced very recently. These were all photographed in a way in which said contrasts in time were not in the least annoying nor unpleasant, as is so often the case. My hat is off to You, MICHAEL TIMNEY, for your truly Superb Cinemaphotography.

As regards the writing of the Narration dialog, Semantics and Tone should be absolutely spot on. Again, UNCOVERED hits the BullsEye in this category! So, let us give credit where credit is due. MILES COLEMAN...Exquisite is a term that seems to fit nicely!

Here is a Documentary that has something for everyone! From the diehard lifelong Football Fanatics who have watched several matches per week for decades, to the individual who has never watched any sporting event, of any kind. And just why would I say this? You are perhaps asking Yourself at this very moment. Well, UNCOVERED has been produced in a most thorough and meticulous way. It takes a very methodical approach to International Football, going back to its origins and emphasizing its longtime sportsmanlike amateur roots.

Sadly enough, however, the world of FIFA Football began its total implosion in 1974. Yes, it is now nearly 50 years ago that the mountains of cash being generated by International Football ascended into the Stratosphere! UNCOVERED does make one extremely key point absolutely crystal clear. That despite the cesspool FIFA began morphing into around the mid-Seventies, probably 99% of worldwide fans basically turned a blind eye. As long as the FIFA World Cup was carefully organized, scheduled and all of its games broadcast in practically every country in the world, it seemed that practically the entire world was composed of Happy Campers! The behind the scenes sordid corruption pervasive at the highest echelons of FIFA, was really nothing over which most Fans ever lost any sleep!

Soccer FOOTBALL had a squeaky clean image in my mind, until viewing FIFA UNCOVERED a few days ago! WOW! Talk about a Wake-Up Call! There are 2 things that I hope will happen as a direct result of this Documentary:

1) Many Millions of Football Fans around the world will be lucky enough to see it! And..... 2) All of us consummate fans can figure out something we can do to change a lot of the disgraceful goings on!

Some of the participants in FIFA World Cup games and activities undoubtedly have had at least some idea that there are, and have been, one Hell of a lot of very sleazy activities in which the Directors of FIFA have been involved, but which have been simply shrugged off as.... Well, where BILLION$ of Dollar$ are involved and Dozens of Countries partcipate and benefit handsomely... STUFF HAPPENS!

There are 2 important omissions in UNCOVERED. One which You might deem most appropriate: Although Mr. Josepp Blatter most certainly enriiched himself immensely owing to his position and involvement with FIFA... There is never any attempt to put an exact dollar figure on the total monetary benefit he received. Kudos for that Documentary Discretion!

The second omission must be chalked up as pehaps the only major shortcoming in the film itself. There should have been much more emphasis on the tremendous importance of the consistently augmenting presence of Both the USA, the largest market in the World for Sporting Events and in the lives of many Milllions of Americans throughout the past 1/2 Century!

Any Review of UNCOVERED would be incomplete without a standing ovation to the man who so masterfully blrnded a plethora of diverse elemnts together in his finished product, Director DANIEL GORDON. Your inspired Documentary truly speaks for itself!

Even if You are one of the minority who has very little or Zero interest in Football, I am sure that because of its importance to Billions of others on the Planet, You will realize the very special signifcance of the focus of this Documentary and appreciate its approach, tone and overall even-handness in tackling a subject (No Pun intended) which is near and dear to the heart of so many hundreds of millions of inhabitants here on Earth!!

So, no matter what Your personal opinion or realtion with Soccer Fotball happens to be, I am absoluetly convinced You will find UNCOVERED to be well worth every minute spent enjoying it!"
FIFA Uncovered,Blatter off the hook...,Comentario no disponible
FIFA Uncovered,Really great documentary - b.hurt arabs decrease the final rating,"Overall a great investigation and giving the mic to Blatter too was a genius move. He really shows how corrupt he was. FIFA is a mess and Qatar world cup's great final will not wash this fact or the fact that Qatar illegally bought this cup away.

FIFA needs to get better but this documentary shows the situation is even more dire than it was shown on TVs.

What this really deserves is at least 8 but bu.hurt arabs are spamming 1 or 2s into this title like crazy. It is obvious that Qatar does not like it when people talk about how corrupt they are or how their country was an awful choice for the world cup."
FIFA Uncovered,"Informative, but did not go deep enough","Very informative documentary about corruption in FIFA at least since the election of Havelange for its president in 1974, until 2022, the year of Qatar World Cup. There are precious stories and so important characters that I did not knew and have been extremely influential in FIFA business: Jack Warner, Chuck Blazer, Mohammed bin Hammam, Horst Dassler (the son of Adidas Nazi founder)... Not only the data and footage, but also the testimonies by some of them are very nice (I also highlight testimonies by Joseph Blatter and by Hassan Al-Thawadi, secretary general of Qatar 2022).

There are, however, very serious flaws in the documentary, that counterbalance its aforementioned qualities. The very beginning of its first of four segements is terrible, with cheesy edition and too obvious narration and testimonies.

The film improves afterwards, but the alternation of good and bad testimonies would be a trait until the end. What irritated me the most was that correct criticism about some of FIFA's choices and procedures are mixed with a lot of prejudice by some interviewees. A straight example: off course Qatar has been chosen by being rich, there is a strong suspection of bribes behind that selection, workers in the World Cup infrastructure had awful conditions and no labour rights (indeed, FIFA has been worsening laws in all host countries in the last decades, what is not discussed in the documentary) and Qatar has no tradition in football (differently, for example, from Saudi Arabia or Iran).

Saying that is not the same of defending that Qatar could not be the host because the United States were candidates, because the weather is too warm, or because it is too expensive for European spectators to go. That is ridiculous! It is fair that an Arabian and Middle East country be the host for the first time. Qatar, the owner of Paris Saint Germain, is certainly not the best option, but the region deserved to host, and Asian spectators could eventually attend the match in great numbers. So, the documentary mixes good information and correct criticism with prejudice and Eurocentrism.

The correct criticism against Argentine military dictatorship in 1978 and interesting comparison do Nazi Olympic Games in 1936 were directed to criticize Putin's Russia hosting the world cup in 2018. Well, it not only deviates from noticing that Qatar is even more authoritarian, but also that the alliance with dictatorships is a longstanting tradition of FIFA, that predates Havelange and Blatter: 1934 World Cup was held in Fascist Italy under Mussolini and squadra azzurra has been world champions playing at home just like Argentina would be in 1978. From 1921 to 1954, FIFA president was no one less than acclaimed Jules Rimet.

Another serious problem in the documentary, in my critical opinion, is that it fails to connect the dots: indeed, FIFA way is a corrupt one, and from 1974 on, with Adidas, International Sport and Leisure (ISL), Coca-Cola and so forth, money increased a lot and football became a big business it had not been before, when FIFA was still amateur. However, you cannot understand that avoiding the key word: ""capitalism"".

Havelange and Blatter stablished together with Horst Dassler leading FIFA as a big business not simply because they had a plan, but because of transformations in world capitalism (welfare state in Europe was also shrinking, for example). A conservative aristocrat with a mind linked to racist British colonial times such as Stanley Rous could not maintain hs position as FIFA presient simply because he would be a constraint for capitalism, which needed modernization represented by Havelange and his partners.

FIFA aims profit and not the development of football throughout the globe and even less that everybody be able to watch the matches. That means more inequality, disrespect for laboutr rights, disrespect for the countries' sovereignty, unnecessary stadium building or reform, empty seats in world cup matches. That is not just because Havelange, of Sith master Sepp Blatter, or Platini, or Valcke, or Infantino have interest on it. They are engines of a greater machine called capitalism. Sport is just an excuse. There is precisely why there are powerful men inside FIFA from countries with no football tradition such as Cayman Islands, Qatar... Just follow the money."
FIFA Uncovered,a freekick...,"On mr blatters anckle, is a pretty subordinate comment on this netflix production of fifa, its a lowgrade historic biopic of the organisation, and as a primetime product, its all over negative on the subject of everything about fifa management since early 1980's.

So for everyone who hates footbal as its played today, here is my change of rules to make footbal more remarkable and seeworthy, if not to say even more fair per share, so let the grumpy old mans drum start rollin...

¤1 effective playtime, stop being fooled by players doing pingpong and hauling time on own pitchhalf, and extratime given that isnt proportional with the true lenght of time used.stop the clock when the ball is outta play, it might lead to cleaner games and shows the difference of loosers and the fittest of the game

#2 use the whole team in every match where substitution of players could commence all the time, like in icehockey, fresher players gives better quality allround.

#3 the card rules are stupendously stupid, noone cares anyway and the players get slaughtered anyway. So quit them stupid cards with real punishmentthat may harm the team as a collective, yellow card should in my opinion be granted with 10 minutes on the sideline, leaving the team with 9 fieldplayers, with 3 yellowcard within 10 minutes, well then just 7 teamplayer at the pitch, and that would be like rubbing salt into the sore legs or hips or groins whatever. A red card should be apointed 20 minutes penalty on the sideline and every red should lead to a heavy fine going to a fund that should offer help to every football club outside the league system

¤4 when the attacking team push the football over the centerline of the pitch, the ball cannot be passed back over the line as a defensive draw.if that happens the ball shall be overtaqken by the other team automatically.offensive football is fun and seeworthy,and there are plenty space to roll the ball over there on the other side.

So nothing new here in this series for the scrutinizingly curious supporter. An 8 for the try."
FIFA Uncovered,The sport we love is still being led by corruption,"Netflix certainly know how to handle a true crime documentary as this is certainly what this story is. There were no surprises in this series. I cannot see how this was continuing for so long and in such a public manner. All of the people involved including Sepp Blatter should have been indited on any counts of corruption as that was plain to see.

So much of the series had outside details from the organization but hear Sepp Blatters interview during this series made my blood boil since there is no remorse regarding his actions and everyone can plainly see that he was the head of all of this during his reign of Fifa. Bringing all of these people into the light was only the beginning and the same as how Making of a Murderer helped save an innocent man i truly hope this is able to bring down the corrupted leaders of these football federations."
FIFA Uncovered,"""Uncovered""","Just think about this: if USA and GB got organisation instead od Russia and Qatar, would Sepp still be seating in his chair? I think so. Uncle Sam thought that they just need to apply for organisation of World cup, and corrupted FIFA should give it to them. Do you really mean that Bil Clinton came to represent USA because he loves his country?! And there is no $$ in that story? And FIFA rules ""one country - one vote"" is so ridiculous. Fifa should be terminated as organisation. Infantino just took plce instead of Sepp. It's so obvious. Football is so corupted. And once back then, it was a truly magnificient game that is ruined by money, greed, coruption and everything else."
FIFA Uncovered,If you love football you should watch this,"Football it's a fantastic game, no doubts about it, but when it comes corrupt, specially by the institution that as the obligation to protect it, the results are devastating and you can see it clearly in this documentary.

Very well structured and will show with a lot of quality this bad reallity about football and open your eyes to another kind of game, that is not played in the field but in the circle of those who have the power to decide the future of the game.

Bring the commentary of Joseph Blatter and another persons directly envolved with FIFA and these scandals, increased even more my interest to know the feelings of these people and their really motivations and justifications. But they are true?"
FIFA Uncovered,The Dark Side of the FIFA,"I'm not a football fan. I watched football for 10 years or so, but then I got bored. Now I only watch very important matches, tournament final matches. Sometime. . . That's why I didn't know the side of football from the field, frankly, I wasn't even curious. But I did not think that the authorities there had very powerful authorities. Everything was different. The facts have come to light. Who knows what else happened. But in the beginning, nonprofits organisations end up doing everything they can to make money later on and become more than what they represent. Don't forget what the religions are actually ? Yes, FIFA is more than just football. They lost value in people's eyes. Yes, after that, bribery won't it? . . . I absolutely don't believe it. Until the end of bribery in the world, it will continue everywhere, and frankly, I don't think it will end. Yes, the other side of football from the field is also interesting. I liked this documentary. I watched it in one sitting. But there is something I can't understand. Why only Qatar ? Not much was said about Russia. Why is that ?

By the way, it's Football, not Soccer :))"
FIFA Uncovered,History of every capitalist company,"You could literally replace the word FIFA with the name of any other capitalist company and this documentary would still be relevant and make sense. It seems like the guests invited to speak are somehow surprised that an international multi billion dollar company has people at the top that are corrupted.

This documentary seems more like a money grab due to it being realeased just before the world cup and the USA seemed more pissed they didn't get to host the world cup and make money, rather than them really caring about FIFA and ridding it of corruption. During some moments I feel they are trying to push this agenda of wrongdoing but I could say the same thing about this documentary, being released just before the world cup in order to get views.

Other than that, in a way, the scandal of 2015 had to be covered so I guess there's that."
FIFA Uncovered,"Incredibly biased, with an agenda behind it.","The corruption is clear, but the agenda and the bias are also clear... this show basically says: NOOOOO THE BAD GUYS CANNOT HOST FOOTBALL, IT CAN ONLY BE THE GOOD GUYS!!!!! And wow what a coincidence now they're hosting it in the US... the country that fought the most wars in recent decades.

""You cannot host football in a country that doesn't promote LGBTQ+""....""Accept everyone and their culture"" how are these statements not contradictory?

""Human rights for workers!!!"" Before crying about that, go check who assembles your phone, hyprocrite.

When you visit a country, you need to respect the people and their culture.

Netflix is a propaganda machine, wake up."
FIFA Uncovered,This need not be a 4-episode series,"The stuff that is covers in this foot part docuseries could've been covers in one 90 minute movie. So basically it's forcefully drawn out. And also, they don't tell how exactly were the frauds caught. They just say this guy snitched and it led to arrest of these guys. But hot though? And they also don't tell why Blatter reminded unharmed by the prosecution.

All in all it's a good story but it is too long. Takes too long get to the point. And sometimes it just jumps from one point to another like a slideshow. If you really want to know what happens at FIFA, this is a good series. But a Wikipedia page on that is just as good."
FIFA Uncovered,Include facts of corruption but shows the Europeans like angels,"Documentary about blaming platter was good and fair but protective about European and american morals and interests, Iam sure alot people also talked behind the cameras about the hosting countries of the past but nothing from it came into that documentary. What about the Germans 2006 with the shocking money's they ...... . Where did the money of the Germans go? Oh to Qatar that time right? That time Qatar was good enough for give German ... To the hands of the fifa. After that south Africa and the rest??? But keep going with the mindset witch the media gives u guys that Qatar is the pure evil, Qatar isn't the only evil in the world guys and specially with the boosted support of another sick community today witch hates Islamic mentality and religion and ethics at alI, guesses who i mean? (LG......). Everyone blames the first Arab country in history or let's say ""Muslim"" Country at all for the first time who got the right to host that Event and talk about america and england deserve it more? But no one is telling you guys the truth that america and england already hosted it in the past so is that fair? I am sorry to say that. You guys haven't realized the real big player and evils who show themselves as the helpers of humanity and stab you in the back..."
FIFA Uncovered,Where is the investigation regarding US and Western countries?,"This documentary is biased and only investigates how third world countries have won the right to host the world cup and linking them to corruption.

How about western countries? Who the won it? US 2026? Germany 2006?

Or the FIFA only corrupt when its related to countries other than western nations!!

If you want to really investigate FIFA, then you should start from the beginning as European countries are the highest beneficiaries from FIFA. They hosted the highest number of world cups despite when they only make less than 10% of the world population! Any investigation on why the FIFA treated countries outside of Europe badly? No because it doesn't go with the narrative.."
Next Gen,My God this series is great!,"I love this series so much. I like the characters, how they interact with each other and just the plot alone. This is pure genius. Going on adventures with the crew and having a bit of humor along the way. The acting is supreme and the soundtrack is nice too. I ❤ this series very much and can only recommend it !"
Next Gen,To boldly go where no one has gone before.,"Nearly twenty years after the original Star Trek was cancelled by NBC, Gene Roddenberry and Paramount sought to capitalize on the enormous success of TOS in syndication and on the big screen. Roddenberry decided to make the new series with few connections to the original, so that it could stand on its own. Many fans didn't like the idea of new characters, but Roddenberry pressed ahead, and Star Trek: The Next Generation was born. British stage actor Patrick Stewart assumed the role of Frenchman Captain Jean-Luc Picard, bringing gravitas, phenomenal acting skills, and an English accent that would become the boon of many jokes; Jonathon Frakes became William T. Riker, the Kirk-esque ""Number One"" with a love for the ladies and jazz; Brent Spiner was cast as Data, the android who envied human emotion; Gates McFadden was Dr. Beverly Crusher, the CMO with a complicated past with Captain Picard; Wil Wheaton was her irritating son Wesley, who would long annoy the fans; Michael Dorn brought a distinct presence to the recurring role of Klingon officer Worf, so much that he was promoted to regular. Marina Sirtis looked good as Deanna Troi, the psychiatrist who had once been involved with Riker; LeVar Burton was cast as Geordi LaForge, the blind Conn Officer; finally, Denise Crosby was Security Chief Tasha Yar. Also in the pilot was an unnamed conn officer played by Colm Meaney, who would later become Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien.

The first two seasons were of average quality, but they did a good job of setting up the characters and expanding the Trek universe. The series gathered its own following, although it continued to exist in the shadow of TOS. Q became an ongoing presence, appearing twice more after the pilot. His third appearance had him introducing the crew to the Borg, the fearsome cyborgs who would become Trek's most famous villains. Denise Crosby left TNG near the end of the first year, saying that her character wasn't being given enough to do. The producers also removed Gates McFadden's Dr. Crusher, introducing Dr. Kate Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) to induce more conflict. The fans did not take to Pulaski, so McFadden was brought back for the start of Season Three. That season was when TNG really came into its own, ending with the reappearance of the Borg. The Borg abducted Captain Picard, and turned him into one of them; Riker, now in command, gave the order to destroy the Borg Cube, while Picard was still onboard. That was the greatest cliffhanger in TV history, and TNG received a great deal of media attention as a result. Droves of new viewers tuned in for the fourth season premiere, which many perceived as a bit of a letdown after all the hype; but the viewers stayed, and TNG soared in the ratings, producing more and more quality episodes. While it did lose a bit of steam in its final year, it finished with an incredible series finale, All Good Things..., and then launched a movie franchise of its own.

TNG Top Ten Episodes: Conundrum; The Next Phase; Data's Day; The Best of Both World Parts I & II; Redemption Parts I & II; Reunion; The Defector; Face of the Enemy; The Pegasus; Elementary, My Dear Data;"
Next Gen,Best series EVER!!!!,I love TNG so much. All the characters are superb and Captain Picard is the best Captain ever. My favourite episode is always have been The Inner Light. 10/10.
Next Gen,A wonderful series,"This is an interesting, thought provoking, and most of all entertaining series. Gene Roddenberry not only gave us a ""Wagon Train to the Stars,"" but he gave us interesting stories reflecting the great values our society holds as truths. I know that ""some"" episodes were not that good, but that can be said of any series that has a long history. For the most part this program exceeds the mark of excellence in writing and entertainment. The delivery of the writing by Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner et. al. truly brought the Star Trek future to life. The casting of this program is wonderful!

I would hope that anyone with the desire for interesting intelligent science fiction would find this program enjoyable. If a person today is ONLY seeking an action packed thrill ride, then perhaps they may not find the value in Star Trek. But I have loved the program from the first day I watched Captain Kirk in ""The Man Trap"" from 1966. Since then I have watched the development of Trek with an open mind. I believe that ST-TNG to be the best incarnation of all Trek programs, to date.

In this day and age of terrorism, and threats of war, it would be nice if we could apply more of the philosophies from the possible future of this series. Maybe if more people watched this program the world would be a nicer place!?!"
Next Gen,Trek in the 24th Century...,"When the TNG series premiered in 1987, it wasn't greeted well by many of the old-time Trek fans, including myself. It didn't help matters that one of the earliest episodes, ""The Naked Now"" was a superficial retread of the classic ""The Naked Time"" from '66. The new episode should have served as a way of spotlighting several of the new crew, but all it did was show them all in heat. I wasn't too impressed. What did work was keeping the central theme of exploration (something lost in the offshoots, DS9 & Voyager). The new Enterprise was twice as large as the original, with about a thousand personnel aboard. Capt. Picard (Stewart) was a more cerebral, diplomatic version of the ultimate explorer we had known as Capt. Kirk. Again, Picard wasn't too impressive in the first two awkward seasons, as some may mistake his caution for weakness. The Kirk-like first officer Riker (Frakes) was controlled by Picard, so the entire crew of Enterprise-D came across as a bit too civilized, too complacent for their own good. It's interesting that this complacency was fractured by the most memorable episode of the first two years, ""Q Who?"" which introduced The Borg. All of a sudden, exploration was not a routine venture.

Other memorable episodes of the first 2 years: the double-length pilot, introducing Q; ""Conspiracy""-an early invasion thriller; ""Where No One Has Gone Before""-an ultimate attempt to define the exploring theme; ""The Big Goodbye""-the first lengthy exploration of the new holodeck concept; ""Datalore""-intro of Data's evil twin; ""Skin of Evil""-death of Tasha Yar; ""11001001""-perhaps the best holodeck story; and ""The Measure of a Man""-placing an android on trial. Except for ""Q Who"" the 2nd year was even more of a letdown from the first. Space started to percolate in the 3rd season. I liked ""The Survivors""-introducing an entity resembling Q in a depressed mood, and ""Deja Q"" with both Q & Guinan squaring off, as well as other alien beings. A remaining drawback was the 'techno-babble' hindering many scripts, an aspect which made them less exciting than the stories of the original series. As Roddenberry himself believed, when characters spoke this way, it did not come across as naturalistic, except maybe when it was Data (Spiner), the android. The engineer La Forge (Burton), for example, was usually saddled with long, dull explanatory dialog for the audience.

In the 3rd year, truly innovative concepts such as the far-out parallel-universe adventure ""Yesterday's Enterprise"" began to take hold, topped by the season-ender ""The Best of Both Worlds,part 1"" in which The Borg returned in their first try at assimilating Earth. After this and the 2nd part, the TNG show was off and running, at full warp speed. There are too many great episodes from the next 4 seasons to list here, but I tended to appreciate the wild, cosmic concept stories best: ""Parallels""(s7); ""Cause and Effect""(s5); ""Timescape""(s6); ""Tapestry""(s6); and the scary ""Frame of Mind"", ""Schisms"" and ""Genesis."" There's also the mind-blowing ""Inner Light""(s5), ""Conundrum"" and ""Ship in a Bottle""(s6), ""Second Chances."" The intense 2-parter ""Chain of Command"" was almost like a film, and the great return of Scotty in ""Relics"" was very entertaining, though it showed you can't go home again. The show also continued to tackle uneasy social issues, as in ""The Host"", ""The Outcast"", ""First Contact"" and ""The Drumhead"" as well as political:""Darmok"", ""Rightful Heir"", ""Face of the Enemy"" and ""The Pegasus."" The series ended on a strong note, ""All Good Things..."" a double-length spectacular with nearly the budget of a feature film. But it wasn't really the end. A few months later, an actual feature film was released ""Star Trek Generations""(94). It's rather ironic that the TNG films couldn't match the innovation and creativity of the last 4 seasons of the series. ""Star Trek Insurrection""(98) for example, is a lesser effort than any of the episodes mentioned above."
Next Gen,The Best Trek Has to Offer,"In an early episode, Captain Picard delivers a line from Hamlet: ""What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an Angel! in apprehension how like a god!"" But he delivers it with conviction instead of irony, and by doing so creates the thesis of the entire franchise.

Star Trek was never meant to be a realistic depiction of what the future will be like; rather, it's an optimistic argument for what the future could be like. Our heroes on the new Starship Enterprise are noble and rational, and the writing is more concerned with ethics than with punch-ups. Fans of Captain Kirk's red-blooded man of action might be disappointed, but then this is a more mature version of Star Trek. As we mature, we realize there are better ways to solve our problems than with violence. Patrick Stewart's Shakespearean captain is a renaissance man, capable of using the right words and unexpected actions to overcome obstacles, and he needs neither a hairpiece nor a fight scene to prove his character.

The show's other standout star is the android Data, Spock's opposite yet kindred spirit. Where Spock repressed his emotions and was disdainful of illogical humans, Data is curious about our foibles and aspires to be more like us. That implies that being human is not a curse, but something wonderful and virtuous.

There are no space wars in The Next Generation, and for a good reason: creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that by the 24th century war would be a thing of the past. The interpersonal conflicts and domestic dramas of other shows are here replaced by adventure and exploration. Human nature doesn't have to be absolute: people can change, and humanity can grow and evolve. Star Trek: The Next Generation is seven seasons of optimistic, outward-looking space adventure for people who believe that the human race doesn't need to be defined by the villains it faces, but by its own innate spirit."
Next Gen,marvelous!,"This series is a true marvel! I don't recall seeing any other series so diverse in its thematology, so rich in ideas. Patrick Stewart really adds a lot of depth to his role, throughout the series there are references to drama, literature, science that make some episodes a true journey through beautiful ideas. Also, the plot is sometimes very good, despite the scientific discrepancies one often encounters, or the effects that might at some points appear outdated. This is science fiction that aims to elucidate the eternal human questions, not just give a dramatized prospect of human evolution. Data is a unique character, his interaction with the captain (and the rest of the crew) is uniquely enjoyable, often giving insights into the evolution of human ethics, as for example in an episode where Captain Piccard is called to support the view that Data is a conscious life form and thus has the right to decide for his own fate; that he cannot be considered as property, even though he is a human construct. You really never know where the next episode will take you...from MacBeth to Cyrano, or from Data's love affair to the first contact with the crystaline entity, or Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Truly, I have never seen any other series with such a broad range of ideas and references. I wish to thank all those who made it possible, and Patrick Stewart for adding such a dramatic depth to his role. Truly, in no other case has an actor in TV done such a great job at combining so diverse elements in a single character, and with so superb acting...Patrick Stewart really carries you away with his acting, it is epic to say the least. I remember him in so many roles, never did he disappoint me.

Its a magnificent work of art, one that stretches across many marvels of the human intellect to create its beautiful and educating (in the Greek sense, as actors become teachers of life through their dilemmas and adventures) drama."

Next Gen,Science fiction at his finest,"I've watched this in 2019 and at the beginning i was sceptical because it felt so dated and cheesy but man i'm glad i've endured season 1 because what i got was really smart and well written science fiction and not the explosion action filled one we get nowdays. This show is about the ethical and moral dilemma of future civilization exploring space. While some episode are clearly filler they are still really watchable thanks to the amazing cast of characters you end up caring about, even secondary ones i really didn't like i ended up caring and rooting for them. The good episodes on the other hand are really some of the best television i've ever seen, they put the crew in really thought provoking situations with most of the time a satisfying ending. I really reccomend this show to anyone that is even a little bit interested in science fiction and if you are scared by the colossal lenght of this show since it's basically a collection of adventures the enterprise goes through you can also watch the best rated episodes even though i reccomend watching the whole show."
Next Gen,Love it can't get enough.,"Grew up watching this show and the characters feel like family. Of course you have a weird or bad epp once in a while but for a whole it is just awesome. The science fiction is believable, the music is awesome, acting is spot on, really makes one's imagination wonder."
Next Gen,The Best Star Trek series,"Following the success of the Star Trek movies in the mid 1980s, the producers decided to put ST back on the small screen with a shiny new Enterprise a new crew and a whole host of new species worlds and enemies. The first season and the majority of the second season are a bit shaky but from the third season it picks up massively. Patrick Stewart is now the captain, a more cerebral, diplomatic captain and played wonderfully. This series introduced far more relationships between the crew (Troi and Riker, Worf and his son, Crusher and Picard) which play out beautifully over the course of the series. The Special effects considering their now nearly 15-20 years old still look good and the Enterprise D is a true flagship vessel.

There's so many good episodes it's kind of hard to pick out anymore than the main standouts most people have mentioned already, Yesterday's Enterprise, The Best of Both Worlds, The Inner Light are probably the most popular but everything, certainly post seasons one and two provides good solid sci fi."
Next Gen,The most inspiring TV show ever made,"Star Trek: The Next Generation is not just a TV show. It is a philosophy. TNG resembles the very best of Sciencie-Fiction tackling our everyday problems and beyond with a clear vision and moral compass. Gene Roddenberry was a true visionary and his ideas for a bright and positive future of mankind live on in this show. This vision is presented to you via great writing, brilliant acting, beautiful sets and effects (for its time) and an iconic soundtrack from grandmaster Jerry Goldsmith himself. They simply don't make shows like this anymore."
Next Gen,Not the best not the worst,I'm a huge Trekkie. I think this series did a great job of creating the universe but didn't run with it as well as movies like First Contact did. Definitely ds9 trumps this in terms of entertainment value
Next Gen,"Great for its time, not so great now","In my teens I was fanatical about the show. The possibilities, the dreams, the inspiration. We had Star Trek nights, Star Trek arguments, Start Trek groups. Yes, I was a big fan.

So over twenty years later, I sat down to binge watch this show again. Twenty years ago I would have rated this an easy 10, now it is a generous 5.

My biggest disappointments are

1. What is their mission? The opening credits clearly state ""...To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations..."". But in nearly every episode they are encountering a human colony, or within a few hours of a star base, or near the border of the neutral zone, or they are intercepting a shuttle craft. Apart from the three times they were flung to the far reaches of the Universe by The Traveller or Q, they never left Federation space. An Earth based analogy would be... ""They have left the city and are now driving around the suburbs, with the occasional foray into the rural countryside"". How are they exploring strange new worlds in their own backyard? Little imagination by the writers.

2. The writers really did have a poor imagination of future life. All technology on the show looks clumsy, awkward and clunky. Really, did none of the writers or set designers consider slimline, sleek, holographic computer displays, flexible screens, screens with dynamic displays instead of the silly stenciled screens we see every episode, etc...

3. The awards... Have you seen some of these awards? ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design"", ""Outstanding Individual Achievement in Editing "" and ""Outstanding Hairstyling for a Series"". Seriously?? This reminds me of awards being handed out to children in an event, even when they come last. Feel good awards.

4. Characters were flat and poorly written but the standout performances of the regular cast were definitely Data and Captain Picard

5. Worf who was supposed to be some powerful security officer, but had his butt kicked in every single fighting scene, except two.

6. Deanna Troi who had the annoying ability to state the obvious, but had no ability to use her powers when they were most needed. For a councilor she is over emotional and prone to fits of hysteria. Not the stability one would expect of a ships councilor. And to surpass her co-workers to become equal second highest rank on the ship was too much of a stretch to be taken seriously.

7. Star Trek TOS of the 1960's seems to have set the technology standard for this show. Amazing that 30 years after TOS and the writers of TNG could not come up with anything unique, rather they were just extensions of the existing technology.

Unfortunately, this has gone from memories of a great show with some bad episodes, to a very mediocre show with the rare good episode. It will be a show I never re-watch."
Next Gen,Greatest Sci-Fi series of its time,"People that watch science fiction seem to forget that Star Trek: The Next Generation was filmed from 1987 to 1994, and that it accomplished the breakthrough technical wizardry we now see in other sci-fi movies and television shows.

It was Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) that accomplished the ""orange screen"", reducing by 2/3 the cost of shooting space sequences. It was STTNG that finally allowed for a very advanced and yet BELIEVABLE ""evolved"" human behavior involved in space travel.

I admired Captain Jean-Luc Picard for his reserved Brit style, and the tension between him and Dr. Beverly Crusher. Who did not like watching Lieutenant Commander Data and Lieutenant Geordi LaForge spar over human behavior? What about the short brilliant life of Lieutenant Natasha Yar? Who didn't tune in to see that? Commander William Riker was amazing to watch, as he grew a beard and a conscience -- while still being able to keep up with the great Lieutenant Worf, the only Klingon (as yet) in Star Fleet!?

Those of you out there trying still to wage the Star Wars - Star Trek battle for supremacy -- grow up! They are both inspiring stories in different universes."
Next Gen,"Extraordinary show with brilliant cast, clever stories and lots of fun...a real adventure through the universe.","What a great show. Really takes the original to another level, both visually and intellectually. Sticks to the original recipe of Stand alone episodes, full of adventure with a great cast. I can't believe this is now over 30 years old. Will not disappoint."
Next Gen,"The best TV show ever made, and by a very long margin.",Even after decades this is still the best TV show ever made. Roddenberry's vision for the future of humanity serves as an outstanding everlasting inspiration. And the show is enjoyable and has so many facets and layers so even after watching it for the 10th time it always gives something new and deep to think about.
Next Gen,"Beyond doubt, STNG was exceptionally good!","In fact, Star Trek Next Generation (STNG) was & continues to be IMHO, the very best Star Trek series since the original Kirk / Spock series.

I Genuinely believe that STNG, Unlike Star Trek Discovery, Picard, and Star Trek Strange new worlds, was / is far better, due to the fact that it stuck firmly to the original writing and ideas of the great Gene Roddenberry!.

Yes, it is true to say that STNG did suffer somewhat script wise, after Roddenberry's death.

That said, generally speaking the script writers did return to the Roddenberry original Next Generation format.

Actors such as Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean- Luc Picard), Levar Burton (Geordi Laforge), Marina Sirtis ( Deanna Troi), Michael Dorn ( Lt. Worf), Gates Mc Fadden ( Dr. Beverly Crusher) Colm Meaney ( Miles O' Brien) and the ever annoying Jonathan Frakes ( Lusty Cmdr Riker), Brent Spiner (Lt. Cmdr Data) and Wil Wheaton (Wesley Crusher).

Brought together some exceptionally great actors, some more annoying and some who, like Colm Meaney and Michael Dorn were given far less good lines, than their skill set and characters actually deserved.

Despite this, Star Trek next generation was generally well scripted, with only few exceptions to the rule.

Nevertheless, over all STNG was and even in 2022, continues to be watched by Trekkies and holds a very important place in the hearts of fans!.

It is considered to be the ONLY genuine Star Trek series which comes close to the original series!.

All in all, a very deserving 9 out of 10 for Star Trek Next Generation the series.

A final Thank You!, to one actor who is sadly very often overlooked, when it comes to admiration of STNG acting skills.

I therefore mention Majel Barret, as without her wonderful voice STNG would NOT have been such a great experience. Majel was the voice actor, who voiced the vessel computer and her unmistakable voice is constantly heard throughout 104 episodes.

Sadly, Majel passed away in 2008 at the age of 76.

She had multiple Star Trek-related roles, though she is mostly remembered for her roles as Nurse Christine Chapel in ""Star Trek: The Original Series"" (1966-1969), as Lwaxana Troi ( Mother to Deanna Troi) in ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (1987-1994) and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine"" (1993-1999)."
Next Gen,What a great show,"I have been hooked on this show ever since I rented a couple of episodes on video over 10 years ago. The series was shown on Norwegian Television, but they stopped it at the end of the forth season. I then bought the whole series, one season after another on DVD. I watched all the episodes, and I realized how great this show is. Over the course of the series, the characters deepen and it gets to be more and more interesting. There is the mishap of the second season, but although it was the worst season, it did have some very good episodes, like 'The Measure of a Man' and 'Q Who?'. I have seen this show now five times from start to finish (and I think that will be seeing much more), but I have found that the episodes which are much action oriented, like the double episode 'Chain of Command', was quite boring. I love episodes like 'Darmok', 'The Inner Light', 'Disaster', 'The Nth Degree', 'First Contact' and 'Who Watches The Watchers?' where the crew meet new races or find themselves in a situation that they are not used to.

This is a series that can be appealing to people who like to see action in their science fiction and people who like to see, meet and know new races in their science fiction. This was a fantastic show."
Next Gen,The best script and interpretation of the entire Star Trek franchise,Comentario no disponible
Next Gen,Taken me by surprise,As a late stater who is of 22 years of age and has never watched a star trek series in my life and has been a life long fan of star wars.This series's has changed my entire perception of star trek. I would never of thought i would love this. as I thought it was too slow paced. But the complexity of theses characters and the overall development. Has completely taken me by surprise. Even if you are not a star trek fan. I would definitely ask you to check this out
Next Gen,Captain Picard was (and is) one of my role-models,"I read somewhere that Patrick Steward is proud of the educational role Star Trek – The Next Generation had over young viewers. I'm glad he enjoyed his work just as much as we did, because it had indeed quite an influence on me as a child. I practically grew up with the Enterprise crew, and Captain Picard was one of my role-models. Even now, revisiting the series restores my belief that the world will get better.

After all these years, TNG is still so much fun, even more so. In a media landscape full of violence of all kinds, Star Trek – The Next Generation is something to treasure. It's that unique 'feel-good' vibe, the funny make-ups, wild scenarios and holodeck escapism, that make it a magic, timeless adventure. An ode to diversity, exploration, friendship and growth, TNG is the evidence that true values can be affirmed in a manner that is both educational and great fun. Gene Rodenberry had an admirable vision of the future...

The series stayed faithful to the characters until the end, and it's a miracle that it didn't ""jump the shark"", which seems to be the fate of all successful series, for some reason. STNG just got better and better with each season until its final episode, thanks to Patrick Stewart's growing involvement in the production, script and character development. Rarely do we see a truly gifted actor with such dedication to his craft.

Among all characters, Captain Picard shines with his tremendous commanding presence, wisdom and moral stature. Patrick Stewart's talent, professionalism and commitment to the role are that one thing holding everything together.

My favorite episodes include ""Chain of Command"" with the memorable Ronny Cox as a non-villainous antagonist, ""The Big Good Bye"" and ""The Measure of a Man"". There are many, countless others that are just as good, in fact I love them ALL."
Next Gen,One of the best things ever made,"I've watched every episode of this show tens of times. And I never get bored of it. Though some people may not be as easy to please as me, I can guarantee that you will like it.This series was my childhood, and helped turn me into the person I am today. I will never stop loving this series."
Next Gen,"Good when good, very bad when bad!",Thus series represents the relaunch of Trek on TV and produced some much beloved characters. It also was home to some of the absolute worst Trek episodes ever made... I find both Voyager and DS9 have aged better. DS9 especially.
Next Gen,"Bad, bad, bad, bad.","Where to begin? The characters in ST:TNG were just dreadful. The crew was a collection of shiny, happy, perfect, cold fish, with no depth, no passions that ever seemed more than a put-on, and who were evocative of nothing--the sort of people you'd send millions of miles away just to get rid of them. This was probably inevitable, given the circumstances of their creation. Most of them weren't created as ""characters"" at all, but were conceived as nothing more than line-item gimmicks--an empath, a Klingon, a teenager, a Pinnochio-modeled android, a blind man at the helm.

Whatever glue Gene Roddenberry was sniffing at the time convinced him that the last--a blind man leading them--was a *fantastic* metaphor (luckily, cooler heads later prevailed, and the blind guy was packed off to Engineering).

Most of the show's significant elements were cannibalized from earlier projects. Storywise, a gap of about 80 years is supposed to exist between the original series and TNG, but they're still using exactly the same technology, in the time of TNG, as they were in the original. All of the same equipment, with all of the same capabilities and limitations; technology hasn't advanced an inch in eight decades. TNG's one technological ""innovation"" was the holodeck, and even it was lifted from the ST: Phase One project from the '70s (which had mutated into ST: The Motion Picture, sans holodeck). That project also provided two of the other TNG characters: Will Riker was Will Decker from STP1, with Troi as the Ilia-modeled empath with whom he'd formerly had a relationship.

TNG also cannibalized the original series for stories. The first season of TNG was littered, from beginning to end, with plots and other elements lifted directly from the original. This unmotley crew of gimmicks spent their first season blandly going where the first Enterprise crew had gone before. The show improved significantly later but its major defects were structural, and stayed with it throughout (which is why it's so hard to watch in re-runs). The improvements shouldn't be overstated, either: TNG ran for 8 seasons, and if one were to extract all the good-to-great episodes from the entire run, there wouldn't be enough to fill a single season. I found much of it unwatchable when first running, and it holds up even worse on second viewings. Overall, just a really awful idea, done, for the most part, badly.

The writers also seemed genuinely committed to the notion--and this is one of the things I hated most about TNG--that meaningless technobabble is a substitute for competent writing. The ultimate outcome of what seemed like dozens of episodes hinged on whether a polymorphic induction framistat could be made to generate a positronic field, or whether Geordi and the robot could rejigger a 10 power electron thingamabob to elliptically convert alpha waves into magnetized mercury particles.

""Make it so, Number One."" And he does, and the universe is saved. Except that's really, really stupid, and unengaging. This was a problem TNG never overcame."
OMG: Oh My God!,Love the God!! God is our friend and stays in humans not in stones!! Superb subject,"We have always been taught that God is our father always fear God. But this movie say God is our best friend so love the Almighty. Excellent movie with hilarious content.

Movie is story of small Gujarati businessman Kanji Bhai superbly played by Paresh who doesn't believe in God. His life take a big turn when he lost everything in earth quake, Insurance company refuses to claim saying this is act of God and can't be claimed.Thus he decided to take big decision and movie is all about that decision.

Akshay played role of modern God. If you are thinking that why God is modern go watch a movie you will find a meaningful reason behind it. Akshay is excellent too.

Movie criticizes the big business that is based on selling God or we can say playing with emotion of people.

God is not in stones or temples. God is in emotions,humans. Do not donate big amount to temples just help the poor and God will be happy. Don't waste your time searching god here and there instead search in humanity. Be fearless and love the God.

Must watch"
OMG: Oh My God!,OMG - Oh My God!... Must Watch For All Ages.,"OMG Oh My God! Is a wonderful film with an amazing message that everyone should apply in their lives!

Paresh Rawal delivers an outstanding performance, one of his best till date.

Akshay Kumar is top notch you can't think of anyone to do his role in the movie.

Mithun Chakraborty is fabulous as a fraud preacher.

Om Puri, Govind Namdeo, Mahesh Manjrekar and rest have played their roles perfectly.

There are some glitches in the movie like abrupt camera work but it has nothing to do with the story or screenplay.

Grip makes a movie perfect; That's what happens here, you'll get glued to your seats start to end!

I don't know how the play was, but I simply loved the movie.

After Watching OMG! My religion is OMG! Oh My God!

I'll rate it 8/10 Unmissable especially for ""so called"" religious people wasting time, money, milk and oil at temples."
OMG: Oh My God!,What a wonderful movie,"First time i thought its a copy of Bruce almighty or something, but no, its a whole different concept. I think everyone should watch this movie once.

This movie tells a lot of reality which we never know or never wanted to know.

But I think Umesh has done a very good job. Even Paresh Rawal has done a great job.

This movie is worth watch in theaters. Teaches lots of stuff, depends on you what to take or not.

Guys don't think anything, just go and watch.

I ll suggest tell your parents to watch this movie as well.

I don't want to criticize other movies which copies the directions or screens from Hollywood, but this i feel, everything is original.

Yes some of the time you will feel, ""aisa real life me kabhi nahi hota"". but guys this is movie, and you can learn and take what you want."
OMG: Oh My God!,Even God will say Oh My God What A Movie,"OH MY GOD Its the best movie of the year along with Barfi Story screenplay acting everything is perfect. Paresh Rawal and Akshay together created magic as always. Songs are awesome. This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything, comedy, emotions, love, humanity. This movie is a delight for movie lovers, only few biased haters can dislike this movie. Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie"
OMG: Oh My God!,One of the most path breaking bollywood films ever!!!!,"WOW, what a film, I was pretty much speechless after i exited the theater. The message this film gives is that god is in every human being, then why do we go looking for him in mandhirs, churches, mosaics, gurdwaras, etc Why has god and religion become a business, why do we spends millions and billions of dollars at religious places as people when we can take that same money and help the poor, won't god be more happy then. This and many more messages are conveyed in this movie through characters, like Kanji Bhai, Krishna, etc Another really plus point about the film is that it is told in a light hearted way, in a comedy, the film isn't very preachy and still conveys its beautiful and real message. For me when it comes to performances Paresh Rawal has just done such an amazing job, he deserves all the applauds, accolades, awards, in the world for his portrayal as Kanji bhai. Akshay Kumar as always is very good in a small but important role, his and Paresh's chemistry is just too good. Other notable performances Mithun, was really good as the sadhu, and so was Govind Namdev. Music was good and suited the film very well. All tech aspects were just perfect. Umesh Shukla the director is the heart of the film and he has done an incredible job, he deserves, a national award for his efforts, he was just that good. A special mention for the amazing dialogues very smart and well written,

So all in all this is must watch film for not just the people in India, but for everyone in the world. A masterpiece film, this should be India's official entry to the Oscars. its that good and beyond one of the best movies ever made in bollywood. 10 out 10 rating"
OMG: Oh My God!,An intelligent comedy,"Oh My God is based on successful gujarati play Kanji Viruddh Kanji. Oh My God is a story of Kanjibhai who does not believe in god. One day Kanjibhai's shop gets destroyed in earthquake. Then Kanjibhai complains about God in court.

Paresh Rawal is absolutely splendid as a Kanjibhai and his arguments about reality of religion will make you think for a while. Akshay also plays the role of lord Krishna superbly. Surprise package of the film is Mithun Chakraborty. His comic timing is bang on.

First half of the film is filled with some good comedy sequences and second half will make you amazed with some heart touching and heart shaking scenes. Main USP of the film is its unique concept. The film ends with a noble message. Story is perfectly directed by Umesh Shukla and he deserve a big cheer.

Oh My God is a must watch film for everyone because intelligent Kanjibhai and modern lord Krishna cant be missed."
OMG: Oh My God!,The Best movie so far,"Oh My God!!!! yes this is what i have to say after watching this movie. Its just superb,it had everything,comedy,stunt,action,fiction,a serious message and a deep emotional connect. This kind of film is a rarity in modern world. This film not only entertains but also enlightens people mind.You are bound to ask certain questions to yourself after watching the film. It thought provoking and your mindset may change after watching the movie. Everything is said in such a gentle and comic manner that the film does not bore a bit. As per acting is concerned well,u can say nothing to the performances by all the character but to applaud and appreciate. Paresh Rawal in the protagonist''s role has been out of the world,superstar Akshay Kumar portrayed the role of Sri Krishna outstandingly,Mithun,Chakravarty,Govind Ramdeo were just fantastic and all other supportive characters lend tremendous support. The main plus point of the film is its novelty in the story,its acting,its direction and the plot.. You are surely getting amazed after seeing such brilliant film and if u miss this then surely you are missing the best Indian film ever. I can and i think no one can give anything less than 10 to this film."
OMG: Oh My God!,oh my god,"its is the best movie in the resent time with descent story. everyone is gonna love this movie. it really impress me,,,

This movie is the perfect example of how a movie can be good without heroines and item numbers, or action and romance. Paresh Rawal should get national award for this movie,he gave his best. Akshay had a short role but he was best, he was perfect for the role of Krishna. I thought it will be a comedy movie, but after watching i will say the movie got everything,comedy, emotions, love, humanity.

Entry of Akshay Kumar was awesome. Mithun was awesome, loved his character, but Paresh stole the show along with Akshay. Even God will watch this movie and say OH MY GOD what a movie"

OMG: Oh My God!,"Though not a good adaptation but still it is fresh and has a valuable lesson to teach, so do watch it!","First clearing the air about its inspired status, the team clearly accepts its sources in a detailed caption in the titles, making it all official this time which needs to be appreciated. The caption said that the film is based on a Gujarati play, 'Kanji Virrudh Kanji' or 'Krishan Vs Kanhaiya', which was adapted from the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) and then there were two more lines written below it which I couldn't read as it stayed for only less than 2 seconds on the screen. Still it was good to see that the right kind of credits were given to the original creator of the idea as it should be.

As an Adaptation of the original film ""The Man Who Sued God"" (2001) The film is actually developed from the basic idea introduced in this lesser known Australian venture featuring Billy Connolly in the lead. And if one has seen the same then he is sure going to give a mixed response to OMG as it somehow reduces the impact generated by the original. Reason being, that in the English film the proceedings just keep moving in and out of the court and that's it. There are no separate tracks of various God-men and there is no Real GOD coming into Billy Connolly's home to make it filmy.

In the original we only have a case filed by Billy against the God (involving the Church) catching the phrase ""Damages caused by the ACTS OF GOD"" in the Insurance Company's papers and then its all about the court and arguments given for or against the claim filed the applicant. In short, the film has everything focused on the logical points brought forward by the lawyers along with a beautiful insertion of ""A Sign from the GOD himself"" coming into the court-room towards the end, which serves as a pleasant surprise for the viewers.

Plus the original had a brilliant culmination wherein Billy takes his case back, sighting a drastic conclusion for the society whether he wins or loses, which is sadly not there in this Hindi adaptation. Yet OMG scores decently on its own merit with its Indianised version of the concept which remains highly recommended even if you have watched the original flick or play.

As an individual film making a new breakthrough in Hindi Cinema. Looking upon OMG as an individual film for viewers who haven't seen the original English film or the Gujarat play, it is no doubt an appreciable attempt by the makers giving us something fresh and new which we have been loudly craving for. Moreover it can also be called a daring attempt by the team, considering our society's conservative state of mind which always gets active when it comes to RELIGION. So in that terms the film successfully manages to make us aware of the so called ""Religious Markets"" strongly functioning around us like big super-malls with different names and titles.

Director Umesh Shukla and his writing team adds many good entertaining punches which are able to make you think and laugh at the same time. Hence as it progresses, the viewer largely feels entertained as well as tickled regarding his individual religious beliefs, which I personally consider nothing short of an achievement by the entire team. But at the same time the film has its flaws too. It takes too much time to come to the point and then tries to add too many elements into the narration which were not required.

Further, its main publicized theme talking about the GOD himself coming on the earth, seems to be of no use in its basic storyline. So it thankfully remains far away from the Sanjeev Kumar classic YEHI HAI ZINDAGI (1977). In other words, Askhay posing as KRISHNA (and that too on a modified bike like BATMAN) does nothing substantial in the film and is just added to give an extra edge to the project commercially. OMG also loses its grip towards the climax with some overstretched references of Paresh reaching the hospital and then THE GOD giving him the healing touch, which in turn seems to be added just to satisfy the religious sentiments of the viewers emotionally.

Performance wise OMG is one of those few films which has its script as the biggest performer in its more than 2 hours of duration. However regarding the cast, Paresh Rawal is as always first rate carrying the entire film on his experienced shoulders, well supported by his entire cast namely Om Puri, Mahesh Manjrekar & Govind Namdeo. Akshay Kumar making his entry just before the intermission looks cute but the scene stealer in the second half remains Mithun Chakraborty as a Spiritual Leader (like never seen before). In reality the few Spiritual Icons shown in the film are based on some highly famous Guru's presently active in the country which you can easily judge without taking any names. Musically OMG doesn't have much scope but even then the producers have added an item song ""Go Govinda Go"" to en-cash the festival season featuring Prabhu Deva and Sonakshi Sinha dancing to the beat energetically. Cinematography and Background Score just serve the purpose well making a decent impact along with the minimal special effects used to showcase The GOD.

In the last century, New Age Indian Spiritual Masters like J. KRISHNAMURTHY and OSHO kept saying this for many years throughout their life but very few heard them resulting in the present chaos in the country and world over. So here is OH MY GOD giving the same message to the people once again but deep inside I also know that the situation is never going to change for the very reason that,

""We all are taught to be GOD FEARING and not GOD LOVING people by our so called Religious Teachers!"""

OMG: Oh My God!,Movie that enables you to be a better man,"Just watched OMG ! Making a movie like this in India is extremely difficult but the director of this movie had everything written so well. This movie not only makes you laugh but its makes you think about the reality. JOB WELL DONE ! I would not like to ruin you movie by giving spoilers. It does not matter what country, religion or caste you are from this movie is a must watch it brings us closer to the reality of being better human. It enables you to be a better person. As mentioned in Geeta its all about karma. Rather then spending time and bribing god you should do good to make him happy. I come from a Hindu sikh family and this movie did not hurt any of my sentiments or my views. It was very well written and director knew that Paresh rawal would be the best person to start with. Akshay kumar was perfect actor to play the modern Krishna he conveyed the message very well. I have written very few reviews on IMDb, because a very few movies makes go that far. Everything I learned from this movie would stay with me."
OMG: Oh My God!,Best Movie of the Year,"Best movie of the year. It's a ride within a soul! A treat which will force you to think what's actually happening in the name of God! Also One of movie which you can watch with your family.

All the actors were just too good. Paresh carried the full movie and must be the best person to play Kanji Bhai. Akshay was also a treat to watch did full justice to role he played. Akshay-Paresh are the lethal combination. They are best. Direction was also good. Some people might feel it offended but there is Special Disclaimer for those guys. Watch it with open heart and you will see it will leave a high impression on your life.

Highly Recommended! Watch it or regret!!"
OMG: Oh My God!,A brilliant concept: Not perfect but Excellent!,"I have been hearing about this movie from my friends for a few days and at last decided to watch the movie last night. It was a wonderful experience I can tell you that. The strong content of the movie, acting skills of Paresh Rawal,Mithun Chakravarty,Om puri and others have made the movie a tremendous success despite some needless commercialization-tricks and a few weak dialogues. Yes, it is true that the concept of the story is not what we call ""original"" but the importance to point out our narrow perspective as to religious customs was necessary and the movie is successful in that sense. Although the character depicting ""GOD"" was unnecessary and probably was there to make a balance. But the movie has genuinely picked the ""villains"" as these religion-traders are everywhere twisting the original education of religion at their own will, for their own benefit. I would recommend this movie if you too hold humanity above religious fundamentalism."
OMG: Oh My God!,An honest take on life and religion,"It takes guts to create a movie like this one.

This film has used humor in an extremely smart manner to deal with a with a very serious subject of Religion.

I praise Bhavesh Mandalia & Umesh Shukla for their creativity with the story writing and the manner in which they kept the flow of the film very gripping.

And of course one cant say enough about Paresh Rawal, he immerses himself into every character he plays and again in this film he acted his character beautifully.

I highlight recommend this film to be watched by everyone, it will leave you loving your religion (regardless of who you believe in) even more."
OMG: Oh My God!,Best movie,"This movie is on top of my favorite movies. First let me tell you just go and watch this movie. It will help you understand the basics of religion and everything which goes around you.

I have watched this movie i think on third day after its release. I still regret why i didn't go for first day first show. Start of the movie is really good and in mid it becomes interesting and in the end you will understand what is religion.

Few people may find it difficult to watch this movie but trust me watch it till end. I don't want to mention anything related to its story as it will spoil everything.

Paresh Rawal, Mithun Chakraborty, Akshay Kumar, three top actors of bollywood did a amazing job in acting. Awesome movie."
OMG: Oh My God!,Oh My God:A Masterpiece!One of the best Bollywood movies of 2012!,"OMG Oh My God! directed by Umesh Shukla is an excellent movie in all aspects.

I was surprised to know that this movie has not been nominated for any of the categories in any of the Awards!Shame on the jury,for not selecting a movie like OMG-Oh My God! for the Awards and selecting movies like Dabangg 2,Ek Tha Tiger!

The movie based on a Gujarati play,is outstanding.It has an excellent story,clever dialogs and amazing performances.

In a nutshell,OMG Oh My God! is a movie which should not be missed at any costs!

Story: A shopkeeper Kanji Lalji Mehta (Paresh Rawal) takes God to court when his shop is destroyed by an earthquake.

The direction is excellent.

The dialogs are witty.

Performances:

Without doubt,OMG Oh My God belongs to Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakraborty.Paresh Rawal is excellent as the middle-class business man,where as Mithun Chakraborty is mesmerizing as the saint.Akshay Kumar,although having a shorter screen space than Paresh Rawal and Mithun Chakarborty,is significant.Om Puri,Govind Namdeo and Poonam Jhaver are good in their respective roles.

All in all,OMG Oh My God! is an excellent film which conveys a powerful message.I am giving it a ten on ten.Strongly Recommended!"
OMG: Oh My God!,Something deep in everybody's heart has been put in this Movie!,If you know that Paresh & Akashay are in a movie it's gonna be a comedy. but this movie is far more different than comedy. Paresh is at his best. His logic's impress equally to everyone. on one side poor people are dieing of hunger & we are wasting our commodities of mare blind faith. Money making of the contractors of religion is ripped open first time in a movie. Everything is good. but a bit lack of direction is missing. Some things needed a proper artistic presentation. Like God's stunts would have been more creative. In the end the whole Talking could be staged in dream or something. But overall it is a must watch for a different reason other than entertainment.
OMG: Oh My God!,For God's sake don't miss it!,"This is clearly the most path breaking and thought provoking movie I've seen in recent times. India is a place where most people believe in visiting temples, donating money (and/or hair!) and performing rituals to please the Gods. The movie not only questions these practices but also leaves you questioning your own faith.

The movie is not anti-religion or atheistic. On the contrary, it presents a strong opinion about the existence of God. It is probably Paresh Rawal's finest performance since Hera Pheri (2000).

The premise is unique - A shopkeeper sues ""God"" when an insurance company denies his claim for his broken shop during an earthquake because earthquake is classified as an ""Act of God"" and hence not covered in the policy. The court then summons religious powerhouses from across the country as the case is accepted and argued in court.

Mithun Chakraborty is outstanding as the evil/sissy God man. Mahesh Manjrekar is brilliant as the shyster. Akshay Kumar as ""Krishna"" is likable for a change. It's definitely a must see for all age groups. Go get entertained and enlightened!"
OMG: Oh My God!,My two cents: OMG! Oh My God has its heart firmly in the right place,"If I'm honest with you people, I struggled to imagine how this adaptation would turn out as a feature film. Thus, I felt it would be most appropriate to go in with strictly moderate expectations. In the end, I'm pleased to report I came away very satisfied.

The film itself, directed by Umesh Shukla, is an adaptation of an Indian play, which itself was an adaptation of 'The Man Who Sued God'. The plot however has incorporated various Indian elements, and the film on the whole has a very desi feel, and doesn't at all resort to insulting religion. It was wise investment by actor turned producer Akshay Kumar.

Paresh Rawal plays Kanji Bhai, an atheist who is also a moderately respected shop owner who goes about his business in the typical middle-class way, until disaster strikes that is. Kanji, after being rejected by the Insurance company decides to start a court case in order to try and prove that his shop was in fact destroyed by divine intervention, but no lawyer is willing to take his case. On top of that, his family strongly disapproves of his decision. Om Puri now enters, followed by Akshay Kumar. Things get very interesting This film belongs to Paresh Rawal, who so effortlessly carries the film for more than 2 hours. His comic timing is to his usually high standards. Akshay Kumar and him make the on screen goings on memorable and entertaining, once again post the Hera Pheri films

Of the supporting cast, Mithun Chakraborty impresses the most. The character of a swami (holy man) comes so naturally to him. Meanwhile, Mahesh Manjrekar also leaves his mark as the opposing lawyer, as does Om Puri.

The main highlight for me is how the courtroom scenes are dealt with. You get engaged in the drama, and the inclusion of humor makes them even more enjoyable.

A problem is that the screenplay builds the picture very slowly for the first 15 minutes or so. You might get a tad restless here, but be patient. The remainder of the film will more than compensate, I'm sure.

I'm unsure of the purpose of the song 'Go Govinda', which takes up a good few minutes. It looks out of place. The choreography is top notch, however, and the Prabhudeva-Sonakshi duo light up the screen to keep you entertained.

The cinematography is both good and consistent with the purpose of the film - it wants people like you and me to be able to relate to it easily.

I should tell you that, as a theist, I didn't at all feel offended by the premise of the film. A small point, but important nonetheless.

Overall this is an entertainer that urges you to think, and is quite right in its message.

7/10"
OMG: Oh My God!,Wrong message passed. Wish there was 0 rating,"This movie just tries to demean the idol worship without truly knowing its value and tried to mimic some of the great spiritual leaders showing that all spiritual leaders in a wrong light. In Bollywood, people wearing tilak are always shown as villans, why? The makers of movie did not do their research did not deeply understand the concept of guru and the god. They should atleast spend an year or two with these enlightened masters and then make their judgements. Just showing what appears from the outside and influencing young minds is not right

And coming to the movie stars, how are they earning money? Most of them are addicted to drugs. They are so miserable and havent understood any concept of god, gurus or the universe and earn money by showing our own culture in a wrong light. Please deeply understand why one should do idol worship before making such movies and influencing people in a wrong way especially youngsters."
In Line,,
44 Cats,A kids show thats meant for kids,"I dont really enjoy it that much, but again this is for kids. I do agree that the english dub isnt exactly good. But kids wouldnt neccessarily care.

I would rate it 7/10."
44 Cats,The Italian version is better,"After seeing an ad of the show a few days ago, I looked for its Wikipedia page to learn more about it. Upon briefly reading about it on Wikipedia, I found out that 44 Cats is a hit show in Italy that somehow made its way to other countries, including the U.S.

When I watched a half-minute clip of the Italian version, I find it decent. The graphics are very colorful, and the voices perfectly fit the characters.

But upon seeing some clips of the English version which will air really soon, I can't say that I feel the same way about that one. The colorful graphics are retained, but the voices of Lampo and Meatball (and some other male characters) are too feminine. I don't know why but the English dub is a complete travesty of a great Italian series.

With this, I'm sticking with the Italian version."
44 Cats,Cute kids show but English dub voices a no.,"44 Cats is originally an Italian children's show which was picked up by Viacom and dubbed into English and shown on Nickelodeon in the US. Now it's made it's way back across the Atlantic over here to the UK. This has been shown on the channel POP for about the past two weeks. I like cats and children's shows so I watched it. And it was good. The animation was bright and colourful and the quality of the CGI was pretty standard for an animated children's show. The storylines, while not the greatest, were entertaining, if a little weird at times. But then again, most children's shows have strange plots. But if you're a small child, you'll find it entertaining. Now we move on to the main part of any show, the acting! Now, I have only seen the English dub so I can only comment on the English voices. When looking at the cast for this I was most surprised to see that most of the voice actors were also in the Pokemon Anime (Pokemon fan here) I was more surprised to see that the reviews on here at the time of writing this thought that the voice acting was bad as the actors are generally good in Pokemon. I thought the voice acting was good, but the problem was that the voices didn't fit the characters as one reviewer said. They sounded exactly like their characters in Pokemon. For example, Lampo, voiced by Sarah Natochenny, who also voices Ash Ketchum from Pokemon, and has done since 2006. She is just doing her 'Ash' voice for Lampo. Another example are the characters Neko and Zoe are voiced by Alyson Leigh Rosenfield, who voices Sophocles (From Pokemon: Sun and Moon series) and Bonnie (From Pokemon: XY series) respectively. Neko sounds like Sophocles and Zoe sounds like Bonnie. Yes, it may seem I'm nitpicking here, as I'm sure a large amount of the target audience for this haven't watched Pokemon. But honestly it kind of distracts from the show itself, when most of the characters sound like they're in the wrong show. I kept expecting Lampo to suddenly say 'Pikachu, use Thunderbolt!' It doesn't help that both Lampo and Ash wear baseball caps.

English voice dub aside, the rest of the show is good and would probably entertain children for a bit. But if you've watched Pokemon, you may enjoy it a little less."
44 Cats,Very dull,"I remember reading articles on NickALive! about the show (since that site also talks about international Nickelodeon news), but I doubted that it would come to Nickelodeon USA. Surprise, surprise, it did! Nickelodeon heavily relies on SpongeBob and The Loud House at the moment for their animated lineup. Rise of the TMNT is excellent, Welcome to the Wayne was good while it lasted (it was shafted to Nicktoons and cancelled), but RBUK and Alvin and the Chipmunks are very weak. So how does this show hold up?

Well, it's incredibly dull. The stories aren't very interesting. There was an episode that seemed cool that involved space travel, but it was executed poorly. I think the main problem is that the episodes have wonky pacing, and that makes them boring to watch.

The characters are also stereotypical. The generic leader, the generic girl, the generic young one, and the generic fat comic relief (because ""fat people are funny haha""). The side characters aren't much better. In fact, everyone's limited to one trait.

The voice acting is also very bad. I get that it's dubbed, but the voices still don't sit right with me. So yes, this show is very bland and forgettable. You're better off watching Lego City Adventures."
44 Cats,Great animated series,My daughter and I have been watching this show on Netflix. It's beautifully animated and the different scenarios the cats get into are funny. All of the characters are cute and have their own personalities. They also have funny names like Milady and Meatball. I highly recommend this series for young kids like toddlers. My two year old absolutely loves this series and honestly I like it too.
44 Cats,Why is this on Nick Jr?,"I would not call this really preschool friendly. I'd like some guise of education behind the cartoons my kids watch at breakfast. Is there a fad I'm missing? Weird show. Weird voice actors, awkward characters, and silly storyline."
44 Cats,im seeing positive reviews and genuinely wondering if we saw the same show...,"Look i know its a kids show or whatever, but as soon as my 4-year-old younger sister started watching this, i kept walking into the room with it on, and just wanting to throw a brick at the tv each time. The plot is entirely nonsensical and not-cohesive. As an example, here is an actual line from the show: ""this spot is where i usually find four-leaf-clovers"". The characters are bland and annoying, especially the guy who's meant to be the comedic relief, the fat one whose name i cant be bothered to remember. His voice actor does an atrocious job, almost mocking of those with obesity. The animation is unoriginal and mediocre at best. Also these frequent concerts they have in the park just make me shout each time: ""ARE THESE HUMANS BLIND???"", even more so than i did in TOY STORY 4 of all things.

All in all, an utterly worthless piece of garbage with a nonsensical plot, terrible characters and absolutely no attention to detail in the slightest. 1/10."
44 Cats,nice,"A kid can be good guide across the adventures of cats, the bad guy measures - reminding Gargamel - and the lovely old lady. Good opportunity to discover nice crafted animation and new version of cats adventures. So, just nice."
LEGO City Adventures,The best LEGO show,"I love Legoes because there's so much you can make and do with them. It's no surprise that I adore The Lego Movie (and its sequel) and The Lego Batman Movie. Lego City Adventures shows a lot of potential and is the best LEGO TV show to date.

The premise is very intriguing. Although the stories are mostly self-contained, the show revolves around the citizens of Lego City trying to stop a master criminal, meaning there's an overarching plot (somewhat). I like that the arc is subtle, similar to TOTS and Amphibia.

Another thing I like about the show is the fact that it focuses on a bunch of characters rather than just one. It's a very good thing, as it allows the show's rich and diverse cast of characters to have a chance to shine. There's the overly heroic cop Sgt. Duke DeTain, crisis-ready fire Chief Freya McCloud, grumpy street sweeper Shirley Keeper, among others. They all have unique and deep personalities. The focus on many kinds of everyday heroes also gives me Higglytown Heroes and Rescue Heroes vibes.

The dialogue is very clever, there are several good morals like ""Sometimes, you can't always stay exactly on schedule"", and the animation and FX are well done. If you like Legoes, Rescue Heroes, and/or Higglytown Heroes, this show is for you. Definitely the most underrated Nickelodeon show right now!"
LEGO City Adventures,Underrated,"I came across this show completely by accident. But good gosh am I glad that I did! This show is filled to the brim with clever writing, charming stories, and lovable characters! Lego sort of has a reputation for making good animated content (i.e Lego movie, Lego Batman movie, ninjago). But the disappointing thing about this one us the fact that no one seems to be talking about it! This is easily my favorite thing airing on Nickelodeon. Which says alot, because I love loudhouse. But Lego city adventures just has to much more to love!"
LEGO City Adventures,Needs more attention!,"This show is extremely underrated it has many lovable characters! The show has good humour in it. It's not like the other shows where when a episode happens they forget the changes on what happened, plus you don't have to watch the other episodes to watch the next one, except the special. They also give us hints on the upcoming events that will happen, and they show us more about the characters in it. You must watch this show! It's very underated! This really needs more attention!"
LEGO City Adventures,TALK ABOUT IT !!,"I don't know where to start? I found out about this show in October 2019 and ever since .. i made it my NON STOP MISSION to get people to give it a chance .. I fell in LOVE with this show and it's characters... Lego City adventures is a pleasure to watch, re-watch over and over, I would always find something new in my re-watch. the comedy hit me ALL the time, it's a perfect mix of absurd and unpredictable. it fits my humor so much that in several occasion, I had to take breaks from episodes I was watching to catch my breath ! that tells a lot ! sometimes I would feel down or exhausted and re watch some episodes and I would be okay again. this show REALLY makes me happy to know and share about .. ALL characters are adorable and some of them even remind me of myself . it is a REAL shame that outside of a group of fans I've met, no one seems to be talking about it ??? LCA is such a unique concept and watching these characters grow in front of me is something that i don't think, will ever get tired off <3"
LEGO City Adventures,Funniest damn show I've seen in years!,This show makes me laugh so hard! I laugh every 10 seconds! The plots are also interesting and the music is good. This show is overall one of the best modern Nickelodeon shows.
LEGO City Adventures,"Lego City Adventures, A Flawless Mastercraft","Lego City Adventures is really when Martin Scorsese started getting serious with his film-making. While his early works like Raging Bull and Casino were just a bit too pedestrian and pedantic for me, Lego City Adventures is when he decided to start taking things seriously. The character arcs you will see unfold in this show are deeper than most long running TV shows can attain. Overall, Lego City Adventures will bring you into a new realm, with world building better than the best of Tolkien's work. Funny story, Vince Gilligan of AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" actually sent a personally addressed letter to Scorsese upon finishing this masterclass of storytelling. He wrote ""nice, Lego"" which would directly inspire him to create Better Call Saul 3 years later. And that kid that got the letter? She would grow up to become Ariana Grande.

Overall, a master class of storytelling and world building. Bravo, Scorsese."

Mythomaniac,Terrific...,"To the reviewer who thinks it is okay for a french film, wow. How superior of you? And it is a series, not a film... As for Ann Frank, it is hardly making fun of her at all. Tis the book and the child's anxiety (caused by the shenanigans around her) that the mother decides to make disappear ... not the story. This series is a delight and a cross between comedy and drama, very well put together and a lot of fun. Great soundtrack... as for the cancer thing, the ploy was far stronger in Breaking Bad. I get it that for some people it wont work because it has subs, it is of a different culture viewpoint and doesn't fit into the usual series. But if you like quirky, charming and fun give it a try. Oh, and it helps if you are a bit more open to 'different'."
Mythomaniac,Very good family drama,"Thoroughly enjoyed this series and whilst the storyline is somewhat quirky it builds to an intriguing climax. The acting, casting and script are all solid - in fact Marina Hands shines and I'll watch out for her other films.

I'd recommend this and would watch again when my goldfish memory has done its usual trick."
Mythomaniac,Love the series,"Very original and lovely series, great actors, beautiful scenery. This is definitely worth your time if you are into a little drama."
Mythomaniac,Fantastic!,"I'm a TV snob. I normally know within the first episode whether a show is a hit or a miss. I immediately liked all of the characters in this programme. None of them grated on me; I felt something for all of them, and the lead actress is superb in this role. I'm actually surprised how believable this series is. I think that it achieved this by everyone fulfilling their individual parts so well, which in turn means that the end product is cohesive. Completely surprised by this find."
Mythomaniac,I don't know if I love or hate it...,A very original story. Looked very promising. But the characters annoyed me. Especially daughter Carole who made a character change from one moment to the next. And for my idea there are so many loose ends where too little attention has been paid. Left a little confused. And don't know yet if I'm jumping for season 2 ...
Mythomaniac,I loved it,"Great performances, children-actors are brilliant. Compelling story. Can't wait for the next season."
Mythomaniac,Decent drama,"It's hard to add to what the above reviewer wrote ... I'm almost in complete agreement. I would stress that it builds nicely so don't be put off if you're not 100% hooked after E1. The only thing I'd add is that you don't have to watch the dubbed version. You can (as I did) watch in original French with English subtitles turned on. So, not one to return to again and again like the classics; The Sopranos, The Wire or (dare I say) GoT but a pretty entertaining series, if a tiny bit lightweight ... but hey, sometimes that's exactly what you want."

Mythomaniac,Trans representation failed,Didn't director and producers think it was possible to cast a trans actress to play Sam role? I guess they don't give a damn about trans representation or they didn't watch Euphoria or Pose.... Another cis actor with a wig playing a trans woman :/
Mythomaniac,I wasn't,Going to make a review until I read the comments. All the experts about French films etc and LGBT and Anne Frank! Lol! Most of the people complaining about the acting and dialogue probably don't even realize it's dubbed! Or that dubbing is mostly atrocious and makes the acting and dialogue seem horrible. It's hard for me to find a decently dubbed foreign fil or show ( Nobody's watching) was probably one of the better dubbed shows I've seen. I watched about 5 episodes before I fell asleep. I think it's decent and I'm going to finish it tonight and update if necessary.

Mythomaniac,Good story but annoying French male/female stereotypes.,"French films can be tiresome for the character stereotypes they keep portraying. While the plot in this series is well written and very interesting, are we really expected to believe that this unattractive, whiny, hairy dad, with absolutely no job prospects can attract the gaze of 3 (so far) beautiful women who all seem to want to sleep with him? It is so unbelievable it nearly spoils the series. All I could think of was EEEWW anytime one of the ladies kissed him. I really had to put that aside to try and joy what is otherwise a funny but also dark story. Once you can do that it becomes quite interesting."
Mythomaniac,Modern life drama,I really enjoyed these series. I have always had a thing for french movies. They seem so more real than American ones. It tells the story of our modern life and all the typical characters we meet in life or read about .
Mythomaniac,Worth a view,"After watching so many series on Netflix, it was great to finally find one that I looked forward to watching the next episode. I nearly didn't continue after episode 1, but it got better each episode thereafter. I can't comment on the references to cancer or how correct the facts in the story line are, but felt able to relate to the lead characters role in regards to motherhood and struggles with everyday life and mental health. I was shocked to see it only had 2 stars on Netflix, please don't let that put you off! Well filmed, good cast and characters. Just a shame it was dubbed, as maybe some of the depth is lost in translation."
Mythomaniac,Starts good and then goes downhill,"The story and actors are interesting in the beginning until around the 4th episode, when it starts going nonsense, dark and kind of boring. Seems like they changed its genre completely or even the writer.

It has some loose ends, like stories about the kids which go nowhere.

So after around 4th episode it also adds a secret or criminal component about the main character younger life which seems very improbable. I think they did that to justify a second season, bit it's just weird.

I watched it until half episode of s. 2 but it's to unbelievable and boring.

It's unfortunate because as I said, it started very promising.

It's ok to practice french though, it's easy to understand :-D."
Mythomaniac,How to screw-up your average life/ societal existence !,"So far ... so good, however more than ' to be expected ' ... Awaiting season 2 and it's conclusion ... ?"
Mythomaniac,Not a Bad series.,"The acting is pretty good. The story is interesting .

Its actually better than most of the new stuff Netflix is throwing out and around.

When I seen this on the up and coming, My initial response was ""oh cool"" yeah I could wash the dishes with this playing in the background."

Mythomaniac,A remarkable genre blender,"Summary

The second season of this remarkable series maintains the unclassifiable quality that characterized it in the first: a true blender of genres very difficult to summarize as a simple black comedy or tragicomedy, that maintains its audacity and its ability to bother, its melancholy, its depth, in its approach to relationships, qualities that allow it to continue being one of the most original series on Netflix.

Review (includes information from season 1)

The story of Elvira continues, the wife and mother fed up with her family using and ignoring her and who invents a cancer to capture their attention, regain their affection and save her marriage.

Season 1 of this French series had ended with Elvira ""refugee"" in a neighbor's house (and without a job) after leaving her home for having confessed her deception and looking out the window as the enigmatic young Italian introduced himself to his family.

The unpredictable Elvira (the incredible and captivating Marina Hands) continues to live with her neighbor and watch over the movements of her family. Her family nucleus continues to be angry with her. On the other hand, each member of its rich gallery of characters is a world, sustained by admirable performances, each with their great moments: Patrick, her depressed ex-husband (Mathieu Demy), their trans daughter and their two daughters (notoriously grown) , her Italian father, her brother-in-law, her disturbing ex-boss, the sinister neighbor and her strange sect (among the most disturbing of the series), the sensitive neighbor, her beautiful tarot reader friend and, of course, the enigmatic young Italian and others who are will be adding.

After a somewhat hesitant start more focused on comedy, the season recovers its juxtaposition of genres and climates, its audacity and its capacity to bother, its melancholy, its depth in the approach of the bonds, qualities that allow it to continue being a of the most original Netflix series."
Mythomaniac,So so,Anne Frank? Really? Is that what the little girl identifies with? What does Anne Frank have anything to do with this story? Does the little girl identify with Anne Frank? How in the world can this bourgeois girl possibly identify with Anne Frank. An insult to Anne Frank.
Mythomaniac,Really unique series,"First, this is a ""French"" series. It is dubbed. That alone can make it uncomfortable for USA audiences. That being said, this was an important series that I wish was more widely watched.

The story concerns some of the most selfish people in the world and their poor put upon mother who finally, after years of abuse, tells them a lie so they will be nice to her. I would say about 90% of current mothers in the world are this woman. It is a brutal mirror to society and cautionary tale for most young women starting a family. The main character has three insanely self absorbed and bratty kids. At every point in this series, everything that happens is viewed in how it will effect them. Their father is a such a selfish moron that he can't even be bothered to marry the mother of his children, is having an affair, and runs a photo shop -- an indulgence - while his wife holds a real job with an abusive boss to make sure they have money. As she makes clear in a speech with them at the end, it is like nothing she does is important, like no reason to ever do anything with her.

Eventually she tells them she has breast cancer. The change in behavior is so wonderful she can't bring herself to tell them the truth and has a plan to just tell them she is cured. But is found out before.

The reaction? No compassion for mom. No, husband gets to work right away with his lover on figuring out how to get evidence of the lie for any court case, he tells the kids so they will be sure to hate her - of course, they do. Immediately it is all about them. They even have the guts to state that they ""never asked her"" to do things like the laundry or work -- so clearly it is her fault. All her fault. What BS.

No one should be made to turn selfish to keep other selfish people from taking advantage of them.

The ending was a little odd and I am not sure what to make of it but... it makes me interested in a season 2."
Mythomaniac,horrible everything,"The story is very unbelievable and inaccurate. First off, when someone actually has a tumor and it isn't yet clear if it's benign or not, you don't speak of cancer. I feel everyone does know this? Or at least should.

Secondly the way they - unlike a series like Euphoria - still use a non trans person to depict a trans character is disgusting.

The sound design is complete rubbish too. The crickets are too overdone and often completely out of sync when a door opens or closes, which is not how it sound works. Especially since often the sound stops before a door is closed.

The dialogues are very shallow and staged, like a pre schooler playing with barbies. It lacks realness, believability and maturity.

Acting isn't great either.

Honestly I have no clue what would be good about this series. Too many characters, with too little dept.

Insane to think I'm now 6 episodes in and it still has not touched anything, compared to a show like After Life, where in little time you feel for more than one character so deeply you have to laugh and cry soon and throughout. Whereas here you're constantly reminded you're listening too crappy dialogues, poorly acting out a very unbelievable and somehow shallow storyline."

Turbo FAST,Better than the movie,Comentario no disponible
Turbo FAST,Who knew a Cartoon about Snails could be amazing!,"This series has an amazing cast, writing and outstanding laugh out loud moments! The story which I guess takes place after the movie (which is still need to watch), is about Turbo and his Fast Action Racing Stunt Team (F.A.S.T) competing in races around the world. Each episodes last 10 mins in 2 segments, like Adventure Time, Ren and Stimpy etc. The stories poke fun at stereotyping, with funny references that only some older adults would recognize, for example one episode when Ants are invading Starlight City, they act like drones and said 'All your bases are belong to us', referencing the now meme worthy broken English from the game Zero Wing. One of my favourite episodes is where the gang goes to Japan and parodies Anime style fights, with taco clawed ninjas and Godzilla included, some jokes don't hit the mark, but man when they do, you will be laughing out loud!

The animation is remarkable, even better than the film its based on, the colours are vibrant and look incredible on the racing segments. The voice cast is flawless, all characters have a distinctive personality, if a bit two dimensional, I commend the voice actors work, my personal favourites being Phil Lamarr as Smooth Moves and Amir Talai as Skidmark.

With Outstanding humour, voice cast, great supporting characters and an animation style to die for, its really not to be missed!"
Turbo FAST,Phill Lamarr is everywhere,"It looks like hash. It makes the movie look like a speeding masterpiece. The animation is horrible. It's like the richer companies get, the cheaper they be on animation. It seems like they rushed this out because they knew it was hash."
Turbo FAST,One of the most iconic shows ever.,"And this animation is absolutely fantastic, and this show has so many iconic moments that I could literally make a super long compilation, it's the best teleplay ever invented and packed with hilarious moments.

And I'm gonna give this show an A+"
Turbo FAST,Far better than the movie!,"First of all let me clarify - the movie is not bad, it does have great graphics and effects, but did not impressed me at all. So I was more than skeptical about the TV series, but since I showed the movie to my two-year-old son, decided to give the TV series a try anyway.

I was more than impressed with the TV series. Especially the first 3 episodes (currently saw the first 6 episodes from season 1), because they lack violence and it's pure racing fun. Speaking of violence they introduced some creepy insects (my son got scared of the spiders in one of the episodes, so careful with the little kids!), but in general Turbo FAST are super-fun to watch series.

The funny thing is these do not have the superior graphics of the actual movie, but the story is much more interesting and fun. Basically every episode features a race with a different rival with often very funny characteristics. There might be an additional task, like a mini-quest or fight or character dilemma, but in general the series are about the race and this time all the snails do race.

The most important thing is that this movie features very distinct characters and this is what's most catchy here. Every character is projected with unique features, tag lines, moves and look and it makes it a fun journey to the viewer to discover the characters bit by bit in every episode.

What is real fun is that they do incorporate here and there some mild adult fun, making joke of known pop-culture phenomena, like for example ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) and so on (won't go into details for not to spoil anyone).

In general watching ""Turbo FAST"", gives the feeling of watching ""Dexter's Laboratory"" (1996) very much - same short, funny and fast- action packed style of show, except ""Turbo FAST"" seems funnier to me.

And one more important thing - the music is much better than the music on the movie. It is a blend of pop and western-movie- soundtrack (think of Ennio Morricone), so expect some ear candies here.

Basically I love everything about these series, starting even with the title sequence. It's just what TV series should be - short, cool and fun, not necessarily with great graphics and effects - pack a cool story with cool music and let the people have fun watching it."
Turbo FAST,Turbo F.A.S.T is excellent,"Turbo fast is an amazing series based off the not-so amazing movie. My congratulations to Netflix for taking a dull movie with cardboard characters and making it into a clever cartoon series with very individual characters. Every snail in the F.A.S.T crew (as well as the villains) have distinct and unique characteristics. One of my favorite aspects of this show is that it goes beyond just snails and incorporates insects, birds, reptiles, and all sorts of other animals into the mix (again all with their own personalities). Although this may sound childish, I think there is nothing I hate about this show and I love it very much."
Turbo FAST,One of the most underrated shows the whole family can enjoy together. EVAR.,"Seriously? How in the world is this not a more popular and critically acclaimed show?! My guess is that people don't think a spin off show about racing snails from an okay movie is worth investing time to check out, but HOLY-GUACAMOLE are they ever missing out! The character development, the artwork, the writing and the humour are all top notch! This show is hilarious and so brilliantly and creatively put together. Every character is so loveable and funny in their own incredibly unique way. My son, wife and I are always talking about who our favourite is and we just can't decide as they are all so great. Honestly, if I had more time I would write a much longer post signing the praises of every aspect of this show. Top production quality, super intelligent and SO DARN FUNNY for all ages! It's also wholesome and subtlety teaches positive values without being preachy or cheezmo. The brilliant humour covers up the positive messages so well that you don't even realize you're watching stuff that's good for the soul! SO GOOD and I wish there were more shows like this!"

Sweet Home,"Season 2 all over the place, literally","It might just be me, but the older I get, the less able, or willing, I am to grapple with multiple apparently unconnected characters doing apparently unconnected things. Season 1 is great. A close-knit group of people surviving a monster outbreak in a single, claustrophobic environment, where (as the title suggests) home becomes somewhere strange and terrifying. Monsterization is closely linked to human desire. Every monster is unique, and almost sympathetic. But inevitably, the filmmakers decide to expand the storyline, go bigger, move outside those constraints. The Matrix did it. Countless zombie movies and shows have done it. But it rarely seems to work. Involving the military might seem logical, but it kills the uniqueness of the premise, and turns an intense, personal drama into yet another generic post-apocalyptic mess. Monsters look the same, hunt in packs, have no personal connection to the main characters. Lots (I mean lots) of guns. And by the end of season two, I have no idea what's going on. Like I said, that might be me, but I don't think so. It's as if they're throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. Not much, I'm afraid. I really hope season 3 goes back to a smaller, more intense storyline, but I doubt it."
Sweet Home,Why slaughter the entirety of this show in season 2...?,"The first season was definitely worth watching. I'm trying to figure out why the 2nd season lost it all, as I fell inlove with the 1st season, but ended up finding nothing worth caring about in the 2nd.

And as it turns out... The plot of this show was actually based on it's original webtoon. The 2nd season's storyline doesn't take place in the webtoon, as expected...

It seems like the show was taken over by a whole different set of creators.

During season 1, the monsters and their encounters were much more intense, captivating and so much more interesting. The whole setting was claustrophobic, and quite challenging in itself. It was all very suited for this imaginative horror show.

... In season 2 that's what I was most disappointed about. It seemed like the monsters didn't belong in the same horrifying universe anymore, and they were no longer a major part of the story.

Why shift so much focus onto constant drama between a variety of uninteresting, unlikeable, unbearable characters? It's frustrating how nobody is getting along. Everyone argues, slaps and punches each other. Never-ending bitterness, tension and moody whining through it all..? Liking someone apparently means being inlove with a person who doesn't care about your existence at all. Too many are simply heartlessly cruel, as well.

What is there to love about the show, anymore? Is it just meant to get watched, not meant to be enjoyed?

I'd recommend season 1, but to ignore that there's more episodes after. All we can do now is hope that season 3 might find it's way back and somehow remember how it was meant to entertain, or perhaps some of us should just go ahead and read the webtoon instead."
Sweet Home,Great fun,"Awesome bit of fun, if your looking for some kinda bonkers weird horror series to do with these demon-like monsters, this would be something to check out. The characters are enjoyable, fun, and silly. The story is much in the same vain, it's enjoyable, silly, fun, great horror, very reminiscent of Tokyo Gore Police. Soundtrack did make me chuckle, I wander how much ""Warriors"" by imagine dragon costed, we had a fun little bet going as to when it was going to be played. I can't wait for a second season!!!"
Sweet Home,OK enough to keep me watching,"The story arc and plot are random and chaotic. Whatever seems to fit at the moment. The scene cuts were spasmodic. But it was engaging enough for me to watch to the end, even though I was debating whether to continue a few episodes in. Once I got use to the whatever-goes mentality, I could enjoy it."
Sweet Home,Don't give up on first episode,"People who gave 1 point should finish the show. Honestly, at first I did not understand the subject because I haven't read the webtoon. I continued watching and the show really amazed me. It made me think about every single person's unknown inner world. One episode I hated one character and I was like die right now you are so annoying. In the other I cried for that character and prayed for him/her not to die. I loved watching them become a family. Character developments, understanding all of the characters' inner worlds step by step was amazing. In the beginning there was scenes about past and they are confusing I agree but you'll see that they are puzzle pieces and in the end they would complete the puzzle."
Sweet Home,The Story Differs from the Comic but Season 3 Ruined the Whole Thing**,Comentario no disponible
Sweet Home,Definitely worth watching,This is a really good show. A little different approach to the zombie theme but it's good. Don't listen to the haters . I have no idea why some people are rating this poorly. I binged the whole show and I didn't feel bored or tired at any point. Every episode was filled with thriller and excitement .
Sweet Home,SEASON 1>2.,Comentario no disponible
Sweet Home,Weirdly Addictive,"So this is definitely one of those shows that people will either love or hate. I feel like you get a pretty good idea of the tone, atmosphere, and direction right from the very first episode, so if you dislike the first episode then I would not continue watching. Yes, the CGI isn't the best, but it's also not the worst I've seen either. The core of this show is this group of random people in an apartment complex trying to survive a sudden monster apocalypse. It is gritty, dark, and somewhat confusing.

All that being said, I really and unexpectedly loved this show. The weirdness of it intrigued me in the first episode, and by episode 3 I was fully hooked. The characters are really, really great and you can't help but root for them to survive. I loved the soundtrack, especially the use of Imagine Dragons ""Warrior."" I can't really explain why I loved this show so much, it was just this perfect combination of weird and exciting and gory that kept me completely immersed until the very last second. I really hope they give this a second season because there was a lot left unexplained!"
Sweet Home,"Great start, but falls off quickly","I was really impressed by the first few episodes, but series start to go down very quickly after that. It seemed like they've spent most of their budget on the first few episodes, because after that it's almost nothing but people sitting around, talking and crying. Lots and lots of crying. Newly introduced monster designs were crappy and sub part, in comparison to the beginning.

I just hope, that if this show gets the second season, they'll get more money to bring in some new cool looking monster designs, rather than focusing on people fighting people, like they did as the season progressed."
Sweet Home,Way different type of zombie-ish movie!,"Stopped watching for a moment after two episodes just to write this quick review. A fast paced, well scripted and wildly entertaining series with a wacky plot line. I hope it will feel just as funky and complete when I finish this binge."
Sweet Home,The series was a 10/10 through 4-5 episodes and then 3/10 the last 5,Comentario no disponible
Sweet Home,S2 is garbage,"I really liked season 1, but i can't even sit through season 2. It's fine to add some new characters, but this was like watching an entirely different show. There's too much military, but that's not as bad as the whole new cast of characters that I just find extremely boring. The season 1 cast is barely in it. I'm not sure if this is Netflix's fault or not, but their shows often go downhill in following seasons. They change too much for the worst. I have been fast forwarding a lot of season 2 because the dialogue is so boring I can't even focus on it. I'll probably eventually finish it just to see how it ends. But I will continue to fast forward a lot."
Sweet Home,Season 1 > season 2,"Everything about season 1 was incredible, from the variety of monsters to the claustrophobic environment to the character relationships, i loved every minute of it. And then season 2 came around. And i honestly felt like i was watching an entirely new series with predictable twists and a boring plot. We no longer follow the story of the main character in fact we don't even see him until roughly episode 5 of season 2. So many irrelevant characters are brought in to hulk out the storyline and the military is included, making it seem like every other post apocalyptic show out there. In season 1 it was a fight of ordinary people against unpredictable monsters, it was so much more personal but the inclusion of the military makes it so much more detached. I hope season 3 redeems this."
Sweet Home,The best of Netflix this year !!,"I have read the comic, I have read the webtoon .. and I have seen the drama ... it's really great, I love how they have done everything, although there are always differences with the original comics, but ultimately it is a great version, all the actors , the scenes, the atmosphere, the music ... everything, a 10!

It is entertaining from the beginning to the end, it leaves you wanting much more, I look forward to the second part!

The best of Netflix this year !! I need more Asian live actions like this"
Sweet Home,Season 2 Review,"Season 1 was great, a novel and entertaining season. Season 2 however has a lot of what made S1 great now is missing.

One of the biggest problems I have with the show is the protagonist. He turns half monster for the entire season, but other than the healing ability he is completely and I mean COMPLETELY useless compared to other monsters. The first problem is that he will not fight. He will stand there and take punches, hits, stabs cuts and wont lift a finger to fight back because he doesnt want to hurt people. Talk about ridiculous. On top of that they tried to give him some monster ""wings"" so that he can fly around with these monster wings on his back, but guess what""? They literally only gave him ONE wing on his back. You dont have to be an aerospace engineer to know that one big wing on only one side of your back wont work and shouldnt fly, but of course it somehow works. It looks ridiculous though. I am sure they thought it was going to look cooler than it did. All of those things really annoyed me about this season but what really got on my nerves the most was him crying. He is crying in every single episode he is in. Multiple times, and he cries and cries and cries. This is an adult man who is supposed to be a monster but instead cries like a baby all the time. They destroyed this character and had the chance to make a character that was cool powerful an strong yet we got this mess. What a disaster!!

The entire second season is lackluster also in comparison to the first. The story is all over the place in S2 and bounces around a bit too much.

Other than all that negative stuiff, the show IS still entertaining. Some of the monsters are interesting but the CGI this season was much worse than the first season. This season we got monsters that look like transformers made of garbage (they show up in a few episodes). They make the monsters move intentionally very fast so that the camera doesnt zoom in on how poor the cgi truly is this season. The is entertainment value to this show still!! Its not a terrible show, its just not great, I give it a 6/10 for season two and an 7.5/10 for season one."

Sweet Home,It's good.,"It's good, but forgettable. Some much exciting parts, but there's much filler and long flashbacks that is not really necessary. Not anxious for a second season, but I'd watch."

Sweet Home,Fun but disappointing,Comentario no disponible
Sweet Home,Skip the 2nd season,"The first season was really fun, it has some flaw moments, but very enjoyable monsters and great settings. So i was looking forward for another season, but the second season is a whole disappointment, the new characters are just annoying, they do one stupid and questionable things after another. There is too much military involved, it's just another action show, with no interesting plot, boring dialogues and characters. There are, again, some cool monsters, but that is not enough to maintain interest. If you loved the first season, skip this one. You will only be disappointed. Netflix seems to have lost interest."
Sweet Home,"Decent, could've been so much better. Let down for me.","The trailer had me hooked, and I was looking forward to this. The show is visually great, IMO. There's a decent amount of CGI that's hit/miss but various practical visual effects were done really well. The show is very colorful for almost 10 episodes of scenes trapped inside a building. The music was good too, minus the repetitive Imagine Dragons song. So if you like to enjoy stuff like that, give this a shot. One of things that's a plus about Korean movies and shows in general is that they easily blend genres. They make you get so invested into the characters in thrillers/horrors that the genre also becomes emotional - in a good way. Sweet Home has A LOT of characters but it takes time to get invested. But since it's a tv show and since there were so many people, i think it's okay to consume that much time. The monsters too, are very different from each other, unlike what we'd have seen in most zombie-type movies, they too had different personalities. The story though, was a slight let-down for me, I personally found that there were inconsistencies which breaks the suspense/tension/sense of urgency. I felt that there were several questions that were left unanswered towards the end of the show, which was also a let down, but maybe that's just me. Will there be an S2? Will they answer all those questions? I don't know, and the show doesn't end in a way that would make me wait in anticipation for S2 and for those answers. I might not even watch it, answers or not. But overall, something slightly different to watch. I thought that it was visually really good, great music/sound too! Watch this if you're bored and have nothing else to watch. 10 hours is a lot of commitment."
Sweet Home,Edit : They redeemed season 3.,"I left this review after season 2, but I'm updating it now that I've finished season 3. It was SO much better. They cut out a lot of the BS from season 2 and focused back on the OG and best characters. Beautifully acted, it was so emotional, I cried a bunch. Wonderful ending for the series.

I absolutely adored the first season, I've watched it many times. I've waited years and was so excited for season 2. Before season 2, I would have rated this show a 9/10. So what the heck happened? It felt like a completely different show. The style, the pacing, the direction, the acting, everything felt different. There was far too little of the original cast, and none of the new cast were interesting. There was no direction, it was all over the place, I didn't form a bond with any characters or locations. It felt like the show completely lost its heart and soul.

The first 3 episodes are nothing but a military brutality fest with no point other than to illustrate people are worse than the Monsters could ever be. I liked it better from ep 5 on, but it was still just a slog and I was glad to be done.

I've never been so disappointed with a second season. Oh well, I'll always have the first."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Very beautiful and sad .....,"It's incredible the job behind the crew to shot amazing footage. This documentary shows how's frustrating can be to have the perfect spot (if nature allows it).

The last part of the documentary is very very sad ..."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Watch the OUR PLANET series FIRST...,Comentario no disponible
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Night of the Walrus,"Whereas the usual Silverback Productions on the BBC have little ten-minute ""behind the scenes"" segments bolted onto the end of them (something to do with making up the ad breaks on lesser networks) the Netflix series never had to do this - so all of these bits are condensed into this extremely pleasant but fraught supplementary documentary. I often find these addendums as interesting as the core series and this is no exception - showing the incredible lengths the production teams go to capture the wildlife and scenery. Some moments are particularly intense, and most of those involve the humble walrus. Worth seeking out if you've seen the series!"
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,A must watch for nature documentary fans!,"I have always been fascinated with nature documentaries and wonder ""how did they get these shots?"" Well if you have ever wondered that, this is a must watch for you! I have already watched this about 5 times! It is amazing!"
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Never thought about what it took,"I love documentaries about nature, especially when Sir David Attenborough is the narrator.

When I watched this, I realised I never gave it some thought of those who made any documentary about nature possible. I just took it for granded. That is why this was such an eye-opening documentary that made me love documentaries about nature even more. What an effort and devotion these people have to make it all possible for the viewer to watch beautiful scenes of nature. Definitely worth to watch."

Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Breathtaking and informative,"Amazingly shot and well explained, this movie shows the trials, and triumphs, of capturing the nature and the way humanity affects it. Through this movie I experienced both frastration and excitement as the crew and the filming progressed, and I was left inspired. A must watch."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Great for aspiring filmmakers,"Honestly this movie is amazing. I loved our planet as a kid and loved the little 5-10 minute behind the scene shots at the end of each episode. When I realised that this movie was just an extended version of that I was overjoyed. I have always loved behind the scenes of films and this film really helped me see what it was like to film a nature documentary. It made me truly realise that filmmaking is something I want to do later in life. Without this movie I don't think I would've realised that.

Overall this movie is amazing, interesting and helps people realise what the filmmakers went though to film these documentaries for the viewer.

If you liked our planet or if you like filmmaking this is 100% the movie for you. If you haven't seen it I would highly recommend watching it as soon as you can."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Dedication of wonderful people,"I love this documentary.

You got to see what it takes to get just a couple minutes worth of clip. The fact that there are times where the team would spend time in a camouflage hut the size of a small apartment shower room, and had to spend 2 winters in some of the coldest part of the world. Or the time where their nights got disrupted by the tusks of walruses. So exciting.

But of course there are some moments where you simply couldn't help but feeling devastated and emotional because what we human has done to the earth, that climate change have changed the behavior of some animals, doing things their body are not built for, that then leading up to their demise. That was hard to watch. I cried together with the team, as you get to watch the scenery has taken toll on them, but they still have to shoot it, because the world needs to see it, to believe it. Because even if you don't suffer from climate change where you are, does not mean there are no suffering on the other parts of the world. The animal are the most vulnerable due to climate change.

If your friends, family members, or just acquaintances thinks climate change it a hoax, tell them to watch this."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,What it takes to get a great shot,"This is a sort of ""bonus"" episode for enthusiasts of the ""Our Planet"" series. It shows the preparations and execution of some of the most difficult shots. As a photographer and filmmaker, I was mesmerized by the crews' dedication, spending in some cases up to two years to get a few minutes of precious footage. My wife, who is not interested in the technical portion of filmmaking, was as excited as me about this film. We watched this before watching the actual series, and I think it could work both ways. Besides seeing what it takes to get each shot, one also experiences the devotion these filmmakers have for their craft. And, more importantly, their love for the animals. It feels like you're on an expedition with them."
Our Planet: Behind the Scenes,Better as an episode,"As a standalone film, there's really no reason to make this. The exciting parts just tease the awesome sights seen in the full series Our Planet, and any sort of narrative that they build is thrown out the window with the final segment. I'm glad they didn't hold back and kept the last part in, but that part is probably what forced them to make this a separate film. From an editing perspective, the ending is terrible, and not just in the most obvious way. It's cut very awkwardly and gave me the feeling that I had accidentally stopped a movie right at the climax. A few more moments were needed to solidly conclude the episode.

However, as an episode of the show, it would fit perfectly. It still shows some great shots, and it's extremely informative to see the successes, failures, and wild adventures of the film crew."

Into the Night,What happened?,"Season 1 was strong! There was mystery, action and it keept the audience engaging.

Then Season 2 came and the expectations remained high, only to crash to the grounds. The second season does supply the viewers with even a tiny bit more understanding of the general story, the characters once intriguing and entertaining - are now reduced to half-brained children. They just keep and keep on fighting with each other, nobody get's along, no progress whatsever.

It's a shame since I really liked the series, but I can not lie - I doubt how the producers are going to save this mess."
Into the Night,"Season 2, blerk",Comentario no disponible
Into the Night,Ignore the science and just enjoy,"Are there plot holes, yes. Can a helicopter pilot fly a commercial airline, no. Can a home health care aide perform surgery, of course not. Is it enjoyable to watch and am I engaged and care about the characters? Yes. This is not for the ""Must be 100% accurate, or it's trash""! critics viewing from Mom's basement. Suspend your disbelief and just enjoy a nice Friday/Saturday night on the couch movie. The episodes fly by because I'm entertained (and they're short- 38 minutes-ish) and I have no desire to multi-task with a phone game or whatnot.

Full disclosure, I watched in French because I can speak French (it's not entirely in French though) and subtitles don't bother me. I don't know how the English dub sounds, but that always destroys a movie for me when the audio isn't matching the actor's lips. Plus, the dubbed script never quite matches the real nuances of what's really being said."
Into the Night,Langoliers anyone?,Within the first 10 minutes I had deja vus. Airplane running away from an unseen danger.
Into the Night,Great potential,"I love Apocalyptic shows or movies; especially one without zombies and monsters. Give them a more grounded and realistic approach. The threat is real and the plan is also not bad. Actually with much more budget and good writing it would have been an awesome series. Netflix have been doing a good job with international shows with Money Heist, The Kingdom(Korean) and Dark(German). I hope this show get some recognition because I am looking forward to season 2 despite its flaws."
Into the Night,A good weekender,"Great thriller that keeps you on the edge for three and a bit hours. Acting is good but what makes this series intersting is the diversity of its characters and the nuances of their attitudes in the face of crises and tragedy. Morals are given a swirl, whirl and a whirlpool to change colours according to necessities fpr when lives are at risk, crimes have no consequence."
Into the Night,Worthy lockdown watch * season 1,"It's not perfect by any stretch but the short 6 episode season combined with 30-40 min runtimes will more than effectively take up an afternoon without making you feel like you've wasted your time. The pace is good and fast which tells the story which is interesting enough to to keep you drawn in. The acting is good and well cast and there's just enough character development to get you interested enough in them to care about them. You will have to ignore some plot holes, small inconsistencies and scientific accuracy, but hey, it's a sci fi show after all, right?

*edit season 2 has lost much of the steam that season 1 built up on. It's still watchable but I can't pretend to not be disappointed - I'm really not sure where they're going with this and season 3 will have its work cut out.."

Into the Night,A flawed sci-fi thriller series yet entertaining.,"Into the night is the first Belgian series from Netflix and this is more than a decent attempt. The concept is novel (though it is inspired by a science fiction novel) and it kept me on binge mode instead of all the illogical liberties, predictable plot points, and lack of a consistent central core character or a driving force for me to stick on with their journey.

The reason for the series to work lies in the character detailing (however flawed they are, they appear believable) and supreme performances by the ensemble cast. The other aspect that probably worked is the premise, it was realistic There are many scenes that made me empathize with the characters, and made me curious as to how these characters will come out of the conflict they are facing together.

Every episode starts with detailing of any given character, and this approach may confuse the perspective for an audience to chose. Eventually, I got used to the pattern and the constant shift of control to all these characters equally at predictable intervals. The series is not heavy on science, a little disappointed though, hope it will delve more on it in the upcoming season.

From making perspective, it is difficult to plot the entire conflict in one location (aircraft), and the makers have done a commendable job in retaining the interest without attempting to risk a different/novel treatment. The climax (last episode) looked hurried, it felt the makers had a time-bound pressure to complete the season. Having said that, the climax definitely hooked me for the next season.

Into the night - A series you can definitely try!"
Into the Night,"Fun to watch, but OMG THE CHARACTERS ARE SO STUPID!!",I swear these characters' mindsets radiate the same energy as Rise of the planet of the apes. They're like children you just can't like any of them I would kill myself if i was on that plane apocalypse is much better. Could've been 10/10.
Into the Night,Pleasantly surprised.,Went into it with no expectations but it managed to excite me till the end. The background music was really good and it kept up the suspense.
Into the Night,Death Wish,Season 1 was intense good with some annoying illogical moral pontification. Season 2 just got absurd with way too much drama and conflicts. Seems many has a death wish screaming for all to end. It's ridiculous to create so much nonsensical conflict when it's possibly the end if the world. Exhausting to rationalize why so many idiots and morons are running the plot. I literally fast forwarded most of Season 2 to shorten my angst for getting through each episode.
Into the Night,Plot and characters get dumber and dumber,"I enjoyed first season, but as you go through the second season the characters and the plot get dumber and dumber and you reach the point were if there is one functioning neuron in your brain you only can keep watching this as a comedy. The scientists of Prometheus deserve a cameo in this series."
Into the Night,Why write in so many dumb characters?,"When there are too many characters making too many stupid decisions it can cause frustration at the expense of entertainment. Disappointment at the expense of rapport. There are a few characters that follow logic, but too high a proportion whom don't. I guess this writing strategy is designed to generate more obstacles thus tension for the viewers. However, for me, I'm just shaking my head much of the time when another stupendously brainless action happens and considering abandoning the story altogether."
Into the Night,Turkish actor is charismatic!!,Unexpectedly great show!! Great casting and ambiance- especially the Turkish actor is doing a wonderful job!!
Into the Night,Fairly good in it's genre,"For so far it goes about the premise, the origin of the disaster; there are much less believable used in other movies or series.

Basically you have a group of people stuck together by accident trying to survive with a clear time restriction going on.

Yes, some things are probably not very realistic but hé, this is an action-suspens movie/series, not a documentary. And many, many series do it much worse on that front.

I do not really have a problem with that acting. Some persons behave a bit to caricatured. But overal it is entertaining."

Into the Night,So disappointed for the 2nd season,"Season 2 is so boring, Slow and none sense honestly the 1st one was too way better."
Into the Night,"Great promise, so far undelivered!","Worth the watch, I got hooked on it, wanted to see what would happen next, even though what really happened left me very untuned... A good and promising show, with a very promising and enticing script, with intriguing, imaginable and possible science behind it, with actors hitting it out of the park, and yet there is something missing here, leaving you with the question ""so what now, what next?"". Clearly, this series calls for another season without which it is just an undelivered promise. Not a waste of time, worth your while, yet for reasons other than it promises."
Into the Night,"Interesting scenarios, Keeps you guessing.","It's fun to watch but only if you don't take it too seriously, it really is different from other shows and it keeps to its lane and shows that it's different. It's like The Last Ship season 1 but without the military setting and focuses on civilians. It's a good watch."

Into the Night,Decent Belgian Apocalyptic drama set on a plane,"This Belgian drama mostly takes place aboard an aeroplane. As the series opens we see various characters boarding a flight that is scheduled to fly from Brussels to Moscow. Just before departure an armed Italian soldier forces his way aboard and orders the crew to fly west... anywhere west; the further the better. He claims that something has happened to the sun which is causing anybody in daylight to die. Whether he is right or not they have little choice but to obey. They can't stay in the air forever; they will have to find suitable places where they can land, refuel/restock and take off before sunrise. That won't be the only problem; there will inevitably be problems with the plane and tensions between those on board.

This series got off to a good start and thanks to its relatively short episodes, which tended to have single episode problems as well as the main background story, kept things tense and didn't give the viewer time to worry about certain unlikely details. As one might expect the plane, which was far from fully loaded, contains a wide cross-section of people... we even have the cliché of the sick child on his was to emergency medical treatment; this might not exactly be realistic but it serves dramatic purposes as tensions rise. The effects are okay although we didn't need so many shots of the plane flying over what appears to be a major city, especially as the plane is meant to be flying over largely uninhabited areas. Overall I'd still recommend this, despite flaws it is tense and as the final episode of the first season ended I was very pleased to learn the next season starts in less than two weeks.

These comments are based on watching the series in French with English subtitles."
Into the Night,The managed to make me hate every single character,I have never before encountered a story where the writers managed to write everyone so detestable that I can't find a single character I didn't want to strangle to death with my bare hands. This is an apocalypse story where I was cheering for the apocalypse.

Mumbai Diaries,Nice,Fictional representation of true incident and I liked the angle where they showed the ugly face of journalism on the horrifying night of 26/11.
Mumbai Diaries,Nice,Watched the show on the day iot released - Its one of the best Indian TV series so far.
Mumbai Diaries,Nice story,Especially tina desai acting as event organiser in hotel never seen before & How she handles chaos is very nice.
Mumbai Diaries,Great,"Amazing acting, Amazing direction, Super Amazing cinematography and what not. Good Job Team."
Mumbai Diaries,Nice,"Although series does have its setbacks, the only thing that is undeniable is the acting, sets, camera works. Story is here and there and little messy and mostly depends on backstories and emotional reaction of characters."
Mumbai Diaries,Amazing,Mohit raina sir n the entire cast did the great.. Top on emotions..amazing with expressions..do watch it..
Mumbai Diaries,Nice drama,"Those who just want gun shot nd security forces like some action movie might not like it but it has a lot of emotions, drama, fear and humanity."
Mumbai Diaries,Nice,"It shoes u human side of the attack in the sense, a lot of people involved in the incident, their emotions, what a person feels when something like this happens is covered so beautifully that it will make u cry."
Mumbai Diaries,Mediocre,"A failed attempt to show 26/11 in a different way. The idea of showing it through doctors perspective was good, and show was quite engaging in starting as it introduces every character but with time it gets slow and at time time-wasting. Also timing is too much for type of story. Unwanted flashbacks, balancing and over acting by some. Also too many slang used by doctors which looks unreal. Conclusively a poor show on such a important incident."
Mumbai Diaries,Worst adoption of 26/11,"It's not about the 26/11, it's a story about personal life of few people in the background of 26/11 attack. The web series has so many unnecessary sub plots that after 2-3 episodes it's became so boring that I had to stop watching. If anyone wants to watch a good adoption of 26/11 attack then please watch State of Siege 26/11. Only good thing about this series is the casting."
Mumbai Diaries,One of the best web series,Each and every character played amazing role..Lead by Mohit Raina..😊 It is simply amazing to watch Mohit on screen. He just makes everything look so natural. All the very best whole crew and cast of #MumbaiDiaries.
Mumbai Diaries,Good,"It has been inspired by the real events of 26/11 but the majority of the story is fictional., Mumbai Diaries has energetic action and high-octane direction right from the start."
Mumbai Diaries,What have you made? Roller Coaster Ride of Emotions!,"Where do I start from? From the script, screenplay, characters, perfromances to cinematography & direction, this series is a treat to watch. 26/11 was the worst nightmare for the whole country, especially for the Mumbaikars and no one could ever relate to this series than the family who had gone through the terror at that time. But if you're not from Mumbai and still watching it and could feel like everything is happening right in fornt of you, If this series convinces you that you are standiing right at the middle of the chaos, then yes, the team of Mumbai Diaries 26/11 has successfully managed to rule your heart!

There have been a lot of series & films made on 26/11 documenting the black day filled full of blood, fear, anger, terror & what not but this is the 1st time someone showed us the face of the real heros, the frontline workers - healthcare workers, & the police. Ofcourse, how could we miss the most important sector due to which everything had became complex in reel as well as in real - the media. Choosing this concept, the makers had already occupied my mind & had convinced me to watch this and it was totally worth it

Though it was about the people of the city, but what made it more beautiful and relatable are the small stories of the individuals and how it has been connected to the story. The series surely promotes brotherhood & humanity while keeping the facts intact. It showed the poor system of governement hospitals which we all would agree. How much I wish to have more selfless doctors like Dr. Kaushik Oberoi and its residents who could deal with the poor health sectors.

The makers have put all the talented artist under a roof just to bring out the best ever output and no doubt they did justice to it. Mohit Raina, Konkona, Natasha, Shreya, Indraneel and all the supporting cast will definetely make you beleive in their characters. Casting Shreya again as a media journalist was a smart move though it has already been made clear that her role would not be shown in a positive way. I wish they coluld have given her the role of another character but I have to agree, she was as cunning as the way she was shown in Scam 1992.

Taking about how they have shot it while keeping the color pallate according to the mood. The yellow & blue highlights have been used throughout the scenes depictinng the atmosphere & moods of the environment. The framings were sharp. Great job done by the DOP & editors.

Also, I can see a lot of hatred in the review section just because of the one scene where the maker has given a reality check that hindu religion is also a religion that had promoted religional riots. We are all aware of what happened in 1984 anti-sikh riot, what the hindu community did to the people of sikh community. If a writer is stating facts, it would have been a sign of a maturity if the audience had accpeted it.

The climax was emotional. No, there was not any emotionally perceived scene where people are crying. The climax is about the relief that you'll see on the characters face. The morning after a terrified night is a sign of relief & a road of recovery. This would surely make you cry.

Nikhil Advani's move to show the terror of 26/11 & how it mostly impacted the lives of healthline workers emotionally and professionally wants me to write more about it. But all I could write is,

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahan, Zara Hatke, Zara Bachke, Ye Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan."
Mumbai Diaries,Amazing,The camera work deserves special mention and so does the cast of actors who heighten the power of this multi-layered story. What an amazing series. Especially Mohit Raina! His mind-blowing performance in this series.
Mumbai Diaries,Masterpiece!!,"Ultimate.

Excellent acting by everyone.

Mohit Raina - 10/10 for your every shot."
Mumbai Diaries,Story good,"Still, it has shown u a different perspective. It shoes u human side of the attack in the sense, a lot of people involved in the incident, their emotions, what a person feels when something like this happens is covered so beautifully that it will make u cry."
Mumbai Diaries,Terrific Series!!! 🔥🔥🔥,"One of the best series ever made on 26/11 and it looks so real that made us feel like we are there with them. All the cast and crew done fantastic work with putting there all blood, sweat and hard work into it. Amazing series to watch."
Mumbai Diaries,Overacting,Why all are giving exaggerated expressions in every scene ?
Mumbai Diaries,Pathetic,"It's an insult to a tragedy that robbed human lives. If the writers/directors/producers wanted to highlight the struggles faced by frontline workers in a government facility, they could have made a different series and not mixed it up with 26/11. By botching up the facts of 26/11 and adding heap load of drama they ruined everything. Konkona's acting was the only thing that was bearable (I could only watch 3 episodes) , so one star for her, everything else sucks to the core."
Mumbai Diaries,excellent series,Good performance by all artist. Excellent Direction.
Mumbai Diaries,Excellent movie,Actors have done a killer job. And I liked this movie.
Mumbai Diaries,A must watch,An outstanding portrayal of the sacrifice given by our Forces and Medical Practitioner. Feeling sorry for people who it rated low. Mohit stole our heart.
Mumbai Diaries,Good movie,"Everything perfect Watch it, its definitely worth your time.....you will not regret a single second of this.....every single episode will blow your mind...."
Mumbai Diaries,Factually incorrect,"Well , if u see it as fiction about 26/11 attacks it's fine , but if we see it as a medical drama , there are lots of factual errors As a doctor I could identify how they made wrong diagnosis almost every time.

Get your medical facts right."
Mumbai Diaries,"Episode 1 & 2 was superb, but after that it went to normal Bollywood type average","1. Episode 1 & 2 10/10 2. Raina sir 08/10 acting super, but 2 star decreased due his wrong selection of project. His all projects were suberb...this one average becaue of screen play .

3. If all things shown is 100% facts, then I will appreciate ,but if it is a fictional one then definitely he don't deserve a success... 4.climax was good ,but as I said other episodes were average and feels like artificial....."

Fullmetal Alchemist,The best reboot,"Fullmetal Alchemist was originally made in 2003 and after 6 years he received one remake following the original Manga.

While the first couple of episodes are done better in the original after the 12 episode the anime just blow up in one of the best writing adventure and history I ever seen. Every character receive a time to shine and the animation is fantastic even after 10 years.

You probably gonna love this."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"No complaints, seriously. FANTASTIC.","Let's make one thing clear before I start this review, I have no experience with the previous incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist. This series was my first foray into the world of FMA, & I must say, it is VERY excellent.

First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy. Despite its mainstream appeal, it still maintains a mature tone that really grabs you.

The animation & art is top notch. You won't be getting any poorly edited sequences or grotesque looking art. The production values are great. I watched the series with the English voice track, and the dub did quite a good job. No complaints there. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.

It goes on for some 64 episodes, & maintains your attention the entire time. It even manages to close everything up in a satisfying manner. A fantastic series. This show will make you laugh, cry, and even get angry a few times.

Loved it."
Fullmetal Alchemist,So well executed,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing, I love every minute, the characters are great all of them receive a nice development, the voice acting is amazing too both dub and sub are great, animation and the choreography are awesome.

This is perfect series for anime and mainstream fans, just watch."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Surpasses the original in almost every way,"This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.

When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist?

With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show.

I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic ""in those days, we really believed..."" lines from Al.

With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open.

Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had.

If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better.

Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out."
Fullmetal Alchemist,A review from an NOT anime fan.,"I'm not gonna lie, I don't like animes, seriously since I was a child I never feel any type of interesting from Naruto or Dragon Ball, but this one, oh boy he really put the bar on a really high standard.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an anime that you can enjoy even without like animes(he really resembles the Avatar for me) the story is so well written I'm impressed with the alchemy a how close is from the actual alchemy, the animation is great, soundtrack is good and after the episode 19 I'm could force me stop watching, the plot is so entertaining that when i finished the last episode my spirit was elevated to the maximum.

While I don't know much of other animes this one is really impressive I definitely recommend."
Fullmetal Alchemist,This series teaches a class on how to count a story,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece, it's one of the best series of all time and definitely the best animation I ever watched.

Great action, voice acting and amazing animation. And the philosophy about this show is very powerful.

Overall:9,4/10."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Just might be the perfect mainstream series,"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.

Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.

It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.

A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I can't believe that took me so long to watch this,"""Shounen"" is usually described as being an uninspired genre made for kids, with sub-par watered-down thematic execution and repetitive plot elements.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood kills all these notions, it was the grandness a shounen has,but also has the thematic and philosophical crux, which the traditional ""edgy series"" have. The characters grow and develop, the cast is amazing and also is one of the rare Shounens anime that have indeed good female characters, story started simple but grows in a amazing and addictive way. Is smart without being overly dumb, it's a TRUE package that anyone cam enjoy."
Fullmetal Alchemist,I feel like my spirit is elevated after having just finished the last episode.,"I've seen this show recommended by many sources. Finally I decided to watch it.

At first I was kinda disappointed. The first few episodes didn't make a huge impression on me. But as the story progressed and I got to know more and more fantastically written characters, the backstory started to unfold and alchemy expanded, it just got better and better.

At a point I suddenly found myself addicted to the show. When one episode finished, I immediately started playing the next.

The story deals with morally heavy themes. There is some seriously dark stuff in there. But there is also light. Once you experience terrible things in this show, it is truly cathartic to see some hearthwarmingly good things unfold as well.

This show will make you feel very deep feelings. I have to admit to be crying at some points. It is a true roller-coaster.

You will get so attached to the characters that after the series is over you will seriously miss them. That is a quality of a great show.

The scope of the story is bigger than anything I have ever seen before (no joking, the stakes are bigger than in any other fantasy / sci-fi).

You will find yourself truly rooting for the good guys, worrying about them, and cheering when they seem to succeed in combat against a foe.

If you want to be amazed, addicted, emotionally lifted, press the start button on this show."
Fullmetal Alchemist,The Best Anime Ever,"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I think is the best anime ever made.

First of all the the voice cast were chosen to perfection every voice portrays the character as who the were meant to be.

Secondly The Storyline was so well written compared to the first series. story flows wonderfully as we witness the journey the characters take and the many twists and turns that occur.

Characterization was also excellent. once again I will mention the voices but also the way characters interact with the complex guidelines of the world they inhabit.

And lastly the animation is very fluid no cheap faraway shots where the characters are talking but not moving which is used commonly(see Neon Genesis Evangalion).

I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time Choose Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Pretty much the best show made in the history of mankind,"Ill explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.

*Note that English isn't my native tongue* I've been addicted to series for like... forever. I could probably list at least 50 full series I've seen from all kinds.

If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn't have believed it.

This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.

The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.

All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.

Of all movies and shows I've seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.

If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn't be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.

One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.

This is one of the only shows I've ever seen, where i haven't been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.

Perfection.

See it.

I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"Losing my interest about halfway through, but -did- enjoy it.","It's waring on my patience, the more character's that get introduced, the pointless conversations, -completely- pointless sub-plots. It feels like a lot of this show is either localized in an incredibly contrived way, or there's quite a lot of filler.

Still, I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons (or Parts as Netflix is calling them) and due to the love this series has gotten I'll keep trying to watch. Not a -true- anime fan - I like Bebop, NG:E, Akira, took the chance on this and loved the charm and bounciness of the the plot of this show. I'll edit this if my opinon changes in some major way."
Fullmetal Alchemist,A Fantastic Reboot,"Having been an avid fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, i was highly apprehensive on hearing about this reboot, but the more i found out about the series, the more excited i became. I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.

The new series features better artwork that resembles Arakawa's style more closely than the last series. There is more humour, especially Ed transmuting a spear-head into his face. There is a new soundtrack, which admittedly, at times doesn't work greatly, but with some getting used too, i'm sure it will grow on me. Overall, i feel this series is a fantastic reboot, and is verging on turning Fullmetal Alchemist into the series it should always have been."

Fullmetal Alchemist,Best of all Anime and better than the earlier version,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.

The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.

The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.

Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.

I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.

When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.

Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.

Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)"
Fullmetal Alchemist,Fantastic.,"I have seen the entirety of the Full Metal Alchemist series that was produced in 2004. The series has a sizable cast which are unique and interesting in their own way. They all have specific characteristics which make them stand out from each other and sometimes oppose each other with their philosophies. This series does things that may others attempt to do. They manage to develop the characters and their story lines in a very beautiful manner. This series has one of the best plots that I have ever witnessed with just the right amount of action, humour and tragedy all excellently blended together to create a plot that keeps you wanting more from start to finish."

Fullmetal Alchemist,A Well Made Story.,"First let me say that the music/OSTs in this anime are just magnificent, there is not even one single bad opening! Every opening them is just so perfect that you can't stop listening to it! The background music is so goated! My favorite op is the 5th op ""Rain"" by SID and it's actually my all time favorite anime op, the greatest opening ever. But other than that the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story about two brothers and their journey to try to get their bodies back is a perfect storytelling, with a great writing to every character and a really good characters design and a nice world building plus a fine animation. Something that I really like about this anime is that how they show you all this things about the military and how you can't trust people no matter who they are and all this thing with the dogs of the military etc... I also like the philosophy in this anime but I don't want to say too much here, so if you really wanna know what I'm talking about search on YouTube ""The Philosophy of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" there is a video there by ""Wisecrack"", I recommend you to watch it if you've already finished the anime."
Fullmetal Alchemist,"The Anime Equivalent of a ""Passing"" Grade","FMAB is good and checks all the boxes, a plot that makes sense, good characters, some good character arcs, and good worldbuilding. However I feel it doesn't do anything truly 'amazing'.

Is it the most gripping story ever told? Does it have an amazing score? Phenomenal voice acting? No - watch AOT instead

Does it have the coolest characters? No - watch Code Geass instead

Does it have the greatest animation ever? No - watch Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen

This anime is the definition of checking all the boxes, meeting all expectations, but never going above and beyond. I can tepidly recommend this, but I can't say I really loved it."
Fullmetal Alchemist,Meh...,"I just can't get why people love this series so much?

I watched the original series as well, and this also. I loved the original and everyone told me this is way better.

All I see there is cheap animation (still frames all the time for minutes), music without any emotions, fast shots, each dramatic moment just screwed up by bad decisions like chibi animation and funny music. It kills the mood all the time.

The characters making silly decisions, everyone is brainless. I feel I do not care anyone, the whole story is just kids play, without emotional struggles. It has no weight after all. At the end I felt I do not care who will win, what will happen, because it is happening because the heroes just screwed things up, so it is the minimum that they will fix it. Each character is the same mass without any characteristics (only a few exceptions).

I really tried to like this, I have seen many anime worse than this but I can rate it just as ""meh..""."

Fullmetal Alchemist,Still a loved one world,"**English is not my first language**

After more than a decade, this story is still one of my loved one sagas of all times. The world building, the drama, the - so human - themes and the characters (all characters!) are the strength core of it. Plus, we have a very good animation, a impressive tied plot and pace, gorgeous music and the ten last episodes that takes your breath away.

It has a world with its own laws and unique landscape and lore, that could be expanded on and on.

Fullmetal is one of my loved one stories of all time, side by side with the worlds of Middle Earth, Westeros, Hogwarts and the whole Star Wars drama."

Ouija: Origin of Evil,This prequel has no business being as good as it is.,"This prequel has no business being as good as it is. The first Ouija film came out in 2014 and quickly faded away into obscurity. So imagine my surprise when they decide to make a 'prequel' of all things. I hunch is that The Conjuring films have been pretty successful and they are set in the 70's, when things were a little creepier, no cell phones and genuine scary aesthetic. Imagine my surprise again when up and coming horror filmmakers Mike Flanagan was the man behind the camera. The underrated mirror horror flick Oculus and deaf home invasion flick Hush were two of his recent outings. Things were looking not too bad for this flick and to top it off, it received some pretty decent reviews.

Alice and her two daughters run a scam business in which they ""speak to the dead"". The mother justifies this business by telling her youngest daughter, Doris, that it helps people move on and get closure. When her eldest, Lina, plays the new Ouija boardgames at a friends house, she tells her mother to incorporate it into her act. She does and things take a sinister turn when they scam becomes reality.

It's hard to make a game board scary. The first film tried, failed and this one tries and succeeds for the most part. Any non-horror fan might balk at the idea that this film is good, but I consider this movie to be one of the most underrated flicks of the year. Flanagan knows how to build solid tension and he doesn't rely on cheap scares or an obscene amount of gore. This film has none of that. Careful framework and lighting is all he needs to create an unsettling atmosphere. Whenever someone decides to look through the ouija glass piece, you feel yourself tense up expecting something to happen.

Kids in horror films are the go to for anything scary. Most movies tend to cast children horribly and they end of ruining the film. Doris, played by Lulu Wilson delivers an innocent and somewhat chilling performance as the youngest daughter. Her goodbye message to a young boy about what it feels like to be strangled to death is an excellent scene to send chills down your spine. No scary images, sounds or blood needed. Just a child delivering one monologue about suffocating you.

Obviously the film is far from perfect, but it doesn't cater to the happy ending crowd either. It takes some chances and for the most part, lands them. I was surprised by how much I liked this film, which may be why the rating is higher than what others would tend to give a film like this. Had the first film never existed, this would be a bigger hit."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016),"When I first heard about this sequel/prequel my initial thoughts were: ""Who the hell asked for this?"" The first Ouija was cookie cutter horror film. It use the device of a ouija board (and the mystique and eeriness of it) as a crutch for the thin, awfully written that followed. It was a completely forgettable experience, so one would wonder why the film series was brought up again. Its a good thing that first impressions are just what they are because this prequel is not bad at all.

The film was in better hands when it was announced that Mike Flanagan would be directing but I was still mixed. Oculus was actually pretty great. A creative idea that was actually pretty emotional and investing. Flanagan's followup was the Netflix film Hush. I know a lot of people loved Hush but maybe these people don't watch movies often or are lenient to what they see on Netflix. Hush was terrible. I don't want to go into it here but maybe some other time I can explain how improbably dumb it really is. Anyways, this film is a prequel of sorts to the first and is based on a family who help people move on from their passed loved ones by staging seances. A ouija board causes dark spirits in the house to possess a young girl leading to trouble and at times, some wicked fun.

The film is set in the 60s and you can immediately tell by the film style. The style is of a film you'd see from that era; they even used the old Universal Pictures logo at the start of the film. Its not just the post production editing of the film but the costume, music, and just all around aura is done very well. No one knows her well yet but Lulu Wilson made this film. She does a great job and there are a few moments (where the script was fantastic) and she was able to come off as unsettling, just from saying her lines. She is without a doubt the strongest point of the film.

The film isn't without flaws. The third act isn't exactly fantastic as some questionable things happen and you scratch your head wondering if there could have been a better resolution. There definitely could have been. Also, the CG does look ropy at times but I think that can be forgettable as the film offers decent entertainment value. Here's a film that sacrifices scares for build up, good performances, and focus on the story of why spirits have possessed Doris and the circumstances surrounding whats going on. I can respect that.

I'm usually extremely critical of horror films because these days so many films go for jump scares and have no substance. There are exceptions that are becoming smart, nostalgic, or reinventing the horror genre. I don't think there is anything innovative about Ouija: Origin of Evil but its a massive improvement over its predecessor and is a film has a good amount going for it to make for a good time.

7/10"
Ouija: Origin of Evil,shockingly pretty good,"It's 1967 Los Angeles. Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) runs a crooked spiritual reading business out of her home. She uses her daughters Lina (Annalise Basso) and younger Doris (Lulu Wilson) in operating her scams. They incorporate an Ouija board into their production. While trying to contact the girls' dead father, Doris seems to make real contact. Father Tom (Henry Thomas) is the headmaster of the girls' school. Mikey (Parker Mack) has a crush on Lina.

Surprise! This is actually good. It is well-made. The characters are well-drawn and well-acted. I wouldn't say that this is breaking down any new walls but there is good in doing good work. I do have a couple of small nitpicks. For some reason, Alice and Father Tom go out for what looks like a fancy dinner. It almost looks like a date if it weren't for the characters. Second, I would keep the possibility that Doris is scamming everyone until further into the movie. It would be nice to have Father Tom uncover the whole situation as a reveal. The good are the actors, the mood, the simple premise, and good construction. It's a shocker that this is all pretty good."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,Deft Direction and Stellar Acting Carries the Movie,"If you first ""Ouija"" film, you might have been inclined to skip this addition (a prequel) to the series. No one would blame you. ""Ouija"" is a laughably awful film. ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" however, is a surprisingly competent and thoroughly enjoyable horror movie.

Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that ""O of E"" turned out so well. With the steady guidance of director Mike Flanagan (Hush, Oculus, Haunting of Hill House), one of the most consistent creators of scary stories in the business, we should expect high quality work. Once again, he delivers.

The story revolves around a recently widowed mother and her two daughters. At risk of losing their old, creepy and possibly haunted (definitely haunted) house, the mother resorts to work as a fake medium to make money, calling on her daughters to contribute to the ruse. Things get more exciting when the mother brings home a Ouija board, not knowing that sinister spirits would soon possess her younger daughter.

Then, as we witness the little girl's behavior grow increasingly strange, our goosebumps grow increasingly prevalent (because creepy little girls are a reliably freaky scary movie trope). The older sister soon suspects something, the little girl crawls on walls, and a priest shows up to help. That stuff is predictable and somewhat unoriginal. But this movie still works because of its splendid acting - the little girl, Doris (Lulu Wilson), is particularly impressive - and deft direction.

Mike Flanagan clearly knows how to run the show. He makes sure that ""O of E"" becomes a far cry from other horror movies of this ilk, which possess so little inventiveness in their direction.

With this film, we are treated to elegant camera movement, unnerving closeups, and evocative framing and angle choices that all appear purposeful and thought through. Instead of calling attention to an evil presence on screen with a hard cut, we simply see a shadowy figure crouching on the edge of the frame.

Flanagan also chooses to include limited jump scares and, mercifully, no fake jump scares. Fake jump scares are what I call those moments of building tension when the sound goes silent, then suddenly there's a blast of jarring noise that makes us jump out of our seats as the camera reveals a harmless friend character. It's a cheap manipulation, a dirty trick. We deserve better, and Flanagan gives us better.

Rather than turning to a loud and bombastic score to sell scares, Flanagan relies on the editing and our natural inclinations as viewers to feel scared. He trusts that when something scary that unexpectedly appears in front of us on screen, it will deliver chills.

""O of E"" delivers a slow-building eerie viewing experience. There are no excessive bursts of violence. Nothing is over-the-top. It's a small-scale movie, but one that is nonetheless effective. I recommend it to any fans of possession movies, especially if you prefer ones devoid of gore."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,atmospheric horror that deserved a better-written ending,"This is an solid, slow-burn, atmospheric horror movie; well-paced capped off with a thrilling third act. It very effectively combines a simple plot, and natural characterization, with good acting and direction. The result is a compelling story that is believeable and susupenseful.

At the end of the final act, I was thinking ""high-fives all-around, good job guys"" and was about to give this two thumbs up.

And then, inexplicably, in the last 5 minutes the filmmakers revert to cheesy B-horror cliches making for a jarring denoument that simply feels wrong.

WTF? Was that studio exec interference or just plain bad judgement? Nope. Because it's a prequel (to a movie I haven't seen yet), I guess it had to end with a bridge to the other movie. But it could have and should have been better, so the truth is, it's just bad writing. The last few minutes just don't match the tone or narrative arc of the first hour and a half, and it comes across feeling like a cheap add-on. Not a twist (""cool!""), or a surprise (""gotcha!"") just lame (""seriously? Pffthtttt!"") (That's the raspberry sound, BTW.)

This movie should have wrapped up nicely at 1:27:25. If it had: 8/10.

With the dopey last 4 and a half minutes added: 6/10.

PS - If you can, stop watching at 1:27:25 and just imagine a better CODA; e.g., Lana, the sensible one, getting on with her life as best she can, and the Ouija board washing up on some beach like in Jumanji."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,Better Than The First,"It's rare to find a sequel that surpasses the first these days, but Ouija: Origin of Evil manages to just that. Not that it was a very tough feat considering the original was one of the most lame-brained movies I've seen in a while, but Origin of Evil improves upon its predecessor tenfold - just not enough to make it really worthwhile.

It's obvious that Mike Flannigan is on his way to becoming one of our true masters of horror, but this film seems more like a paycheck movie for him and it shows. He does the best he can with the tepid material, but ends up using the old ""distorted faces/mouths with rolled back eyes"" effect a few too many times and it quickly becomes tedious.

Like all of Flannigan's films, it's wonderfully well cast and beautifully put together. I just wish they'd spent a little bit more time with the script. You might be better off watching Flannigan's Hush, Absentia, Gerald's Game, Occulus, or The Haunting of Hill House."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,So this is where it all began!,"It is a decent horror film, but surely better than the first. The previous part was an usual teen themed horror where everything started as a playful. But this one was a prequel and it focused on the origins. A single mother with two daughters is making money helping the people who want to contact their beloved dead ones. The things changes when her little daughter started to communicate the spirits of her own. The chaos unleashes, the house becomes haunted and the family begins to fall apart.

Keeping it simple is what worked out well for the film, despite thematically borrowed from others, scenes were kind of familiar and characters intentionally developed. Particularly the priest role was the most overused in any horror film. Followed by the twist. That turning point was good, but not a new. Nice performances and well shot film. Ouija is a fine concept for a horror theme and with this film's somewhat success, I hope the next one would only get better. So it is worth a watch, if you're not anticipating a something special.

Ouija: Origin of Evil,"""Ouija: Origin of Evil""- Everything the lame-brained and poorly made original was not. Atmospheric, well-paced and lovingly crafted with taste and thoughtfulness.","Perhaps the most shocking and surprising treat of the 2016 Halloween season is director Mike Flanagan's prequel tale ""Ouija: Origin of Evil""- a skillfully crafted, tasteful and highly atmospheric follow- up to the disastrously bad 2014 thriller ""Ouija."" It's frankly stunning just how good a film Flanagan was able to build from such a poor foundation, weaving a tale that honestly not only runs laps around it's far inferior predecessor... but honestly made me completely forget about what came before. In my mind, ""Ouija"" will be a forgotten victim of studio greed, while this prequel will stand tall as the ""true"" film based on the iconic and controversial board-game of terror.

In the 1960's, widow Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) works as a fortune teller out of her home, staging false séances with the help of her teenage daughter Paulina (Annalise Basso) and younger child Doris. (Lulu Wilson) After purchasing a Ouija board as a new gimmick for her work, Alice does not notice that Doris has become overtaken by a deranged and mysterious force associated with the board, instead believing that her young daughter's newfound abilities and knowledge of things she could not possibly know are signs that unlike her, Doris is a real medium. However, as Doris' abilities become gradually all the more powerful and sinister, Alice and Paulina must band together to try and break her free from the devious spirits of the past that have taken ahold of her physical form...

Flanagan directs from a script co-written by Jeff Howard, and much like his wonderful previous efforts ""Oculus"" and ""Hush"", here he continues to shine as one of the finest new voices in horror. There's a certain sense of taste and thoughtfulness he injects into his work, as he takes his time to try and establish strong character and interpersonal relationships, in addition to identifiable human drama which helps to accentuate the fear that builds. He also just knows how to deliver a darned good scare- a skill he uses expertly throughout the entire runtime here to build a great sense of foreboding dread.

The performances are all stellar as well, helping to add to the film's high quality and impact. Elizabeth Reaser is fantastic as the mother Alice, and you really get a feel for a person lost after the death of their beloved spouse who is trying to hold it together for the sake of her children. Wilson is a great new Doris and does remarkably well for an actress of such a young age. Supporting roles by the likes of Henry Thomas are all uniformly strong and help to round out the cast in likable performances. And Annalise Basso steals the show as Paulina (also known as ""Lina""), who becomes our main focus and is a strong presence on-screen. At only 17 years old, Basso is definitely one to keep an eye on in the future. She possesses talent far beyond her years, and is the beating heart of the film as a sister and daughter struggling to help her sibling and mother from the forces at play- both supernatural and emotional.

The film does falter at times a bit, which is where it loses points. Despite the first film being decidedly very poor by comparison, this film does a bit of distracting ret-con work that may bother those who are familiar with the original. Some major details of the backstory and rules are changed, which made it feel a bit inorganic as a continuation. It's also a bit too heavy on the scares up- front, which lessened their impact. I would have preferred more slow a buildup. And it does lack some drama since this is a prequel and you'll be able to guess some of what happens based on this fact.

Still, that cannot stop this from being a darned good and very well- assembled supernatural horror. It's not one of the best horror films ever made by any means, but it's a solid and highly entertaining thriller boasting some heart, some good scares and a great cast. This is the movie you've been waiting for if you've wanted to see a movie based around the idea of the dreaded Ouija board. My advice? Skip out on the first film and just watch this as a stand-alone. It's far more rewarding an experience than the awful original could ever hope to be.

I give ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" a strong 8 out of 10. If you're open minded, be sure to give it a shot, especially if the last one let you down. Take it from me... this is a very pleasant surprise."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"Better Than It Has Any Right To Be, But Still...","Mike Flanagan just gets so close yet again, yet falls disappointingly short. Oculus is still his best work, and the promise that both Hush and this prequel to a PG-13 board game prequel show, is that if given the right opportunity he might really be capable of a cold-blooded classic.

This is a film that shouldn't exist, should never have gotten theatrical distribution and definitely shouldn't have attracted the likes of Flanagan (okay, he probably did this to increase his clout in the industry, but still). He musters some great work here, following familiar supernatural clichés but bringing his own touch to the proceedings.

The setting is beautiful, the characters likable and not completely square. The atmosphere is given time to build, he luxuriates in teasing and messing with audience expectations (as a way of spiting this, and goosing the audience lulled into a slow burn placation, he includes an explosive scene wherein the actual demon is seen shoving his fist down the little girl's throat. It's both too much and a necessary jolt at the time, a conundrum if ever there was one and a small encapsulation of everything right and wrong within this film).

It's too bad some of the nice work done in the first 2/3rds of the film is undone by a clichéd, boring, exorcism-lite finale. None of it is very scary, and it all has the feel of fitting into the ""Ouija"" franchise package, whatever in God's name that could mean. Considering the stakes here, what Flanagan does is still impressive."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,Really bad movie,"Im a fan of horror movies. This flic though was a real waste of time. Bad acting which only got worse along the way. If someone tried to make Exorcist fan movie with no skills and made the story up while filming, this could be the result. Reminded me of some Ed Wood movies in a bad way. Do not waste your time would be my advice. If it only was even worse, it could be at least interesting."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,Pretty Creepy & Scary,"I am by no means a hard core horror film buff, but I do view them from time to time. I found this one to be quite the creepy little horror flick, and it gets increasingly scary as it progresses.

As I've often noted, I have to overlook some of the really dumb decisions made by characters in horror movies, and this one is no exception. Also, the plot elements here are similar to many I've seen in this genre. However, I felt it was quite well presented with good acting from all the cast, well directed by Mike Flanagan, and solidly written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard.

Overall, this film rather creeped me out and I'm still thinking about that scary ending."

Ouija: Origin of Evil,Great atmosphere and decent enough plot to keep you interested,"I want to note that I'm an avid horror genre fan who literally watches at least one horror movie a night. I'm stingy with my ratings and this is one of the better ones out of the 60+ horror movies I watched in the past 2 months.

The only thing that I can mention as a slight negative for this movie is that I wasn't a huge fan of some of the visual effects. I don't dwell too much on that though. And it's not to say they were terrible or anything, just could have been better.

The story is interesting and the movie flows well. Definitely not a slow-burner. I would say it's slightly underrated as it stands at 6.2.

If you're looking for a horror movie with a worthy plot and at least some character build-up, this is for you."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"Nice horror, with some good tricks","A nice horror movie, good as a tasty snack before lunch. Enjoyble for fun with friends, with some interesting scary tricks. It let me the impression that was made for purpouse to seem light, unpretentious, but still decent horror movie."

Ouija: Origin of Evil,Worth watching for the creepy moments,"Bottom line: I think this was worth the watch, but I was torn between 5-6/10. It's a pretty decent supernatural horror with some surprisingly creepy moments for PG-13.

It's got a good atmosphere, some mystery, and a good creep factor.

They did a *really* good job with the creepy faces on the various supernatural encounters and that made me really glad I watched it. If you're into creepy stuff, you'll probably enjoy that too once it gets going.

The acting and characters felt pretty bland, which held the score back, but it was still enjoyable. I probably would have given it a 7-8 if they did a better job with that."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,New-age ghost movies don't do it for me,"Am i the only one who finds newer ""horror"" releases to be completely predictable, boring, and the effects unimpressive? We're living in an era where Paranormal Activity(don't get me started) made enough money to make numerous sequels...I've tried seeing some recent films like Mama (okay), The Babadook (decent til the end), Lights Out (actually was decent), and now this, and CGI just makes things NOT scary. Was the film itself nicely done? Yes. I liked the cast, the acting wasn't bad;they actually looked like ""real people."" But the cliché where the little girl happens to know more than everyone else about the evil spirit, she becomes possessed and it becomes like every other attempt at an exorcism film. Not only are we supposed to fear a child, we are supposed to fear a child that has a liquid-like face that stretches and CGI whited out eyes, she runs along walls (last ten minutes) and says...stuff in other people's voices? I just don't get how this can pass as good. 3/10"
Ouija: Origin of Evil,"A pretty captivating little horror flick, and beautifully shot","I wasn't really expecting much from this one. The IBDb rating was pretty low, the title is a bit cheesy, and the writers, directors and cast are not exactly A-listers. None of that mattered though as this one was actually pretty good.

First off, the scenes were beautiful. It was like watching a warm sunset. In addition, the direction and camera angles really enhanced the suspense and intensity. The special effects were also top notch and at one point I was like, ""Whaaaat? That is cool"".

I was pretty captivated throughout, although it did have it's clunky moments but not too many of them and they quickly worked their way out of them.

The cast did a superb job with the young Lulu Wilson pretty much stealing the show. I'll most likely be seeing her again in my nightmares. Annalise Basso, Elizabeth Reaser and Henry Thomas also did an excellent job so I don't want to sell them short either.

Overall this was a pleasant surprise with moments of nail-biting suspense. Definitely worth the watch on a dark and quiet night. Oh, and one other reviewer mentioned not watching the preview. I didn't so that might have helped."
Ouija: Origin of Evil,A lot better than it has any right to be,A somewhat cliche but well constructed horror with genuinely frightening scenes.
Ouija: Origin of Evil,This movie does a better job of connecting its story to the previous film that it does of connecting events within its own story.,"Ouija boards developed from practices that are nearly 1,000 years old and have been controversial almost from the very beginning. The modern version of the boards, which supposedly allow users to communicate with the spirits of the deceased, developed out of the centuries-old Chinese usage of an automatic writing method. The hole in the moveable planchette device was eventually widened and the writing implement was replaced by a small piece of glass through which users could see letters and words on a flat board, thus receiving messages from the spirit world. This ""Ouija board"" (the name probably coming from combining the French and German words for ""yes"") was patented in the U.S. in 1890. It has survived in the same basic form up to the present, but has been criticized - by scientists who claim that the users are the ones actually moving the planchette (whether deliberately or unconsciously) - and by Christian groups who believe that the boards could lead to demonic possession. This fear, coupled with the game's origins, became the force behind a dozen or so horror movies since the 1980s. 2016's ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" (PG-13, 1:39) is a prequel to the ""Ouija"" horror film released in 2014.

This film portrays the origin story of the evil in that house featured in the first film, much as it was related in ""Ouija"". ""Ouija: Origin of Evil"", takes place in the mid-1960s and focuses on the three female characters at the center of the 2014 film's mythology. Alice Zander (Elizabeth Reaser) is a widowed mother of a teenager named Paulina (Annalise Brasso), or Lina, as her family calls her, and a little girl named Doris (Lulu Wilson). Alice tries to support her small family by conducting séances for grieving people desperate to speak to their deceased loved ones. Alice has a few tricks up her sleeve to help her unsuspecting clients believe that the information she gives them is for real and that their dead relatives are really blowing out candles in response to specific questions. Alice's girls are in hiding, making the tricks work. Lina accepts that it's just a scam, but Doris doesn't really understand everything they're doing, so Alice explains that they're helping people by comforting them and giving them needed closure.

After attending a party during which her friends played with a Ouija board, Lina convinces her mother to add one to the act. As Alice is working out how to manipulate the board's planchette for her ""readings"", she accidentally summons a spirit which begins possessing young Doris. As the spirit seems to come and go, Doris starts acting more and more strangely – doing her homework in ways that are beyond her capability, frighteningly dealing with a schoolyard bully, channeling voices, learning the hidden secrets of their old house and, just maybe, talking to the spirit of her dead dad. Of course, Alice is worried about her daughter, but comes to believe that Doris is a legitimate medium, like Alice's mother was – and Alice wants to talk to her deceased husband too. Unfortunately for everyone involved, this is a dangerous game that Alice is playing. Caught in the middle of all this is Lina's boyfriend, Mikey (Peter Mack), and the principal at Doris' Catholic School, Father Tom (Henry Thomas), who helps Alice figure out what's happening and why, what's real and what's not, and what to do about it, risking his own life to do so.

""Ouija: Origin of Evil"" does a good job of connecting its story to the original movie but that's part of the problem. You won't necessarily be lost if you haven't seen 2014's ""Ouija"", but you won't fully appreciate what's going on either (especially in the very short post-credits scene, which you should just skip if you haven't seen the first film). Apart from the connections between the films, the connections between events in this film are not well established by Mike Flanagan's and Jeff Howard's script, and Howard's direction fails to build any real sense of dread – or much concern for the characters. Also not helping matters is the acting, which is pretty shaky, except for during the film's climax. Unfortunately, that resolution feels even more random and disjointed than the developments leading up to it. Many people seem to feel that this film is an improvement on the original, but that's not saying very much. Actually, knowing that these films are produced by Hasbro Studios, which is owned by Hasbro Inc., the company which currently produces the official Ouija boards, tells you all that you really need to know. If you have a Ouija board, ask it whether you should go to see this movie. If the planchette moves and hovers over the word ""NO"" well there might be something to those boards after all. ""C-"""
Ouija: Origin of Evil,This is better than the original,"Recently I found out that about this prequel and I have to say, I was surprised with how good it is compared to the original. Don't get me wrong, it's not the best movie ever made but it's a movie worth to watch, from a perspective view I can't say anything bad about it, personally yeah, I wish it was more scary but it was scary enough for my best friend to be afraid to go to sleep. It was refreshing to see a horror movie like this one since nowadays movies rely heavily on cgi, not that is bad but the quality of the cgi seems to have been getting worse and movies seem cartoonish in a way, luckily this movie it's not like that."

LEGO Friends,"Quite cheesy, somewhat tedious","The film is very basic and not very well thought through. The characters aren't very well portrayed, especially Andrea, because throughout all of the Lego Friends books and sets that came before this film, all of the girls are described as caring and the best of friends, where as Andrea comes across as snotty and very selfish without a care for her friends, which is inaccurate. The graphics are quite basic, and this put me off a little. But, my problem lay with the plot, because it was tediously delivered. The script was cheesy and also somewhat cringe worthy at points, such as when talking about weight loss or gender stereotypes. It's just the kind of thing that probably isn't going to be accepted by people who are really PC in this day and age."

LEGO Friends,Horrible Message for Young Girls,Comentario no disponible
LEGO Friends,Why does this exist?,"In the 2010's, there was a trend of LEGO direct-to-DVD movies being churned out. While there's not as many as there was being pumped out at the same time, there are still these kinds of movies out there. And one of these movies is ""LEGO Friends: Girlz 4 Life"". And yes, it's intentionally spelt like that. My first major complaint is the animation. It looks fine, but there's barely any LEGO in this movie, in a movie based on the toys. Even the 2012-2015 TV series had LEGO in it. Then there's the soundtrack, which is fine, but my complaint here is that the movies headlining song ""Girlz"" is played, what, like, 5 times in the movie? Now, the plot of this movie is that the girls recorded the ""Girlz"" song, and then Olivia gives the agent of Livi, a pop star, a flash drive with the song on it, leaving Livi to call it her own song. Then the girls devise a plan to get the drive, and tell her ""Hey, this is our song!"". In terms of the character portrayal, Andrea, at the start of the movie, feels like a selfish little twerp who only cares about fame. Though, thankfully, she redeems herself towards the end. And the voice acting is pretty bad. Because the song ""Girlz"" was recorded by L2M, a band made up of kids (why?), they didn't bother to rerecord the song for the adult actors. Also, the credits is a literal music video, showing the deities who made this movie. So, all in all, this is not a great movie for kids."
LEGO Friends,Awful,"This burns my eyes, I mean this movie is for kids but this is so bad. Even my sister that is 6 years old hated it. The details are ok but the graphics are seriously terrible. In my opinion it NEEDS only 1 star. What bothers me most, is how their lips are moving and the words just does not work together. No, this movie sucks."
LEGO Friends,Nice movie,"The first 30 minutes were really boring but after that I really liked it! I liked the message, to not give up even when it's tough."

Crash Landing on You,16 Precious Episodes--Cherish each one!,"It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters. And not just the main characters whose chemistry was magical but all the supporting cast as well. They lent a depth and breadth to this tale--the good guys were endearing and the bad guys were classic. Caution: You will have to suspend judgement about a few circumstances but if you ever read Peter Pan, you will easily want to believe they can fly. Personal note: I started watched K-D's because I am 75 years old and wanted to keep my mind sharp by reading subtitles. I don't know if my mind is sharper but my heart is warmer thanks to this wonderful series."
Crash Landing on You,IT CHANGED MY LIFE,"I've never, ever watched a Korean show and this show just shook me to the core! The plot is out-of-this-world, truly original, and the acting is amazing!!!! I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries and I can't get enough of it! It's way better than any Hollywood production. Just do yourself a favour and watch it!!!!"
Crash Landing on You,AMAZING!!!!,I made an IMBD account just to write a review for this show. This is my favorite K-drama!!! The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long. Easily rated 10/10!!!

Crash Landing on You,Great Romantic series,"I don't watch korean series much! just randomly play this series on netflix, but this is exception. the more episode i seen .. i the more i am in love with the story line, characters of each role and many more.

Hyu Bin & Sonye Jin you guys are rock! Congrats for making korean series worldwide via Netflix"
Crash Landing on You,Their chemistry is not a joke!,"Another korean drama that give me the vibe that hard to gain from other dramas. The chemistry, the plot, the cast, the place, the way they act, sooooo gooooooddddd!!! I really love this dramaa. This drama is freaking good. It has the feeling that hard to move on... And also become lot of peoples' favourite. I just don't want this drama to end...will be really missing them, all of the cast."
Crash Landing on You,So good I want to cry,"What makes this KD different from other KDs? 1. They used older actors which IMO are better in acting. Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin are definitely the best choice for RJH & YSR character. The chemistry are inevitable! 2. The story is flawless and not boring. There's a speck of love story, comedy, and action in one KD. What not to love? 3. Beautiful sceneries. Omo. 4. Everything makes sense. No stupid magic or ghosts whatever."
Crash Landing on You,Ridiculously Amazing Love Story!!,Comentario no disponible
Crash Landing on You,Superb Love Story and More,"With this KDrama, we have a proven team: terrific writer, director, co-stars, and cast in a delightful love story but also lots of fun with the captain's squad, the village ajummas, a really evil bad guy, and jokes and teasing. These charms are combined with the longing for reunification that handles both North and South Koreans with love and respect. And both leads are at their most beautiful and talented. I swear Hyun Bin has never been better with that quiet, low voice, steady eyes, and sly smile taking every scene but never dominating. And, of course, Son Ye Jin is wondrous: beautiful, brilliant, touching, and hilarious. This series is a treat."
Crash Landing on You,I love Hyun Bin,"Anywhere from ""Memories of the Alhambra"" to extreme like ""Rampant"" , ""Crash Landing on You"" is by far more captivating. Anywhere from little hints to Looks of shuttle love gets me on the edge of my seat, but it's his emotions that make it so heartbreaking. He really brings so much emotional acting to the scenes and I should have known watching memories of the Alhambra. But, this has definitely got me hooked. Everyone wants a knight and shining armor with an edge. Korean dramas are much more on spot compared to many and I have to say the writers went where the love and mystery meet...where no one can go. Thank you and I hope to continue watching many more!"
Crash Landing on You,Crash Landing on My Heart.,"""If you give up on waiting, the pain of loss will kill you. That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.

Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:

1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.

2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.

3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.

4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.

5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.

6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.

7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist."
Crash Landing on You,Start of my Korean drama odyssey..truely!,"I never understood the global appeal a d popularity of K pop music, dramas and frankly, would have been ignorant if I hadn't given it a try. Netflix happened to be promoting this new title and I enjoyed the trailer...peaked my curiousity and wanted to see more. I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard! I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now. I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list. In lockdown, good opportunity to get 'pop cultured'!"
Crash Landing on You,Nice and different storyline but something is missing..,"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19"
Crash Landing on You,I am a Korean,"I recommended this to my British friend who had script writing work experience. For the first 2 episodes, he said this isn't his style - cheesy romantic comedy. But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.

Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!"" Haha succeed !

I truly hope that all of you are wishing North and South Korea reunify one day.. and cry with us.."
Crash Landing on You,Will touch the deepest part of your soul!,"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""

I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter. I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.

""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!

How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.

The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.

I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.

As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.

I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.

I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.

Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.

This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!"
Crash Landing on You,Currently watching it a second time and here's why ...,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did."
Crash Landing on You,I hope this is a keeper,"Recently, I have been trying so hard to get hooked on another K- drama. All I ask is that they keep the humor fresh and the romance sweet.

In two episodes, I am already drawn in. I now hope that some romance occurs, but the future of this drama is yet to be determined.

The series follows Ye Ri, a South Korean heiress when she accidentally falls into North Korea after a paragliding accident. All because of a tornado that had flying tractors. I laughed when she pointed that out.

I hope Ye Ri has a good character development arc, I would love to see her grow. You bet I will continue to watch this. Sign me up, you got a fan."
Crash Landing on You,Well balanced and memorable,"It was a long time that I had not watched K-drama before watching this drama and I must say I made a right decision. This drama packs
great scenery: the color and atmosphere are so soothing in Swiss that you wish you could be there
laughs and humor: unpredictable punch lines are not scarce
beautiful love story: you will smile /cry happily and swoon for the couples' cheesy moments
plot full of twists: this drama is not some kind of bland linear story. Its story has depth and meaning
many more: hot actors and actresses, funny supporting characters and lots of moral and life lessons delivered in deep and gentle ways
Just watch it and you will have a good time"
Crash Landing on You,THE ABSOLUTE BEST,How can something be so beautifully written and so amazingly acted at the same time? I have read a lot of other k drama reviews which say the best k drama ever and was disappointed after watching that. But THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE. I cried a river watching the last episode and I plan on crying a bit more watching it AGAIN and AGAIN..
Crash Landing on You,"Once watched episode 1, you will not be able to stop until the final episode","Last K drama I watched was princess hour. In my late 30s, I was told by EVERYONE of my friends and workplace colleagues to watch. After a struggled to watch and reluctance many weeks, one episode, bang, here I watched continuously for 2 days. Until now, I still kept repeat watching for tenth time. The palpable chemistry of both actors could exploded whole North korea, albeit there was very small intimated love scenes. You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time. The Romeo Juliet love story like this could not be felt if not the superb acting on both protagonist actors. I hope they will get many awards and some chances to perform in Hollywood series one day."
Crash Landing on You,"Instant Classic, an Absolute Masterpiece","I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.

And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.

I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).

Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.

The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.

My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?

And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.

Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding."
Crash Landing on You,Solid Gold Classic,"What can I say about Crash Landing on You that hasn't been said already? For starters this drama belongs to the Premier Division of k drama IMO, in line with Secret Garden, You Who Came From the Stars, Legend of the Blue Sea. Not entirely coincidental these dramas were aided by respectively the same actor, Hyun Bin, and the same screen writer, Park Ji Eun. The question remains: what's so good about it? I think it is the right mix of story, actors & music.

The Story

Crash Landing on You combines many proven genres that capture a worldwide audience from the start: action, romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, business, rags & riches. Moreover it is meticulously written according to the golden rules of screen writing: 1. Use the time of your audience in such a way that they will not feel their time was wasted 2. Give people at least one character to root for 3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water 4. Every minute must either reveal more of a character or advance the action 5. Start as close to the end as possible 6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet your characters, make awful things happen to them to show what they are made of 7. Don't try to please the whole world, this only weakens your storyline 8. Give your audience as much information as possible in order to stay hooked. The storytelling is also rock solid: boy meets girl - they get into trouble - things go from bad to worse - there is a closure but at the same time it keeps us from knowing if new developments are good or bad, hoping for a sequel.

The Actors

Even well written stories are made or broken by the cast. In this case the acting of each and everyone was on point. I can't imagine any other actor playing the lead than Hyun Bin (the stern and sturdy North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk) and Son Ye Jin (the sophisticated South Korean chaebol heiress Yoon Se Ri). Also the supporting cast did a great job, with honorable mentions for Yang Kyung Won (sergeant Pyo Chi Su who speaks North Korean to a T according to North Korean defector Kang Nara) and Bang Eun Jin playing the emotionally scarred mother of Se Ri.

The Music

So, we've got our story and the right actors, but the soundtrack is the cherry on top. No surprise this soundtrack leads the Top 10 of most downloaded OST's of ALL TIME at the moment I'm writing this review.

Rewatch

Sometimes I can forget a story as soon as the clue has been reached, but I think I will definitely rewatch this drama. There are many layers in the episodes that deserve a re-run.

Verdict

Overall, if you haven't seen this already, go watch it, and get in line with others who are longing for The Sequel."
Crash Landing on You,This Korean show has it all,"It has many things going for it that will keep both men and women waiting for new episodes. The action, comedy, and drama all have perfect timing and the actors are all great at their craft. Sixteen episodes is not enough for this show!"

Crash Landing on You,Crash Landing of a Show,"I might be the only one who found this show overrated. It is excessively long with too many unnecessary scenes and too much padding. The portrayal of North Korean people helping someone like Se-ri and being a mix of corrupt, unsophisticated, or peasant types is laughable. This show is the Disney-fication of North Korea, which, in reality, is a cruel, merciless regime. The storyline is utterly ridiculous."

However, do not think that it's bringing anything new to the table. It's nice entertainment, without any real disappointment, but it's a light meal.

It's real and only strength lies in the slick and extremely colorful graphics. they have their own style and there's not denying the appeal or the design of the alien home world.

The rest is merely acceptable. The story is linear, the scenario unimaginative, and the dialogs simple.

I liked it because it was fun, but don't expect much out of it and you won't be disappointed."

Escape from Planet Earth,"Enjoyable, but nothing spectacular","Good story, if a little bit uninspired. Some good moral points and impressive twists. As far as animations go, quality is right up there and an interesting ideas on how extra terrestrials could look. great variety in shape and sizes as well as a believable planet network. enjoyable graphics and great voice acting with a few celebs Took me forever to figure out who one of the characters were! but got there in the end. Nothing extra ordinary about it, some good takes on human way of life for the adults to chuckle at. All in all an enjoyable movie, and while its not up with the best animations i've ever seen i certainly enjoyed it and will recommend it to any kid/kid at heart who likes scifi!"
Escape from Planet Earth,"Average, but entertaining","I took my 9yo and 7yo to see it while a friend of mine with a 5yo did not want to expose her child to a PG movie. Honestly, Tom & Jerry, Road Runner, and Popeye cartoons are 10x more violent than this. It easily could have been G rated. The violence was very mild. The movie was pretty good with some funny parts but many references will go over most kids heads while parents will laugh (do any children under 10yo know what ""Area 51"" refers to??) I would recommend saving yourself money by staying away from the 3D version of this movie. The first comment from my 7yo after the movie was, ""there wasn't much 3D"" and she was absolutely right. There were some, but by the middle of the movie, you don't notice it. Movie has a pretty good story line. Not a great movie, but not bad either. Good movie to see on a rainy weekend or day off of school."

Escape from Planet Earth,The whole Area 51 monster movie send-up is fun but that's about it.,"'ESCAPE FROM PLANET EARTH': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

An animated sci-fi adventure film about a popular astronaut hero from another planet who becomes trapped on Earth and has to be rescued by his computer nerd brother. The all-star voice cast includes Brendan Fraser, Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, William Shatner, Jessica Alba, Sofia Vergara, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jane Lynch, Craig Robinson, George Lopez, Steve Zahn and Chris Parnell. It's directed by first time feature film director, and former storyboard artist, Carl Brunker and written by Brunker, Bob Barlen, Tony Leech and Cory Edwards. The animation is colorful and fun to look at and the cast is impressive as well but the story and scene content is pretty simplistic. I liked the monster movie sci-fi send-up though.

Scorch Supernova (Fraser) is a popular astronaut superhero, of sorts, on his home planet Baab. He's looked up to by many there but his brother, Gary (Corddry), is the brains behind their team and he always guides the dimwitted Scorch through his missions, from the BASA base where they work. Gary never gets any of the credit though and even his own son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit) idolizes Scorch. When their boss, Lena (Alba), orders Scorch to travel to the 'Dark Planet' (Earth), in response to an SOS there, Gary knows it's a bad idea (due to the fact that no other alien life form has ever returned from there). He advises Scorch not to go on the mission but Scorch ignores him and the two get in a huge fight when Gary quits. Scorch goes on the mission without his brother's help, for the first time, and is captured and imprisoned at Area 51. It's of course up to Gary to save him.

The animation is beautiful to look at and has a lot of character to it, unfortunately the story doesn't. It's about as simplistic and by the numbers as you can get. I like a lot of the actors in this cast (especially Corddry, Gervais and Vergara) but their talents are wasted here. Fraser is perfectly cast as the dimwitted hero, once again, but he's the only star that really adds anything special to his role (which is funny because he's arguably the least talented). Like I said the whole Area 51 monster movie send-up is fun but that's about it. It should please kids but other than some great looking animation and a decent score (including a cool song by Owl City) the film has little else to offer adults.

Escape from Planet Earth,"Good animation, but the humor overdoes itself.","Blue alien named Scorch(Brendan Fraser) is quite the thrill seeker, every time he goes on a mission. With his brother Gary(Rob Corddry) who is behind the controls guiding him on the missions, Gary is not a thrill seeker like his brother, they are from the planet BAAB. Scorch gets a new mission, to go the forbidden planet AKA Earth. Gary refuses to go along with it. Cause he is tired of being in his brothers shadow. When Scorch gets captured when he does arrive on earth, it's up to Gary to rescue him, but will he?

The animation is almost up there with Wreck It Ralph. The jokes seem run themselves into the ground. Most of the time instead of trying to have a story, I feel it was going more for satire. Not that it was terrible, but not has good as Monters Vs Aliens(2009). Brendan Fraser and Rob Corddry are alright in voice casting."

Escape from Planet Earth,Surprisingly Good,"This is my first movie review on IMDb so bear with me. I had my doubts at first about watching this movie considering it's not done by the main animation power houses ( Disney and Dream Works) but to my surprise it's right up there with the big boys.

The animation is exceptional,the character designs are great,the storyline isn't half bad,the characters compliment each other well.In my opinion it's way better than the Croods or Rise of the guardians.

All in all,It's a fun movie to watch.The only thing I didn't like was the voice casting of Brendan Fraser as Scorch Supernova.He just didn't do it for the character.But on the other hand Sarah Jessica Parker did a great job voicing Kira Supernova.As for first time feature film directer Carl Brunker he did a wonderful job directing this one."
Escape from Planet Earth,Chix Chat on Film Review: Great Sci-fi animation; not very engaging.,"As a fan of animated features, I figured that this was a good opportunity to start the year off with some fun and fancy. Escape from Planet Earth looked from the trailer as if it was a story of captured aliens farmed out to work for free, inventing all the convenient gadgets that mere Earthlings could never have conceived. That concept was taken directly from Men in Black but that didn't dismay me I still expected a pretty good story to unfold. It turned out that this was one of the best looking worst written stories that I have had an opportunity to view lately. The animation was first rate, and I thought that would translate into a first rate film. It was sometimes hard to stay in the moment, my thoughts strayed numerous times. The first half hour was just a series of animated physical comedy that was not particularly funny, stepping on a broom and being popped in the face is just plain unoriginal and old. I believe that the issue with this story was that it was trying so hard to be good by adding in all the elements that make for a good movie that it somehow missed the mark. There was at the very foundation of the story the sibling rivalry between Gary Supernova (Rob Corddry) and his younger bigger brother Scorch Supernova (Brendan Frazier) and with them the brain versus brawn was at the core of their contention. There was some tongue in cheek Area 51, trailer park behavior, and a number of other hijinks that should have been fun or funny but just weren't. I suppose I expect a story to make sense and the opening scene with Scorch saving babies who happen to be in an unmanned crashed spacecraft was just ridiculous, so the rest just seemed like fodder. I did like the fact that Sofia Vergara (Gabby) was not just there for her sex appeal. As I mentioned before even without seeing the film in 3D which I didn't it looked great, the animation with all the pretty colors would be appealing to a small child, and they may find the broom in the face funny once or twice, but thrice! I don't think so. This is definitely a good rental to keep the little ones entertained in the comfort of your own home, but you can't leave them unattended since there is that PG rating. I give this film a red light."
Escape from Planet Earth,Excellent cartoon!,"We took our ten year old, and as always, enjoyed a movie made for kids with enough entertainment thrown in for adults. It appears that kids and parents go through the same things, regardless of the planet. Found myself laughing most of the way through, especially when my boyfriend leaned over and said 'you know this is a movie for kids, right?' I guess I'm a kid at heart and this movie was very enjoyable. Loved seeing who played which characters at the end. I only recognized one during the film, but was pleasantly surprised by the rest! Maybe it was the holiday, but our theater was packed, and everyone seemed to walk away having enjoyed the show."

Escape from Planet Earth,Featherweight children's entertainment,"Much like the, certainly better, ""A Cat in Paris"", the generically titled ""Escape from Planet Earth"" inhabits the lower bounds of what can be considered a theatrical release. Essentially, the movie is Sesame Street's Earnie and Burt were aliens from the planet Bob (spelled ""BAAB"") held captive on ""the Dark Planet"" (earth) by ""Dr. Stangelove's..."" General Turgidson (voiced by the incomparable William Shatner) with predictable outcomes. Dissimilar from similar recent children's cartoon fair (""Monsters vs. Aliens"", ""Hotel Transylvania"", etc.) the film does not contain referential humor and smart asides aimed at the supervising adults or the brighter little nippers. The film does contain all of the color and motion you would expect from bringing to the kids to see the ""Madgascar"" series and the soundtrack here is actually slightly superior as it relies less on 1990's dance tunes (yes, there is the requisite dance number at the end that all the animated characters - whether they survived or not - participate in). In short, wait for this short, empty calorie trifle to make it to pay-per-view on your cable box for a fraction of the cost."
Escape from Planet Earth,Simply Entertaining,Comentario no disponible
Escape from Planet Earth,A refreshingly simple family flick.,"Along with bird flick Adventures of Zambezia, this animated alien escapade has been stuck in the large shadow cast by Dreamworks' The Croods this school holiday period. Which, frankly, is completely expected, yet also a bit of a shame. Escape never soars to great heights, in fact it's happy to just coast along in second gear for the most part, but there's a simplicity and lack of self-knowingness to it which is uncommon for family outings these days, making it somewhat refreshing. There are very few pop culture winks and nods, and even less gags for adults, with the focus predominantly on crafting a fun, and funny, film for the kiddies. The animation is noticeably cut-price, the story is unoriginal and the voice cast is a who's who of of C-grade talent - Brendan Fraser as the dimwitted hero, Rob Corrdry as his brainy brother, William Shatner as the nefarious human villain, plus Sarah Jessica Parker, Steve Zahn, Jane Lynch and Craig Robinson to boot - however the tempo is quick, the jokes are frequent and the action sequences are full of gusto; everything a little critter wants from a trip to the cinema."

Escape from Planet Earth,Escape From Mediocre Cinema,"You know, I might as well not review EFPE. There's so many story elements, characters and clichés taken from similar productions it'll just feel like covering old ground. So, in lieu of a proper write up, here's the sitch: * The main character is an alien egghead, who does a lot of strenuous work but feels unappreciated by those around him, particularly by his...

* Dumb but all-action brother, who receives all the credit for carrying out dangerous missions on behalf of their planet, despite most the success being down to his sibling's technological know-how.

* The egghead also has a plucky son, who idolises his uncle but thinks his dad is a boring nerd. I wonder if he'll learn a lesson by the end of the movie, or save the day. Maybe both.

* The eggheads wife is a former pilot with their planet's airforce, when she chose to give up her esteemed position to raise her kid. Guess who's skills are needed once again...

* Lastly, we have three captured extraterrestrial lifeforms introduced later on when the locale is transported to Earth... None of whom serves any purpose whatsoever and could easily be written out of the script all together.

If you can't figure out exactly what'll conspire to happen based on the above descriptions alone, you REALLY need to see more movies. It all moves as regular as clockwork... Even the JOKES feel rudimentary and rehearsed. That's not to say anything here is horrendously bad... In fact, I think children will love it.

To the weary adult viewer though, it offers little more than a few chuckles and a retread over familiar ground. 'Nothing Special' is the mantra here, I'm afraid. And I hope it doesn't get picked up by any interplanetary spaceships belonging to civilisations we haven't get encountered... Or we're ALL doomed... 6/10"
Escape from Planet Earth,"Decent animation, a few funny parts, but thats it...","Now I saw this movie twice before. It wasn't a success for me. The animation is decent however cheap and very boring looking, there might be some funny parts, but that's about it. The writing isn't very good, its not very exciting after a long time, its just forgettable. The characters are so horrible and annoying. It was made in 2013, home of some bad animation like this, Free birds, Walking with dinosaurs, and the unsuccessful Planes movie (I haven't seen it, but I've heard its pretty bad.) So overall, this film was mediocre and poorly written. So save your money and watch a better space movie like Star wars or Galaxy quest. They are both live action, and better than this. This is a film that should've been nominated at the Razzies, but wasn't Story: 2/10 Animation:4/10 Characters:2/10 3/10"

Escape from Planet Earth,Not bad being blue,"This animation is a fun story. Two brothers work make a team that captures the imagination, national hero of the blue aliens Scorch Supernova always comes in to save the day, with a perfect chin and teeth he is the hero to all. However, he depends on his nerdy brother Gary Supernova who is the brains behind the operation as head of BASA and seems to always be there when he comes a bit short In order to keep his legacy alive, Scorch decides to take a trip to the dark planet, Earth. He does so against his brother's wishes and discovers that it is tough being a hero solo. On earth the super hero falls into the hands of the evil military complex and gets caught up in a web of aliens and the technological slave trade. Directed by Cal Brunker, Escape from Planet Earth captures true, justices, and the toughest force of the universe, brotherly love. Lots of sly references to other space movies for example a Star Trek (1966) reference when in the 7-11, one of the clerks uses the Vulcan salute while hiding under the counter. There also is a scene going through some canyons that remind of the Star Wars seen on the death star. Another need reference is whenever two last names are said in succession, they match up with the names of famous directors, e.g. a Hazmat says: ""Peter! Jackson! Detain him!"" or ""James! Cameron! Don't let him get away!"
Escape from Planet Earth,"Good concept, but too childish, couldn't keep it going","The start of the movie is just another plot of typical alien films, but as you move on you see a difference. The heroes are aliens (for us!) and the humans are villains. I loved the concept but the film couldn't keep its zeal; the action was vague and too immature. It seems like the film makers wanted to target the youngest age group, but even though should have put the better part of their thinking into it. Films like toy story and ice age enjoy similar themes, but there is something in which they differ from Escape From Planet Earth- Quality of action!

To summarize I would insist you better try other films of this kind, like monsters vs aliens"
Escape from Planet Earth,Low grade animated film,"Despite voice work by Brandon Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rob Corddry, William Shatner, Jessica Alba, George Lopez, Jane Lynch, Sofia Vergara, Ricky Gervais and Steve Zahn, ""Escape From Planet Earth"" starts off with a clever premise that is quickly cut off at the knees by mediocre writing and animation. Filled with weak helpings of anachronistic in-jokes and puns, the script by Bob Barlen and director Cal Brunker turns the old invasion-from-outer-space scenario on its head by depicting it from the aliens' viewpoint. But nothing very interesting or clever is done with it, so we wind up bored for most of the duration. More lethargy-prone five-year-olds might be entertained by it though."

Henry Danger,Terrific Film,This is a brilliant film for all fans and viewers to watch and enjoy. The crew did a splendid job in creating this film. I enjoyed watching most of them returning for this film. The storyline of this film was fine enough and had enough direction all the way throughout this film. The cast selection was terrific. They deeply committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry that was really displayed throughout this entire film between the cast members could have been a bit better and stronger but it was alright enough. All of the cast members have improved a lot in their careers. Ella Anderson was fully spectacular as the antagonist. I would gladly be turned into a vampire and be on her side.

TV Henry Danger was a great character for kids and this version is just bad in every way.

The effects of the movie are in line with the television show (with maybe a little bit of an upgrade.)"

Henry Danger,Nostalgic Comeback That Feels Good,"This is the long awaited film about Henry Danger and I feel it is worth the hype. The series has been a staple of my childhood and it's good that it actually got a feature length film. The end of the original show has left plenty of room for Henry's story to continue and this definitely was the continuation we deserved. It focuses on Henry's journey now in Dystopia and getting entangled with a super fan. It does have some feel of the original but a little more serious. Seems to have matured with those who grew up with the original series (like I did). Thundermans Return had the feel of the original Thundermans series but doesn't feel like it matured with those who grew up with the original series. Henry Danger the Movie does seem to be emotionally tense at times and leaves you sitting at the edge of your seat, feeling like a couple two parter episodes of the original show. It does have some multiversal themes to it as we see a couple versions of the characters that aren't like what we've come to know. It does seem to tease a future installment. I like to see another film or two with more of the original cast of the original Henry Danger returning with everything we saw in this. This comeback does feel good!"
Henry Danger,Oh boy!,"I'm going to start off by saying that I'm not a fan of the Henry Danger Show that aired on Nickelodeon. I did like it as a kid, but it is one of those kids show that hasn't aged well for obvious reasons, so when I heard about this movie, I knew it was going to be bad. Well, I just finished watching the movie and it was just as bad as I expected it to be.

Positives for Henry Danger: The Movie (2025): I can see fans of the show having some dumb fun with the movie. That's all I have to say for the positives.

Negatives for Henry Danger: The Movie (2025): The main plot of the movie is really dumb to where it felt like someone from Paramount was scrolling on the internet, found someone's dumb fanfiction and decided to convert it to a movie. The characters are just as stupid and nonsensical as they were in the show. The villains are laughably terrible where I could beat them with a single punch. The dialogue is cringe worthy and feels like a first draft. And finally, the movie ends on a note that teases a sequel or new tv show that will be just as stupid as this movie.

Overall, Henry Danger: The Movie (2025) was clearly not made for me especially since I hate the original show and while I understand that it was made for kids, I've seen kids movies and tv shows that scan be for adults and kids."

The writers should've done a better job of explaining the backstory. Not everyone knows these characters and storylines.

The soundtracks used in the movie are also excellent, as are the action scenes, which are wonderful. The end of the movie suggests that we'll see more Henry Danger projects in the future. 10/10.

Henry Danger,The movie was sooooo good (better than expected),"Ever since I heard there was a Henry Danger movie coming out, all the way back in 2018. I was so exited, even though I had to wait 7 years lol. The CGI was incredible and I liked how they had some aspects from the show and put it into a superhero movie. The movie added some new characters like Missy and Coach Greg which was nice. Charlotte bring in the movie would have made it a little more like the show but I'm not complaining. The movie gave Henry more of an adult view which showed him being more of the superhero. Only thing I didn't like was some of the jokes, didnt hit the same as the show but idrc. 10/10 must watch."

Henry Danger,Best movie it helped relive my childhood 😅😅,"The Henry Danger movie is definitely a 10/10, and here's why. As someone who watched the show, the movie brought back everything fans loved but made it even bigger and better. It had action, comedy, and emotional moments that made it fun for everyone, whether you were a fan of the show or not. First of all, the movie stayed true to the show while also giving us something new. The show was always funny, exciting, and full of great characters, and the movie gave us even more of that. Captain Man and Kid Danger were as amazing as ever. Their jokes and teamwork were so fun to watch, and their bond felt stronger than ever. It reminded fans why they loved these characters so much, but it also showed them growing and facing bigger challenges. It felt like we were seeing a new side of them, which made it special. The story of the movie was another reason it was so great. It didn't feel like just a longer version of an episode-it felt like a real adventure. The stakes were higher, the danger was bigger, and the villain was actually really interesting. The action scenes were exciting, but there were also some twists that kept things surprising. The movie also had emotional moments that made you care about the characters even more. The pacing was just right, so there was never a boring moment, and it kept you hooked the whole time. One of the best things about the movie was how it worked for everyone. Fans of the show got to see their favorite characters and fun Easter eggs, but new viewers could enjoy it too because the story stood on its own. It was the perfect mix of old and new, which is really hard to do, but they nailed it. In the end, the Henry Danger movie was everything fans could've wanted. It was funny, action-packed, and even emotional at times. It showed how much effort was put into making something that would make fans happy, and it's a movie that will stick with them for a long time. It's easy to see why so many people loved it-because it was just that good."

Jasper and Henry's friendship is special and it was perfect that it took center stage for this production.

Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated,FEELS GOOD!,"Fans of the show have been waiting for a Henry Danger movie since 2017 and it's finally a reality. After waiting so long, I really didn't know if the project was really going to meet my expectations. However, after watching the movie, I can confirm that Henry Danger: The Movie is made for fans of the original show. It's an incredible experience and has much better special effects than the series. The soundtracks used in the movie are also excellent, as are the action scenes, which are wonderful. The end of the movie suggests that we'll see more Henry Danger projects in the future. 10/10. Feels Good!"

Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated,The movie was sooooo good (better than expected),"Ever since I heard there was a Henry Danger movie coming out, all the way back in 2018. I was so exited, even though I had to wait 7 years lol. The CGI was incredible and I liked how they had some aspects from the show and put it into a superhero movie. The movie added some new characters like Missy and Coach Greg which was nice. Charlotte bring in the movie would have made it a little more like the show but I'm not complaining. The movie gave Henry more of an adult view which showed him being more of the superhero. Only thing I didn't like was some of the jokes, didnt hit the same as the show but idrc. 10/10 must watch."

Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated,Best movie it helped relive my childhood 😅😅,"The Henry Danger movie is definitely a 10/10, and here's why. As someone who watched the show, the movie brought back everything fans loved but made it even bigger and better. It had action, comedy, and emotional moments that made it fun for everyone, whether you were a fan of the show or not. First of all, the movie stayed true to the show while also giving us something new. The show was always funny, exciting, and full of great characters, and the movie gave us even more of that. Captain Man and Kid Danger were as amazing as ever. Their jokes and teamwork were so fun to watch, and their bond felt stronger than ever. It reminded fans why they loved these characters so much, but it also showed them growing and facing bigger challenges. It felt like we were seeing a new side of them, which made it special. The story of the movie was another reason it was so great. It didn't feel like just a longer version of an episode-it felt like a real adventure. The stakes were higher, the danger was bigger, and the villain was actually really interesting. The action scenes were exciting, but there were also some twists that kept things surprising. The movie also had emotional moments that made you care about the characters even more. The pacing was just right, so there was never a boring moment, and it kept you hooked the whole time. One of the best things about the movie was how it worked for everyone. Fans of the show got to see their favorite characters and fun Easter eggs, but new viewers could enjoy it too because the story stood on its own. It was the perfect mix of old and new, which is really hard to do, but they nailed it. In the end, the Henry Danger movie was everything fans could've wanted. It was funny, action-packed, and even emotional at times. It showed how much effort was put into making something that would make fans happy, and it's a movie that will stick with them for a long time. It's easy to see why so many people loved it-because it was just that good."

Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated,FINALLY! We cannot wait for another!,"We have waited forever for this to finally come out and even though I promised my 16 year old daughter I would wait to watch it with her, I couldn't help myself. We binge watched all the Henry Danger episodes leading up to yesterday. I have a few hours before the rest of my house wakes up. Maybe I will just watch the movie again then again when she wakes. I am ok with that. I cannot wait for another movie now. I can only assume there will be another due to the last few minutes of this movie. I have to say I am happy it ended the way it did. We will be impatiently waiting news confirming this and even more so impatiently waiting it's release!!"

Larry the Cable Guy: Remain Seated,Did NOT Disappoint!,"I was a little skeptical as it started. The storyline and the unexpected difference in Henry's personality at the beginning. It felt lacking outside of the entire cast and setting of the tv show, but as the movie unfolded it was very enjoyable to watch Henry learn his lesson and form new relationships. WE LOVE FRANKINI!!

Jasper and Henry's friendship is special and it was perfect that it took center stage for this production.

The ending was unexpected and... awesome... it was like being wrapped in a big hug! My daughter's and I have been longtime fans and hope that there will be further developments very quickly to continue the story!"

Women at War,Inaccurate but still good,"It's a good French series about the involvement of women in WW1 on the French side, through the prism of four prototypal characters: a prostitute with a son in the army; a runaway competent nurse; an upper-class lady with a shady past; and a nun.

The story of the four characters intersect and find a common destiny in a French town near the front, confronted by the horrors of war.

Some of that conflict was well depicted, other elements, maybe not so much. Historical accuracy is not the main element here (e.g there were no gas attack until 1915, whereas all the action takes place at the beginning of the war in 1914).

The depiction of war wounds, the moral of troops, the insufficient equipment (no helmet) and the treatment of the wounded seemed pretty spot on though.

The action and acting is all good if a little over-dramatic and forced at times.

There will be no second season. This is a mini-series and this is all there is to it."
Women at War,Strong acting but shmaltzy writing.,"I watched this in French w/ English subtitles, to best hear the actor's cadences for their role. From the beginning we had acting of the highest order, with (once again) Audrey Fleurot giving a standout performance, as she did in ""The French Village"". In fact all the acting was good to excellent. This leaves one with the impression that talent and craft are at the highest level with French Thespians. The production values were OK, though the battlefield scenes seemed lacking. But weakest of all was the writing: It was predictable with an inclination towards the melodramatic, and in some cases extremely so. This was an excellent example of superb acting almost elevating the production from so/so to good. Almost, that is."
Women at War,Masterpiece of episode,"This French miniseries brings us back in the beginning of the First World War between Germany and France. Many stories are packed here and lot of dramatic turns are shown.

The locations in the French Vosges of Alsace are beautiful. The costumes and sceneries were wonderfully created so that everything came very authentic here. The main actress and actors delivered an outstanding performance and should earn high respect inclusive the director.

The last two or three episodes were the best in my opinion when scene by scene was full of surprises and emotions. This war showed again how useless it is and how cruel it was during these war times. God bless all innocent soldiers who died for their country. 7/10."
Women at War,Very enjoyable,"I didn't have high hopes for this show when it popped up on my screen, but it turns out it's pretty addictive. Tells the tale of four women in various stations in life interacting and intersecting each other's lives in the early days of World War One in France.

This is a very well made series, good acting, writing, great costumes and sets. The show has a melodramatic, slightly unreal aspect to it, making for a dreamy high end soap opera feel. That's not a bad thing, it was low key mesmerizing at times.

I wish there were more miniseries of this caliber available on streaming services instead of the usual garbage shows."
Women at War,Great French WW1 soapie.!,"This show makes for compelling viewing thanks to extraordinary acting, beautiful scenery & sets with overall high production standards.

Even though the villains (most of the male characters) are often too evil to be real, the actors are so good at making us hate them that they somehow seemed quite believable though disgusting. The 4 female leads are very good-looking, appealing women caught up in such dire situations that it was easy to empathise with them, hoping one day they'd eventually find joy. Music soundtrack was good - always helping the story reach emotional highs. Compared to most of the tripe dished up as must-see-entertainment this one was GOLD!"
Women at War,Another great French soap period piece,"If you watched ""Bonfire of Destiny"" you'll be pleased to see the same three actresses ( plus a new one) and Director, at it again. This time it's 1914 and WW1 has started. A prostitute, a nun and a ""criminal"" abortionist are the main protagonists. And, yup the baddies are mostly men. But it's played out dead seriously which allows the plot weaknesses to be smoothed over.

Audrey Fleurot leads the way with her wonderful mane of red hair. And flaring nostrils! She's so good at playing strong characters who are always interesting even when flawed.

It's also one of the rare movies that show WW1 before it ground down to bunker warfare. It seems the French uniforms were ""decorative"" while the Germans, practical as usual, were colorless. Zut Alors!"
Women at War,Terrible in a good way,"I want to focus on the fact that this serie really catches the horrible moments of war in such a way I think noone can go away untouched. The screams are just horrific, If I didn't know it was on TV I could swear it was real.

I have to say it's really well made, great acting from everyone. And the fact I finished this before even thinking of looking at the last of us says it all.

This isn't an American production where everyone is cool and wounds are no match.

France has done it, it's horrific and tense, but you just need to watch to the end. Not sure you feel any better, but you definitely feel something."
Women at War,Disappointing ending but what a wonderful story!,"The different stories are interesting and not farfetched. Most of the actresses and actors are excellent. The four main characters are so different from one another, what makes the story even more captivating. I binge-watched it and loved it... until the end of the episode 6.

The last two episodes were indeed very disappointing: they lacked realism and were sickly soppy. Example: would it be possible that a high-ranking officer, at war, receives a prostitute in his office and helps her, several times? Finally, the end is just unrealistic and too sentimental to me.

What a shame as it is a super story showing the great value and capabilities of different women during wartime."
Women at War,Entertaining historical drama,"If you like historical series with beautiful cinematography you're going to like this.

Acting is great, the characters are likable and it has a good storyline. Maybe that there are too few episodes to really develop a connection with all of the characters.

I also noticed that all of the main characters are very beautiful which may not be realistic but on the other hand all of them are great actors so I don't mind,

I especially enjoyed the first 5 episodes, the last episodes were a bit unrealistic and ""American"" with some cheesy lines and dramatic music. Especially since I prefer European series over American, who tend to be too much of everything for my taste. But overall it was an entertaining well made series and I finished it in two days!"
Women at War,Too much fantasy,"The female combatants are beautiful and play well, although sometimes their expressiveness is exaggerated.

The war scenes are naively rendered and unbelievable. The scenes with all those wounded and mutilated soldiers moaning and wrapped in bandages, would not be true, something is false and artificial.

The plot is too thick, too many coincidences, too many events exaggerated and broken from reality. No president of a country comes to the place where fighting is going on, on the front line, to decorate four women, one of whom is a prostitute. Yes, a prostitute, but who has a wonderful mother's soul.

The series keeps you captive, you are curious how it will end, what will be the denouement, it is exciting from this point of view, but much of what happened is not believable, there is an excess of coincidences and situations, which have no real support and seem inappropriate and illogical, defying reality. Too much fantasy."
Women at War,10 out of 10 for a French prod!,"This french mini-series has it all: the storytelling, the acting, the pace, the actors, the production, the score, the camera.

Being from Luxembourg, I know what I am talking about, as I followed MANY other french series.

I cannot and do NOT wish to spoil ANYTHING about the plot: discover it for yourselves and get surprised.

Of course, it is a HUGE advantage being able to watch it in its original FR-version.

Hint: it is not for the faint of heart.

Enjoy it simply. I binge-watched it within 1 day and a half.

I gave it a straight 10 out of 10, which is EXTREMELY exceptional.

Superb success for my French neighbors, period."
Women at War,Melodramatic attempt to portray women's experience of war. But does it honour ordinary women?,Comentario no disponible
Women at War,Soap opera with very little realism,"Silly sentimentalism and flagrant absurdities. I am on episode 6, so I cannot say that I watched the whole series, but after episode 3 already, husband and I already felt that the coincidences, the crowding of off kilter characters and seesaw events signaled a poorly cooked soap opera plot that unfortunately destroys the otherwise laudable efforts of production. Solid actors, great costumes, gorgeous photography and decors, but the characters are cartoonish, the dialogues often clichés (I speak French, but my husband does not: we are watching the show in French with English subtitles.) and anachronisms abound in this ridiculously pompous stew. A FRENCH VILLAGE, the WW2 French series whom some reviewers compared this show to because of the presence of Audrey Fleurot in both shows, is far superior on all fronts: realism, compelling characters and a believable plot. This Women At War thing is simply not believable -period."
Women at War,Thank you. Or should I say merci.,"Acting is superb. Cinematography and scene staging is excellent. Storyline is good enough to be engaging. Nice to see a quality series that isn't from the U. S. And while the dubbing isn't the best its adequate. Thank you. Or should I say merci.

Women at War,Could have been better,"Poor writing and over use of melodrama ruined what could have been a fine production. The plot, as in ""Bonfire of Destiny"" - which also starred Audrey Fleurot and Julie de Bona - was extremely dense. It was unrealistic and some of the coincidences were really excruciating.

There was a lot of fine acting. That really saved the series, and I have to admit that having got to about half way, you really wanted to know how it ended, so it does hold your attention.

However, as the story progressed, the melodrama became steadily worse. Also the heroic achievements of the women leads became too far-fetched."
Women at War,Tres Bien,"Absolutely fantastic!!! A great story line and well organised. The story flies beautifully with all four main female characters well cast and evenly featured in the plot, a very difficult thing to achieve.

I loved it; entertaining, interesting and emotional these attributes are superbly blended to achieve this most wonderful series.

I binged watched it I could not resist. Thank you for your story, it's portrayal and englightening presentation. Thank you for excellent casting, acting and sheer brilliance. I've not enjoyed a series like this in a long time, my deepest sincerest gratitude to you all."
Women at War,Well done but...,"This is a French movie set in the early part of World War One. You can tell it's a French film because it is somewhat biased against the Germans but so am I and I'm not even French. Mainly, what I wanted to mention was that you can tell this was written by a woman. All but 3 of the men characters are some level of bad and many are despicable. That being said, the acting is good for the most part. The writing is decent. It has some historical chronological flaws. The costumes and vehicles give an authentic feel to the movie.

Some things were predictable to me. I can't mention which without a spoiler alert. It was still worth watching. I give it a marginal 7 stars."
Women at War,Fantastic and well worth the watch.,I'm not always one for watching a series with subtitles (as I don't speak French) but this series was well worth the watch. The characters as individuals were absolutely fantastic and as the series went on their stories intertwined showing how small the world actually is but also how divided it can be! There's lots of history behind people my age and we all tend to read the parts that make up the small parts but this show tells us the story of how women in an age where they were far less thought of came together and showed how good their strengths are. It's a fantastic show and a great story from a completely different perspective than the history books. Well done all involved. Just sorry there won't be a second series!
Women at War,Enjoyed it but the American dubbing was annoying,"So, the series itself was quite a good watch, I find anything WW2 really interesting, I think the show was well put together, acting was fine. So it was pretty good overall.

The voice overs were matched pretty well so that made for an easy watch too

The bit that ruined it for me though is the fact that both French and Germans were dubbed with American accents .. that's really annoying because it didn't give the show much dynamic/ variation and sometimes was confusing knowing who was who.. so when you've got a German and a French person talking to eachother, they are both sounding American. It's a bit weird."
Women at War,Great flick!!,"I really enjoyed this show. It portrays war time struggles really well. I was disappointed that the issues they showed the women facing were extremes instead of everyday issues the majority face. It focused on abuse in the Catholic Church, the effects of outlawed abortion, prostitution, crooked men and lesbian relationships causing issues with the front lines of war as opposed to tearing young men away from families for war. Women are able to win battles without being lesbians, whores or weak given in to manipulation. Of course then it wouldn't be an exciting show I suppose, or we'd have to get more creative than the norm these days."
Women at War,About to start but my concern is why are,"The four principal actors all facially attractive? A random selection of four people in any town or village is unlikely to produce four glamorous faces. If we are to be invested in at least some degree of realism let's have historical drama look real. There are further consequences related though to the film and television industry more generally. To what extent are roles given on the basis of showreel only for auditions in the first place? With thousands of aspiring actors struggling to live adequate lives, their Industry continues to adopt the Hollywood model of selection. And we know how that can turn out."
Women at War,Lavish production,"Money was spent on this. Sets were excellent, costumes were authentic, location was fabulous. There wasn't a ""cast of thousands"" but the extras must have cost a fortune.

There was no way that this was not going to turn into a melodramatic telenovela or soap opera though. Our four principal women were virtuous against a world of wickedness. They were fighting not only the Germans but evil men and women on their own side.

Coincidences abounded, secrets were found out, confidences betrayed. But we knew how it would end up - everything would turn out well in the end for our heroines. It simply has to in this sort of series.

Did I hate it for that? Absolutely not. I followed it all through.

I watched in French with the help of English subtitles as I'm going a bit deaf. I don't think this programme could possibly work at all with dubbed American accents."
Women at War,Stunning Series with Great Acting and sets,"This French miniseries was fantastic.

The main characters drew you in from the start, 4 great actresses who made you care what happened to them and whether they would survive. Each of the protagonists had a detailed and interesting storyline

The directors did a great job of showing the chaos of the early months of the war, the French solders only had cloth caps at this point, not helmets - and the front line in the forest was very fluid, all very realistic The beauty of the country and forested Alsace region that they were figting over, combined with the stunning uniforms of both sides and attention to detail provided a great spectacle.

There is a lot more to this series that could be told, please make a series 2!"
Women at War,A Civilian's Perspective on WWI,"Following the success of films such as 1913 and All Quiet on the Western Front, Netflix took a chance on a WWI French limited series (8 episodes) that follows four Parisian women in 1914 France as their lives intersect - Marguerite, a Parisian prostitute (Audrey Fleurot), Suzanne, a feminist nurse (Camille Lou), Agnes, Mother Superior of a convent (Julia De Bona), and Caroline, a house wife propelled to command her husband's family factory (Sofia Essaidi).

The miniseries covers the waterfront on tone - melodrama, love, lust, depravity, immorality, graphic violence, reversals of fortunes, reversals of misfortunes, hopes, betrayals, plot torques, and sufficient intrigue to add this series to the suspense genre as much as it sits squarely in history and drama.

The performances by the four female leads were unflinchingly nuanced, as were the performances by the equally compelling ""lead"" male cast ensemble. Cinematographer Jean-Phillipe Gosselin used his full tool box with every type of shot, angle, lighting and color saturation choice, and mis-en-scene. Laurent credited creator Cécile Lorne with the designs for the fascinating characters and noted that, while the characters were fictional, the crew included two historians (Laurent also kept military advisors on the sets). This series differentiates itself from most war films in that it is a portrayal that starts with a civilian perspective.

This series had little marketing and is currently Netflix's number 2 or 3 show in the US as of today by word of mouth. It is a definite recommend. My only criticism is of the last 5 minutes of the entire series - it was way too melodramatic, and I did not like the writers' choice for the fate of one of the characters. The other 6 hours and 47 minutes are well worth the watch. @netflix."
Sword Art Online,"Great first half, unfortunate second half.",Comentario no disponible
Sword Art Online,Not a masterpiece but worth to watch,I would not call this anime a masterpiece but it really is something. Surely there are better anime's out there. But if you like game and vr stuff then it's totally worth your time. I watched all 4 season. I didn't like season 2&3 that much. But season 4 was a beast. As the release date is out I am waiting for season 5. Although I think it's overhyped but you can enjoy.
Sword Art Online,Instantly Hooked,"With the help of a friend, as well as Sirlionhart's Let's Play of Hollow Fragment, Sword Art Online became the first Japanese Anime that I got into. Closest things to Anime prior that I watched were Avatar: The Last Airbender (Some don't really consider it anime as its American, but its based off it) and if you count movies, Spirited Away. But back on topic.

After my friend showed me game-play of Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment, I decided to check out the series on Netflix and I was instantly hooked. It was humorous at times, very deep and emotional, and really epic. The characters are likable, the story is amazing, the music, score and theme songs, awesome.

I understand that a lot of people don't like the show, and I see the reasons why. I was disappointed when the First Story Arc came to what seemed like a sudden and rather quick end (Which is the reasoning behind me not giving the show a perfect 10 score). I honestly wouldn't have had a problem with different Story Arcs if the first season had focused on just one (Much like ABC's Once Upon a Time, because I think the Story Arcs were rather good.

But overall, I am really glad that I got into the show. It may not be perfect, but I liked it and I really look forward to Sword Art Online 3 as well as the movie (that is, if they have officially been announced rather than rumored)when they come out."
Sword Art Online,Pretty Decent!,"In the year 2022, thousands of people get trapped in a new virtual MMORPG (Mass Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) known as Sword Art Online. Where death normally causes you to respawn to a safe zone, Sword Art Online was reprogrammed to kill anyone who dies in the virtual world. The only way to exit the game, is to defeat the final boss. Eager to escape this virtual nightmare, a lone beta player called Kirito fights his way through each floor of the game; however, this lone wolf soon recognizes the need for companionship, and the cost for his freedom. In the end, SAO Season 1 was packed full of mythical virtual excitement, beautiful animation, wonderful orchestral pieces, and intriguing character development. Even if you never watch SAO Season 2, SAO Season 1 is a must see for any Anime enthusiast and deserves a solid 10.

Sword Art Online Season 2, brings us back to the mmo virtual world. However, unlike SAO Season 1, the first half of SA0 season 2 is primarily based on a gunslinger motif known as Gun Gale Online,

In a virtual world comprised of guns and bullets, Kirito, uses a female avatar whilst duel wielding a violet energy sword and a 5.7mm FN Five Seven handgun. Not long after his experiences in Alfheim Online, Kirito is asked to assist in finding a mysterious player called Death Gun who is targeting the best players in the game, and is some how killing them in the real world.

Though we reunite with some familiar characters in the past, GGO introduces a sexy sniper named Sinon who uses a PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II which is a .50 caliber anti-material sniper rifle. As awesome as this season has been, it does lack a few of the intense emotional elements that made the first season so amazing. (Ex: The romance that developed between Kirito and Asuna, or the intense rage Kirito expressed to certain members of Laughing Coffin)

Upon the conclusion of SOA season 2 mid-season finale, we are brought back to Alfheim Online where we are reunited with everyone in Kirito's party from SOA season 1. After a brief 4 episodes, the remainder of the SAO season 2 focuses on an entirely new guild known as the ""the sleeping knights"" guild. In a desperate attempt to achieve the unachievable ""the sleeping knights"" request Asuna's help after assessing her combat skills in a duel against their strongest member Yuuki.

Growing up on anime, I have seen my fair share of classics, but the beautiful atmosphere, the breathtaking music, and the fantastic character development has quickly made SAO my favourite anime series. That being said, those who were a fan of SAO season 1 will notice an almost different atmosphere in SAO season 2. Personally I feel that SAO season 1 was better because the second half completely fed off the first half of the season. However, SAO season 2 had what appeared to be 4-5 parts. Although this introduces us to new characters, the plot felt a little scattered as it lacked the kind of consistency and the emotional build that was provided by SAO season 1. Overall, the second season of SAO was not fantastic, but I still believe it deserves a 7."

Sword Art Online,How does this get such a good reputation,I finished the first two seasons now and I'm actually wondering how this show got its good reputation in the anime scene. I mean the first 6 or so episodes were entertaining and I was curious how it all plays out but as soon as they leave the soa game the show just got stuck into a boring love story and doesn't really seem to get out of it at all. The fights are mediocre and the characters are very linear and flat written. The world building doesn't really exist after the first few episodes and the story overall just isn't really exciting I feel like. I probably won't watch the next seasons since my expectations aren't really that high.
Sword Art Online,Overhyped but good,In the overall anime I think it's overhyped. But still I enjoyed it though.2&3 season was kinda gloomy to me but season 4 was a beast. Most of all what I like the most in this anime is kirito and asuna's love story. Everything is good but my main motivation is kirito x asuna. You should probably give it a watch.

Sword Art Online,"Wow, just amazing.","This anime is Amazing. Watch it now. I can't even explain this... Sword Art Online is ridiculously well made, so far. A lot of anime have a good start but end horribly but this anime has an incredible start and only time will tell of the end. However, I believe that this anime will finish very well. I don't want to reveal much about the show but the main character Kirito is awesome... Just go watch this show. Now. You wont regret it trust me. I don't know if I'll be able to survive waiting a week for each episode. All I have been doing so far is praising the show but I'm dead serious the characters are awesome, plot is awesome, the idea of the show is very interesting as well. I HIGHLY recommend this show and I know this isn't the most detailed and persuading post (I don't wanna spoil anything), at least I don't think it is but this is a very good show. You will get hooked from episode 1, I promise. My brother and I aren't crazy anime fans, we probably are now because of this show but he saw someone post on a website that an amazing new show is going on air and well, he was right."

Sword Art Online,Perhaps the most overrated anime of all time.,Comentario no disponible
Sword Art Online,Great anime series,"So far I've seen the first dozen of episodes. It goes without saying that this anime is very beautiful and with strong memorable characters. I was hesitant at first to watch this because of the video game theme. But it's a very mature show for what is contrary to what it appears to be in first glance.

Teenage boy Kirito gets stuck in a futuristic MMO game and together with other players in his situation they have to beat the game to be set free or die in the real world.

It's not the typical action packed anime, although it could turn into another Naruto/Bleach/OnePiece of ridiculously overpowered action heroes, I think a better description so far would be a tragic romantic sci fi show. I can't remember when I've seen so many characters die in an anime in such a short succession.

Anyway don't miss this, I'm glad I didn't. There are very few animes these days that make me want to see forward for the next episode."
Sword Art Online,Anime made for RPG gamers.,"Well I have to say, this has got to be the hardest anime to review and rate that I have come across so far. It is one hell of a mixture. But I did had a great time watching it, was very entertaining and that is what really matters.

On the plus side, I loved the setting/premise, a world where virtual reality has been perfected and MMORPG's truly come to life. The RPG gamer in me was really happy while watching this anime. DAMN I wanted to be in SAO so bad. The animation was great, especially that of the action sequences. I loved em. Coupled with amazing soundtrack, they really became epic. Protagonist was very likable and cool. The heroin was hot. :p

Now on the bad side, the anime felt really rushed in the beginning. It actually felt like I skipped an episode couple of times. Would have been better if they stretched out the first arc into 24 episodes or so, would have been much better. It got a little too much lovey dovey too later on, which was off putting. The side characters were good BUT they got very less screen time, way too less. It was like the anime forgot about them. And then there was the second arc. It didn't suck as bad as many said it would but still it was nowhere near as good as the first arc. IT just didn't had the same feeling as the first arc. The setting in it was cool, had a lot of Final fantasy vibe to it. But the love stuff was lame and pointless.

As for the rating, well I would give it like:

First arc (1-14 episodes) 8.8/10.

Second arc 6.5/10.

Overall, despite its flaws, I somehow still found it to be very enjoyable and was engaged in it a lot. 8.3/10."
Sword Art Online,Watching this is as crucial to your existence as learning how to breathe!,"This anime was nothing less than a masterpiece (and, believe me, I don't throw that word around lightly). I'm not a gamer and yet I found every aspect of SAO appealing: the special skills, the slightly complicated workings of the VRMMORPG(s), the character designs...everything was top- notch. While the idea of creating an anime which focuses on characters playing a VRMMORPG isn't entirely new/original, I believe that SAO manifests the most flawless depiction of such a series.

From the onset of the anime, Tomohiko Ito intrigued me with a plot line so gripping and characters so relatable and admirable that I would undoubtedly watch every last episode of this anime. The phantasmagorical world that he created left me wishing that there was some possibility that it could be real sometimes and the love shared between the two main characters was so heart-rending that it made my heart bleed. This anime illustrates the whole scope of human emotions/relations within a mere 25 episodes AND features quite a bit of character development. Furthermore, it presents a completely fleshed-out and fulfilled story which leaves no ""what ifs?""...it ties up all loose ends and then redirects to give you a look at the lives of even some of the minor characters.

This isn't just an anime...it's a true work of art! 100/10 You've gotta watch this! :D"

Sword Art Online,Amazing So Far,"I am actually watching this Show really late. Most of my friends watched it over a year ago but i have heard great things. I decided to watch it on HULU yesterday for the first time and i was hooked. I stayed up way to late and watched the first 10 episodes. The Reason why it was so appealing to me was it seemed like it was my life. I game daily its a part of my life and seeing this show where everything you do it real and has consequences just opened my eyes. I love all the characters from the good and bad. Great show i cant believe it took me this long to watch it. Give it a chance. Other shows i have watched and enjoyed...Inuyasha, Bleach, One punch man, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop that's just a few so you see what i watch in comparison and there is a 10 line minimum so just stretching this out a bit."

Sword Art Online,Deep and Engaging Story,"As most of you know there are light novels for this series, all of which I have read. And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages. The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between Asuna and Kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any RPGS or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the anime has covered a substantial part of volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed. The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.

As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played RPGS, and if you died in those RPGS, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the RPG becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging. I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his ""noob"" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or Manga. This anime will only be about 25 or 26 episodes long, covering just volumes 1,2, and perhaps some of 8 in the process, if it does well enough movies and ova's or even another season could be launched, allowing us to further immerse in this incredible universe.

And I'm sure by the time this anime is finished (or long before), everyone will be rushing to read the novels, and they won't be disappointed!"

Sword Art Online,"Over hyped and kind of stupid, but enjoyable nonetheless",Comentario no disponible
"Sister, Sister",Good,"Tia and Tamera Mowry play twins who were separated at birth and by chance meet each other in a shopping mall. Ray Campbell, Tamera's adopted father, is very different from Tia's adopted mother, Lisa Landry, but the twins don't want to be separated so Ray and Lisa end up living together. The series often focuses on the trouble the twins get into due to their identical appearance and the love-hate relationship between Lisa and Ray.

The verdict: I give it a final rating of 7 out of 10 because it's good but also kind of flawed. Everything about this series could make anyone laugh."
"Sister, Sister","Outdated, But Enjoyable Enough","There are two things that I hate to admit about this show. One being that there is a lot of things wrong with it, the other is that I enjoyed it despite its glaring flaws.

This show started in the early 90s, so take that as you will. The first thing I'd like to talk about, & the thing that I think is the biggest ""no-no"" for me in any form of media, is that this show depicts a LOT of toxic situations & relationships in the name of humor, as described below:

1) Roger's behavior, especially in the first couple of seasons, is WILDLY inappropriate. He constantly & brazenly makes overly sexual jokes & comments towards literally any young woman who has the misfortune of being onscreen with him, HE SNEAKS INTO THE TWINS' ROOM WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT, harasses the twins about going out with him in nearly every episode from seasons 1-2, & is always walking into the Campbell house without being invited, often inserting himself in things that have nothing to do with him, unwanted, (which apparently is meant to be a running gag, but I've never found it funny). His purpose is solely to be annoying, & he's not truly accepted into the plot until much later in the show, where he mellows out & not only becomes tolerable, but actually turns into any okay character.

2) The girls lie to their parents & act deceitful countless times throughout the entire series; it's like they're incapable of learning from their mistakes, despite having very caring parents who are fully willing to listen & teach them about right & wrong & the reasons why you shouldn't do certain things. They often find themselves in very dangerous situations because of this, but because the plot says so, they always turn out just fine.

3) (An extension of #2) The girls take a hella long time to start growing up. They go through a lot of life lessons throughout the series, but don't seem to retain what they've learned from any of them, & they literally whine & cry like small children when things don't go their way, even as they're older & supposed to be becoming more mature.

4) As much as I originally loved Lisa, (mainly because Jackie Harry is so dang funny), she also suffers from the character flaw of perpetual deceitfulness, forever manipulating Ray to give her money & basicly fund her entire life, because she's incapable of getting her dream fashion business off of the ground. She literally mooches off of him from day one, & only has a job for a very short while for a very specific plot point. Spoiler alert: it doesn't end with any character growth of her realising she should figure out how to take care of herself monetarily. & I know that it can be hard to find a good job, but Lisa doesn't even try, because she knows that Ray will continue to support her. This causes her jokes to start falling flat for me as the show goes on, because at least half of them are money-based.

5) The writers of this show love to throw in characters left & right, then act like they never existed in future episodes. The girls go through love interests like crazy, because apparently ""teenagers aren't capable of keeping relationships""??? There have literally been entire episodes based off the scenario of: there's a guy that one sister or the other really likes, comedic happenings ensue, but even if they end up together in the end, it usually doesn't even last into the next episode. They do the exact same thing with friends. Near the beginning of the show, there were two girls that the twins hung out with all the time, but they disappeared without explanation. Then, the show went a looooong time without showing that the twins had any friends at all, & suddenly in season four, three girls show up out of nowhere, acting like they've been the twins' BFFs the entire time. It's honestly so wild & weird, & confusing af.

All of these things make it seem as if I really didn't like watching Sister Sister. But, even though these are pretty big issues, imo, I still find myself going back to it. I'm currently on season four, & I plan to finish. Something about the show still draws me in; Tia & Tamera Mowry are decent enough actresses & it overall can get a laugh out of me, plus it's something that I can just put on & not worry too much about paying close attention. &, although I'm white, there's something about it being a nearly all-black cast that hits differently for me. I can't speak much on the culture & if it's being represented properly, but it's nice to see a talented cast in a decent show that isn't whitewashed to all heck."
"Sister, Sister",Pretty good sitcom 👋,My mum watched his back in the day and it holds up I just dont like jackie Harry as lisa
"Sister, Sister",Tia & Tamera are Fine!,"What *is* it with you people? Nearly everyone who has reviewed this show has blasted it beyond belief.

Yes - it was corny... it was a family show.

Yes - it was sacchrine and unrealistic... it was a family show.

Yes - it was ""The Black Full House""... it was brought in just as Full House was beginning to dwindle in the ratings, but it was more than that.

The simple premise of twin girls separated at birth by completely different parents and then brought back together under coincidental circumstances obviously proved too pathetic to most IMDb reviewers.

Twins Tia and Tamera showed promise - they fine actresses, both good-looking and both can sing.

Although Tim Reid as Ray was a drip, Marques Houston as Roger was great, while Jaquee Harry (Lisa) is an absolute legend! This was a good show, so don't be tryin' to tell me otherwise."
"Sister, Sister",I Used to Really Like This Show,"I remembering watching and loving Sister, Sister during its original run. Then I watched the series a few times after finding episodes on YouTube almost a decade ago. In my mid-thirties, I am noticing things that I never noticed before, maybe because of the natural cynicism that comes with age.

First, the good. I still love that the show is relatively wholesome. There is no jumping into bed among the teens like today's shows, something I really appreciate this since morals are in the toilet right now.

Now for the bad.

Tia & Tamera - I used to be impressed by black girls leading a show. Now, I think that their acting is not very good, but I really don't think it's all their fault. I haven't researched, but I get the impression that they were acting like inner city black youths according to the vision of white writers and producers. When that's the case, you have to work with what they give you. I also never noticed before how many boyfriends they cycled through before Jordan and Tyreke came along. That's a LOT of teenage dating, and their parents were okay with it. Outrageous! In real life, they would be having their own twins at the age of sixteen.

Tamera: I used to think that Tamera was funny. Now I think she is very annoying as she exaggeratedly says, ""Awwww maaaan!"" ignores her father whom many of us wish we had as kids, and wear weird clothing that kids did not really wear in the 90s (where I lived, anyway). But again, she isn't responsible for most of this as an actress.

Lisa: I used to love Lisa! She was funny, sassy, and down-to-earth. Now, I view her as a freeloader who manipulates Ray to basically take care of her and her daughter while she chases her dream in the first few seasons. It is not his responsibility to indulge in or finance her dream no matter how much money he makes, so her insisting that he do so on many occasions is hard to take. I could never imagine living on someone else's dime, and if I fell on hard times and had to stay with someone, it will not be for six years amd I would be sure to pay my own way. I also find that many of her jokes that I used to find funny fall short now. Also, I strongly doubt that an adoption agency would give a child to Lisa, who was so financially insecure that she could not afford a stroller for Tia for the first nine months.

Ray: I used to and still love Ray as a father. Boy, I wish my father wanted to be involved in my life instead of being too busy drinking liquor and watching TV. He isn't perfect, but overall he is great. He even put up with Lisa's mooching for his daughter's happiness. I really wish he would have found love and marriage by the end of the show. He's wealthy, a great dad, decent, and handsome. I think it's feasible for a good woman to be attracted to him.

Roger: I used to LOVE Marques Houston during the original run. That was seriously my boo! As an adult, I find Roger super annoying and overly interested in sex. I know about teenage boys and hormones, but he's way too open and vocal about it.

Tyreke and Jordan: No complaints about the boyfriends. They were great for the show and were hilarious! However, I don't think it's realistic to be as great as they were. Teenagers in talk life are much less considerate, serious, and caring, which is why must teenage relationships naturally end.

While I would not watch the show again, I still give it a 7 for the good times when I really enjoyed it."
"Sister, Sister",More Novel Than Funny,"""Sister, Sister"" is about twin girls who were separated at birth yet found each other years later as older girls. Tia and Tamera Mowry played Tia Landry and Tamera Campbell. Tia had been raised by Lisa Landry (Jackee Harry) and Tamera had been raised by Ray Campbell (Tim Reid). After the two met they were inseparable while Lisa and Ray had something of a relationship.

The show was more novel than it was funny to me. It had its moments but never truly found that ""it"" factor. I think it was able to survive on the cuteness of the twins and the novelty of their situation more than the quality of the script and the comedy value."

"Sister, Sister",Finally on netflix,Awwwww my this brings back memories of me as a kid growing up watching this show all the time.
"Sister, Sister",I miss this show!,"As an 80's child I grew up with all the classic cartoons like Ducktales, Gummi Bears, Thundercats and Ghostbusters then when I was in high school I had the shows like Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Kenan & Kel, Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Sister Sister. Watching these shows was something I used to really look forward to every evening and when they are shown in a rare repeat on TV I love watching and reminising.

Sister Sister had some great episodes. There was something about the mannerisms of the characters which I found just hilarious - I especially remember this of Lisa and Tamera. I remember we were also occasionally treated to the musical talents of Tia, Tamera & Marques Houston (Roger) which I always enjoyed. What was most pivotal about Sister Sister was that despite being a comedy show with the occasional unrealistic scenarios it did address many things teenagers go through and could relate to. The characters seemed like real people and I'm sure I was not the only one to grow up with and love those characters.

I don't know what people expected out of this show but to me like many other similar shows that aired at the same point as Sister Sister they were marketed at teenagers and young adults who appreciated them a lot. Most of these shows had around six seasons so they must have been doing something right! Personally I think this show was fantastic and I hope we get it on DVD soon :-)"
"Sister, Sister",Great show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this show! It is funny, and Tia and Tamera are great! I liked Roger best, 'cause he is incredibly funny as he worships the twins. The only thing I didn't like was the way they said things in unison, except when they said, ""Go Home, Roger!"" Jackee Harry and Tim Reid are really funny as Lisa and Ray! My favorite episode was the pilot! This is a great show for kids, teens, and adults to watch!!"
"Sister, Sister",Great!,This show is being watched by my grand children for the second time around. Their mother loved the show and a second generation is watching it. Does not matter how many times you watch this show it's funny and enjoyable. We love it a family show.
"Sister, Sister",Very American and Very 90s.,"""Sister, Sister"" is a great show for what it is, a family-orientated American sitcom. A lot of the situations are very corny, but isn't that the point? The show is very successful at what it does. This is not meant to be Shakespeare - it's a mainstream, easy going sitcom aimed at the Teen market.

I used to love this show as a kid. It's fun, innocent and the principle cast are all very likable. What more could you ask for? As a viewer from the UK, this show SCREAMED American culture, and at the time I thought that was pretty damn cool. Maybe it was the fact that everyone got to wear their own clothes in school, or that the girls' house is just so gorgeous - I don't know. The show is also a lot of fun to watch now because it's so damn 90s! That's an aspect of ""Sister, Sister"" I really enjoy, being a kid of that era.

Don't lay into this show too hard. What did it ever do wrong? It was an unpretentious teen Sitcom that gave a lot of viewers many laughs for the few years it was on. It was a likable show that had a great cast and if you would care to look at it objectively, good set design, lighting and an overall great look (It won awards for that) It's very 90's, It's very easy viewing, And I love it."
"Sister, Sister",sister sister is not stupid,"i can agree that the plot was a bit silly, and realistic but at the end of the day its TV. its not meant to be 100% convincing, nothing on tv is real.

The girls were good actresses i cant deny, and the pace at their age was stable, at least when they were 16 they werent all over boys like brianna is in 'one on one', it was a good show and it was long running. Roger playede by Marques Houston was the sweetest thing i had ever seen until he grew and his voice broke and he got all 'masculine' but hes still sweet anyway."
"Sister, Sister",My Favorite Show,"Ok, so it might be a bit corny, but isn't every sitcom?

It might be cliché, but come on, you are watching a sitcom!

This is my favorite show in existence and I love it so much."
"Sister, Sister",This is a unique and fun show that I never get tired of!,"First, I want to start off by saying that I love this show! I think everyone knows that Sister, Sister is about two twins that were separated at birth and find each other at a local mall. First of all, many people might say that this show is unrealistic. It's not unrealistic, it's unlikely. Twins separated at birth has happened many times! Anyways, Sister, Sister is a very fun show. It's the kind of show that doesn't happen anymore. I didn't start watching this show until it came on Disney Channel. I've loved it ever since! No matter how many times I see an episode, I never get tired of it! I think it's a show that everyone could find something they like it. I think it's hilarious and very enjoyable! If you haven't seen this show, I highly recommend you watch!"
"Sister, Sister","Good show, i miss it!","Well i thought it was particularly good. The average age of the audience for this show were young teenagers and i doubt they are really looking for an emmy award winning performance. It was nice seeing the sisters grow up through the years and in my opinion it had everything that a family show needs - laughter, hot guys like ronreaco lee and marques houston and it was packed full of interesting scenarios so on the whole-good entertainment!!"
"Sister, Sister",Fav show growing up in 90s!,I think deserves better ratings than it got. Brings me back to my childhood. Lisa was the best! Wish there was more series!

"Sister, Sister",It's still cool!,"I remember watching this show from the night it debuted on ABC. Tia and Tamera are both good actresses and it was fun watching them grow up on screen. Jackee Harry and Tim Reid had a lot of chemistry too, as the complete opposites Lisa and Ray. It's a shame they didn't end up together for good. My favorite episode has to be where the twins got their temps and Ray and Lisa tried to teach them to drive, and another good one is where the same boy unwittingly asks both the twins out on the same night thinking they are one girl. They both end up going on the date, and it's also the same show where Lisa meets Terrence! It was a good, decent family show, although I think the ABC episodes where better than the subsequent WB ones. Hats off to the cast and crew for a fun show and a job well done!"

"Sister, Sister","""Sister, Sister"" - A wonderful show thanks to two delightful stars","I got my first glimpse of the antics of twin sisters Tia and Tamera Mowry, strangely enough, in my 8th grade health class; we were in the middle of the seemingly state-mandated and (clearly) pointless drug and sex education courses. We were forced to watch the episode where Tia and Tamera give into peer pressure and start smoking in the school bathroom; it's real life issues that made ""Sister, Sister"" genuine in its hayday.

This was about five years ago and I hadn't seen the show since, until this summer. Though it's immediately proceeded on Disney by ""That's So Raven,"" it makes for one of the best hours on children's television in my opinion, even though I'm 18 and have long since given up on today's children's programming.

""Sister, Sister"" is funny in a way that's mature and adult without being too tacky or silly; a lot of today's kid's programming is idiotic toilet humor and is therefore complete crap. At least when I was growing up in the early 90s, we had cartoons that were genuinely funny and intelligent; if anything else, you might have actually learned something from them.

I've watched several episodes and I'm amazed at how great a show about identical twin sisters can be, that it's funny, touching, AND intelligent - all at the same time and without selling its soul. ""Sister, Sister"" was entertaining for these very reasons and I'm sure that's why it lasted for as long as it did on television.

It's a great show, and one that I hope is released on DVD soon so that it can be experienced to its greatest."
"Sister, Sister",A memorable sitcom,"Sister Sister really takes me back to my life in the 90's! It was a unique show which went from strength to strength, with a simple formula, good plot lines and very strong character types. As enjoyable as Tia and Tamera's characters were, for me personally, the unparallelled Jackee Harry took the show to a new level as the sassy and brash Lisa Landry. Much like her lauded performance in 227 in the 80's, Jackee managed to steal show here as well.

My only complaints are the drop in quality of the show in the final season as well as the fact that the finale was extremely rushed and didn't have a particularly great ending."
"Sister, Sister",Last series let it down,I grew up watching this and absolutely loved the earlier seasons. I kind of wish they had ended it when they left high school. I found myself not paying attention to the season when they were at college and not caring as much about what they did. It feels to me it just turned into how many celebrities and parties can we fit in
"Sister, Sister",fantastic show,"I totally agree. I think Roger is funny because he annoys Tia and Tamera, he's probably my second favorite character other than Tamera. I love Tamera, I can totally relate to her because I love to dance and dance and stuff. ""Go home Roger"" is a classic line. Ray and Lisa are funny too, especially since Ray likes opera music and owns a limousine service, not to mention Lisa designing her own clothes. I like a lot of the episodes, but my favorite one is probably... well I can't think of any right now, haha but today on Disney Channel was an early episode when Tia and Tamera are celebrating their birthday and spend a weekend in Chicago(where I'm from!!) Except yeah, I would agree that its a bit cheesy when they say the same lines together. Tamera rocks!"
Polly Pocket,,
Ratched,,
Elite,Getting worse and worse,"Oh God this series turned out ridiculous.. The more seasons come out the more characters become annoying. All of the good characters and actors left/were written out of the show, obviously they can't be high school students forever.. always the same situation and the same problems, someone always has to die.. and their acting skills are literally funny I rated the first two season 8, but after s4 and s5 I've modified 5-6 You know, people should know when to stop something."
Elite,Guilty Pleasure,"S1 to S3 were great but S4 is a major letdown. It seems the characters suffer from amnesia because they keep repeating the same mistakes followed by illogical actions which follow such mistakes. Like I for one couldn't understand how characters just betray, forgive and forget so easily only to repeat this cycle countless times. ""It was just sex"" the characters make the relationships sound so insignificant with this dialogue and to top it all this statement does work as an excuse. All in all it was fine initially but now it's gotten on my nerves how stupid the characters of this show are."
Elite,Started amazingly but became rocky from the fourth season,"Season 6

There's been a noticeable decline in this series from the fourth season, and season 6 isn't any different. It's a series that has genuinely overstayed its welcome, and this is very evident as none of the original cast is present in this season. The jaded plot stumbles and pirouettes with no flair, and tries to make up for it with more dancing, drinking and substance taking. Many societal issues are raised, but their executions are perfunctory and superficial.

The twist to the season's whodunit was well-done and the season's ending is a frustrating but clever cliffhanger, promising that more harm is coming to Las Encinas. With season seven on the way, I hope they can return with the charm the first three seasons delivered and come up with a satisfying end to the series."
Elite,Really impressed,"I've already finished; the series premiered this morning. I think that it's really interesting drama, with many intrigues.,interesting characters (you may recognize people from your life), beautiful scenes. Actors are really beautiful and talented - generally young people acting so professionally. Story itself is really provocative, once you start, you can't stop, that's how I finished it in less than 24 hours and I am already hoping that there will be season 2.

I have to say that they have used some really good songs.

Well, I think it's a nict show to watch.

Thank you Netflix !"
Elite,What happened to the writers?,"Season 1 & 2 were great and all characters were great and lovable.

Season 3 wasn't as good but still, it had some great moments to it and didn't drift away from the purpose.

Season 4. I was like what? Is this another show with the same actors? Were the writers out of ideas and just wanted a sequel? And what's with the barrage of unnecessary s!x scenes ? There was no chemistry whatsoever with the new characters.

Major Let down really.

I hope that by some miracle they manage to revive the series in season 5.

Thanks."
Elite,"Give us more European teen shows like this, please!","Good acting. Beautiful setting. Some cliché tropes that are actually used in an original way, and some twist and turns I definitely did not see coming. The characters are believable, they have depth and weaknesses and aren't adults doing adult things while telling the viewer they really are sixteen (unlike shows like Gossip Girl). I loved the European groundedness of it, there's a realism to this show American teen shows never seem to possess. I've been surprised plenty of times, I'd definetely recommend, also for the older viewer who likes a good murder mystery."
Elite,Disappointing,"Season 1 and 2 have a great story behind and you get hooked up to the show. Drama, love and thriller embodies every single episode.

Season 3 lost the magic. It seemed that they just wanted to produce, just to produce and feed the hungry consumers. Somehow season 4 removed the last bit of hope there was, for the serie to come back up."
Elite,Well done!,"Honestly I loved it! The acting is amazing compared to other teen series of sort of the same genre like Riverdale, Pretty little liars and Gossip Girl,wich we all know the acting is puke worthy. What I didn't like was how they expect us to see all of these ""teens"" with overly active sexual lifestyles that not even an adult could keep up with,I get it they're young and wild but it's just not believable. Other than that totally would recommend."
Elite,"Overall, great, but I have a problem with the script.",Comentario no disponible
Elite,Started entertaining but became a soulless sex show,"The series began interesting but after the first season it became more and more a soft porn. The story was over so they tried to catch up the viewers by nudity and sex- sex sells. This makes me mad because I really enjoyed the first season. It had social criticism, generation conflicts, gender related discussions, racism etc. During the time all of these topics disappeared. Elite could be such an amazing show but they ruined it."
Elite,"I love this show and the characters so much, so so much.","Season 3 is the absolute best so far, so many moments where I was genuinely surprised and speachless, and everything is so smartly done, you get so involved with the chatacters and love them with time, really one of the best shows of this type I watched !"
Elite,Spanish Gossip Girl Whodunit,"Solidly entertaining for what it is. Think every tenn show you've ever seen and add a dash of the Affair or How To Get Away With Murder. It's melodrama through and through. Pretty teens. Uncaring families. Poor little rich girls and boys. Even poorer poor kids. Nobody is happy in this world. Somebody winds up dead. Somebody's going to jail. You find somebody to love you'd better hang on tooth and nail. The wolf is always at the door.

It deals with some real issues: notably Islamaphobia and the repressive nature of fundamentalism, coming out of the closet, open relationships and threesomes, HIV and the seeming impossibility of reinventing yourself in highschool. All hormones, no autonomy. Such is life.

Well worth a binge watch if you're stuck inside on a rainy day. You won't find yourself transfixed but you will want to know what happens next. The writing felt a little stale but of course translations and voiceovers don't always capture the rhythm of the original dialogue. Still something tells me the writer isn't Spain's answer to Shondre Rhimes or Aaron Sorkin."
Elite,Lost it's spirit with season 4,Comentario no disponible
Elite,Very slick.,"Elite is a very well made drama series, the production values are incredibly slick, and the acting is truly great. If you're able to watch it in its native language with subtitles I would advise it, as the English dubbing really doesn't work, it becomes a very distracting watch, same as with The Rain. The first episode is great, it does get a little slow for a few episodes, but then picks up very nicely. It's a binge watch I really enjoed. 8/10"
Elite,"Although fun at times, this show is incredibly over-dramatic, unrealistic and superficial. Emotional moments have very low stakes and are forgotton within mere seconds.","Season One: 6.5/10

Themes: Drama, High School, Crime, Relationships, Lgbtq+, Islam, HIV, Suspense, Privilege, Murder, Sexuality, Mystery, Love Triangles & Spanish.

Top three characters: 1) Ander Muñoz, 2) Carla Rosón Caleruega and 3) Omar Shanaa."
Elite,Just why....,"Why did they spoil it? I actually loved Season 1 to the point i keep watching it non stop. Season 2 and 3 were also great but i liked them less than 1.

But suddenly they decided to destroy the entire series with Season 4 and 5, OMG these two seasons are terrible to be kind , poor contents , annoying characters and predictable endings were mainly what made them so unwatchable.

Now i hope the creators will make a great season 6 even though the majority of characters are missing , but i have doubts.."
Elite,Good Enough,"First Season : pretty good. The story was build up smoothly, adding more suspense as the mystery was being unfolded, with a solid soundtrack, nice performances and the air of gossip girl. Second Season : Okay Not bad, but not as good as the first one. Nice addition of new characters and smooth character development. Third Season : Try hard Boring and like a bad version of the first season. Tried hard to shock and make things scandalous and edgy, but did not succeed."
Elite,Loved it!!!,"Addictive, I could not stop watching even if I am not a teenager anymore. This is what I ask of tv products, to entertain, and this one does the job incredibly well. The cast is great!"
Elite,Seasons 1-3 excellent! Then stop watching,"Look how they killed my boy 😭. The cast & storyline for seasons 1-3 are just great. I loved the show until they released season 4... it just goes so downhill. I'd recommend anyone to watch the first 3 seasons. It's not worth it after that. The cast changes & the story changes.

There's not a whole lot more to say than that. I guess I'll try fill out the character count for a bit longer.

Oh yeah, the whole plot of seasons 1-3 is really good and it is a genuinely engrossing mystery. And once the characters work out who carried out the murder, it's perfectly frustrating to watch them be unable to prove it. Loved it."
Elite,Everything went downhill after season 3,"I absolutely loved the first 3 seasons of the show. Season 4 was already a disappointment and season 5 is an even bigger mess in my opinion.

Everything is just way over the top. The characters have no real depth and are annoying too and the storylines, which aren't even executed well, are beyond ridiculous.

Also, what's with the sex scenes? I'm always here for intimate scenes but there's something sexual going on every 10 minutes which is so unnecessary. Sometimes less is more.

This is not the Élite i've come to enjoy anymore."
Elite,Amazing,"I love it. Every season is getting better for me, so many conflicts. In season 1 and 2, Carla turned me on but in season 3, not very much :( Every new characters make this serie getting better"
Elite,Season 6 review:Far Worse than the OG(1-3)far better than the other 2(4 and 6,"You know what you about to see when you start this series...Its a guilty pleasure,you WON'T see emmy award performances or screenplay but you cant denie that the first 3 seasons was a decent 7 7,5 show... Interesting characters decent screenplay with quite good suspense and basically something completely knew that broke all taboo of todays sexual orientation...Its for anyone,HELL NO...Is it some time TOO MUCH...Oh HELL YES..But as i said season 1-3 was decent...I dont want to speak about season 4-5 because all they did is wanted to bring some taboos that dont even exist just to shock the viewer...And thats what makes season 6 be at the decent seasons...There is no over the top relationships and surprisingly none of the relationships of this season irritated..At least not as much as the previous 2 seasons relationships did...I dont know whats next for Elite but after the ending and the apparent departures that the ending of the season hinted im not so curious to know."
Elite,Should be ended on season 3 as Season 4 is boring,Really it was good till season 3. I would give 8 stars to the story and mystery. Season 4 is just a crap there is no story at all. They just stretched it without any story and mystery.
Elite,"Beautiful people, nice plot.","One of my favorite Spanish series. The actors & actresses are all beautiful, their acts are great. The plot is good, although I still love Season 1 the most. How they change partners reminds me of Gossip Girl, with similar settings of high-end & low class highschool students."
Elite,Ludicrous but watchable tosh,"I've seen all four seasons. It's pure escapism and I enjoyed it. It is not true to life - no set of people could be so wicked.

Just some impressions. The majority of the frocks are the most dreadful I have seen. The snazzy clothes worn by the lads are equally ghastly. The women playing lesbians were clearly not up for the job - the kisses and embraces were obviously fake. However, the guys playing gays brought verisimilitude to their roles and looked like they were true to life - they were kissing properly and what appeared to be passionately, unlike the female actresses. I have never seen so many hunky lads and attractive women in a series. Surely not all rich people are beautiful? Even the parents were stunners for the most part.

I assume there will be a season five. I shall certainly watch it."
Exhibit A,Realistic depiction of descent into mental illness,"This is a found footage film that deviates in that there is nothing supernatural in the eeriness of it. Tale of a family with typical secrets except for the father who descends into his madness. What follows is a realistic depiction of mental breakdown. Slow burn to the end, and a sad end it is. I have nothing to do with this film or anyone with the production. Just a psychologist in America who happens to like these types of films."
Exhibit A,Too Awful,"In this movie, a young girl videotapes her family as they get ready to move into a new house. Things seem pretty normal at first, but things begin to change bit by bit. At the beginning of the movie, I had a hard time sitting through it because I really disliked the characters (except for the girl filming). The second half of the movie is supposed to be cringe-inducing because of what begins to happen, so it was slightly easier to follow. However, some moments late in the film were almost too upsetting for me--the sort of thing that you wish you didn't have in your memory and makes you question what you seek out for entertainment. I was especially caught off guard because I missed the evidence tag that is shown just before the home movies start. I did like the fact that this was a found footage film written as realistic fiction instead of introducing supernatural elements, but the fact that something like this could really happen bothered me more."

Exhibit A,A Masterpiece Of Gradually Escalating Horror!,"Strengthened by compelling performances from its faithful cast, making extremely effective use of its camera to capture all the unfolding drama, and steadily escalating its gradually- building tension over the course of its runtime, Exhibit A is an excellent example of smart, gripping storytelling that also goes down as possibly the most underrated work of its genre.

Set in Yorkshire, Exhibit A follows the day-to-day activities of a normal family that is driven to the unimaginable due to the pressure of their current financial situation. We witness the whole set of events through daughter Judith's video camera, which are set in motion when her dad hides a secret from the family which ultimately leads to devastating consequences.

Co-written & directed by Dom Rotheroe, Exhibit A is crafted with thorough understanding of what it needs to be and the way each segment combines with the next to make road for the chilling finale is truly admirable. Another key aspect that this indie horror ends up nailing is something that most of its counterparts tend to skip over, and that's the attention provided to its characters.

The scripted characters are pretty much like your neighbours next door. The cast portraying them makes them all the more believable, with Brittany Ashworth & Bradley Cole impressing the most in their respective roles of Judith & her father. Where the former brilliantly exhibits the sensibilities of a worried daughter, the latter steals the show with his skillful rendition of a father undergoing a complete mental breakdown, which is unnerving to watch at times.

On an overall scale, Exhibit A is a first-rate example of escalating horror that implements its found-footage style in a riveting manner and is absolutely deserving of a broader audience. An edge-of-the-seat thriller capturing the disintegration of a normal family brought upon by financial pressures, Exhibit A is one of the best offerings of its genre that amplifies its tense ambiance amazingly well to culminate with a final segment that's just as heartbreaking as it is utterly disturbing. An underrated gem. Highly recommended."
Exhibit A,Angel,You can see the signs of what's supposed to happen but it was executed well. The ending still gave the unsettling/disturbing feeling.
Exhibit A,Clever,"A middle class family man doesn't get the big promotion he's been talking about for days, but now that his wife is ready to move to the dream house he promised, feeling she couldn't handle the truth, he tells her he got the job... which starts a hellish chain reaction.

I like that concept, one lie that starts an endless series of lies, burying the liar each time a bit deeper. Classic yet effective when it's well done, like here.

The main character is well written. He's an annoying unfunny guy who tries way too hard to be the party boy he's not, which we all find despicable in real life, so it feels good to see him sinking. On the other hand, he didn't mean any harm when he first lied, he was just scared of his wife's reaction and acted on that impulse, so you feel bad for him. You both hate and pity him, that's very clever.

It may not be a masterpiece but it's a good movie."
Exhibit A,A grim and realistic look at a fall into madness.,"Exhibit A is a tough watch. It's a disturbing and harrowing account of a father's mental decline into insanity, that works extremely well because of it's realism and great performances.

A chilling, heartbreaking, but effective film."
Exhibit A,good but sad and tragic,"I watched this and was engrossed until the last ten minutes. Then I was overwhelmed and just sad because this is the same sad story that seems to be in the news daily.

The movie was very well written and does accurate display the destruction of one man and his family. It is serious and to the point and brutally honest. It's ""found footage"" and it could be your neighbor or relative,which adds to the horror of it.

While I do recommend this be forewarned especially if you have ever experienced a tragedy like this. I find it incredibly sad, I can't say that enough, that things like this movie occur every day in real life. I find it more horrific than movies like Saw or Hostel."
Exhibit A,The real horror,"This movie came as a suggestion on this very website while I was reading the page of another movie (you know, the usual ""users who watched this movie also liked...""), and I'm really glad I yielded to the curiosity of reading what it was all about. I liked some ""found footage"" films in the past, but I'm not crazy about the genre, still I was triggered by the scarce plot given here, and I just decided to watch it. Now I'm just through it, and I'm still in shock.

The first scene is a police label marking the footage we are about to see as found on a murder scene, so there is little to spoil about the plot. The impending doom of those we are about to meet is made clear from the beginning, only leaving in doubt about who is/are the victim/s and who is/are the murderer/s.

Then it all begins...

This film could be split in three parts, all of which last about half an hour. It takes some patience to get through the first one, as most of what we see is some obnoxious family games and shallow chit-chat, which serves the purpose of building the context and getting to know the characters. So, we soon come to learn that we're dealing with a somewhat clumsy, but warm and caring father, seemingly a good house man all in all, but with the hint of a shadow looming over him (which will be developed later in the film), a tender, over-sensitive daughter kind of confused with herself, a mother who appears to be steadfast in her familiar role, but a little too stiff and bitchy, and an obnoxious son who is in his teens, but mostly behaves like a second grader or so to the rest of his family and in his leisure time. That is, a believable portrait of every day reality in your neighborhood: a perfect surface with its natural, human flaws. Oh, woe is me, will it not last...

In the second part, the secret shadow looming over the father begins to disclose, and we start witnessing his descent into weirdness first, and madness consequently. The dis-functionalities of the family, up to that moment quite dull and ordinary, quickly swirl down into a pit of ever growing frenzy, leading to the final showdown, which unravels in the third part.

I won't spoil anything about what goes on, but I'll just let you all know that this is not a horror movie, this is a dramatically realistic depiction of a well too known REAL horror.

The performances of the four main actors are stunning, the bond that grows between you and the characters is solid, real, you can feel it, touch it. As the story started developing, I found myself despising the boy, pitying the father, caring for the daughter, getting angry at the mother, and then having all these feelings just messed up and turned inside out as the events unraveled. But nonetheless, there was not a single moment when I was not feeling something for all of them. And I think this is one of the greatest achievements a movie can reach.

So, be prepared: you will be introduced to four people that you will get emotionally in touch with, only to be overwhelmed by the shocking doom that they will face.

On a final note: I stood astonished in front of my TV while the whole of the end credits silently rolled out and left an empty, black screen which lasted almost one minute, with no sound whatsoever. I just couldn't move away or stop the play. This is the level of the emotional grip this film has cast onto me.

You have been warned."
Exhibit A,"One of the better acted ""found footage"" films","The acting in this is terrific all the way around. Since most all FF films are acted out based on an outline and dialogue points to it, you see a LOT of cuts since the actors mess up their ""lines."" Not here. Other than the natural cuts from scene to scene, there is very little in-scene cutting, meaning the actors delivered and met their marks.

My only problems with the film are that I never really got a sense why the father fell so far from sanity. Many people have gone through financial struggles without losing their minds, and I never got the sense the father was on edge, mentally, to do what he does at the end.

And the ending simply went on too long. It was the one time when the film lagged when usually the end is when these FF films pick up and race toward the climax.

Overall, a really well done job all the way around."

Exhibit A,I wasn't expecting that,"This is honestly the most uncomfortable I have felt watching a film since watching Soft (2006). I am not usually fond of found footage films, but there are good ones and Exhibit A is as well crafted as it is mesmerising.

The story was pretty realistic for me, I have known people and families like that, and whilst this is not a horror film it was definitely horrifying. I disagree that the pacing was off, as it is clearly meant to be a slow turning of the screw. This will never get the recognition it deserves as no one in their right mind could ever recommend watching this because its that good at what it does."

Exhibit A,"Don't Know What Film Other Reviewers on Here Watched, But This Was Garbage","I am really shocked to see how many average to great reviews and ratings this piece of trash has. The majority must be associated with the film, or have never watched a good movie in their life. The premise sounded like something a little different in the found footage genre, but alas, it was the same old story just with different characters. Not only do the characters devolve during the movie, but so does the plot. It's like in the second half they completely forgot what was established in the beginning of the picture. The acting was over-dramatic, especially by the parents, and lacked any believability. The story and direction spiraled downhill faster than the disintegration of the family unit. An utter waste of time, even if you're a found footage fan."
Exhibit A,Organic found-footage shocker,"The timely story of a normal family disintegrating under financial pressure, eventually driven to the unimaginable. We witness the terrifying events unfold through daughter Judith's video camera, which subsequently becomes Exhibit A.

This film is a slow burning nightmare about real life financial struggles that anyone can relate to. Not many found-footage films are executed in such a realistic fashion as Exhibit A, the drama was raw, the deteriorating family at the center of the story could be the family next door, or even worse yours! The film is an extremely upsetting watch that I will never want to watch again, making it kind of hard to recommend something of such depressing magnitude. The film though stands as a testament that you don't need a large budget, well-known actors or an A-list director to create a movie that has such a powerful impact.

The performances were remarkable and were all too real, the actors made everything seem like a horrifying reality. Bradley Cole gives one of the most gripping, startling downward spiral of a family man since Jack Nicholson's performance from The Shining, absolutely bone chilling! Bradley plays Andy King, a seemingly normal husband and father of two who is a secret lie, which digs him and his family into the darkest side of human nature. Brittany Ashworth gives such a sympathetic and devastating performance that will grab your heart. Brittany plays Judith King, the lonely, shy, with a fragile soul that is confused sexually and may be in the closet. Judith basically documents every moment of the family's day-to-day life, as a result she discovers the dad's damaging secret and his disturbing change in behavior. Angela Forrest gives such an earnest performance; she plays an everyday mom Sheila King, who is excited about her husband's promotion that leads them to put a down payment on beautiful beach house. Aggressive sparks fly when questionable things start to unravel and hidden secrets come to light to disquieting results, an all too late realization for the wife and mother. Lastly, Oliver Lee who plays Joe King, the jokester son who begins to butt heads with his father and starts to truly hate him. He was kind of the comic relief of the film and you relate to his character as he can be you or someone you know, making the last moments all the more horrific and lingering.

Writer, Director, Dom Rotheroe has created a timely, ripped from the headlines, distressing story that happens to be a found-footage horror. He connects with the audience, grabs their souls and throws them in the heart stopping realism of financial woes, which takes a normal father in a downward, sinister direction of the most unthinkable. This was surprisingly a very well made found-footage film despite its limited budget, though a very harsh and sad film that will ruin your day. It was like you weren't even watching a movie, but more like watching evidence at a murder trial, kind of similar to the real life case involving John List of 1971. Nothing you enjoy watching but too absorbing to stop. It's a shame that he hasn't made any other movies since this one, which was released back in 2007. The film deserves more recognition than what it got because it's one of the very few found-footage films that has a lasting impact.

Overall, this film will haunt you to the core, as the drama is all too real. The performances were compelling and heart shattering and the story were raw and have relevance. The last couple of minutes will traumatize you and will make you sick, a film you won't want to return to but definitely gets it's point across. Rent with caution! 6.6 out of 10"
Exhibit A,Gripping Thriller-Drama,"The movie takes a while to get going, the thriller portion only starts near the end, the beginning being more of a family drama. Regardless, it was a pretty good one, despite the very shaky camera, the actors were all very good and it felt like a real family dealing with their problems. It's a pretty average film overall, but the end is definitely tense and surprising..."
Exhibit A,Tears of a clown,"When his family says they've had enough, a prankster dad gets serious. Dead serious.

Shoe-string found footage of a family's descent into the abyss. The camera work is chaotic, and often so poor that I began to sympathize with the critics of this genre who suffer motion sickness just by looking at the screen. And yet the dynamics and the emotion come across as raw and immediate, qualities that might have been lost through competent cinematography.

It does stick to the pure form of FF, with a minimal framing device in the title and notice at the very start; all the music and sound effects are diegetic; and the setting and dialogue are banal. A few passages where the presence of the camera is implausible, but few FFs overcome that problem entirely, and it's nothing some security camera POVs wouldn't have fixed (Dad could have splashed out on them after the intruder at the party).

The only other thing to note is the performance of the father's role - very effective in delivering a character who is odious yet likeable.

Overall: Raw material made interesting by the central character."
Exhibit A,"""It's All Going To Be Fine!""...","When teenager Judith King (Brittany Ashworth) inherits her dad's old video camera, she starts filming right away. As time goes by, we are made privy to some family business, including their being in the middle of selling their home, in order to buy a new, much larger one. The more Judith films, the more intense the situation gets, going from a happy, light atmosphere, to something much darker.

Judith has discovered that dad (Bradley Cole) seems to be hiding things. Judith's ""home movie"" turns into evidence in her investigation, revealing secrets that threaten to destroy everything.

EXHIBIT A is one of the better ""found footage"" horror films. Like all in this subgenre, the greatest problem is making the constant use of a camera look natural and appropriate under the story's circumstances. This works for the most part, with a few clunky exceptions. Each family member plays their part well, resulting in a believable situation.

This makes the finale all the more shocking and tragic..."

Exhibit A,A well-acted series of nothing. Avoid this movie.,"This movie was horrible; poor pacing, poor chronology, poor cinematography. Poor Script, horrible dialogue, crappy editing. It's just a hot mess from beginning to end. It should be avoided by everyone, even fans of the Found-Footage sub-genre. It is probably one of the worst FF films I have ever seen.

That being said, the acting in this is superb. Everyone does such a commendable job, from the parents to the supporting cast, that it is such a travesty that they were given this garbage to work with. It's unfortunate when talented people are resorted to this, but I guess something has to pay the bills.

I would go into more detail in my review, but I just don't feel that the movie is worth it.

FYI; Beware of glowing reviews, as they will most likely come from family and friends of the people involved in the making of this film."

Exhibit A,Ahead of it's time,"In 2007's ""Exhibit A"" we are introduced to a British family of four and we are experiencing their daily lives through the video camera of the daughter. It starts off relatively normal, but the fact that the family is under financial pressure causes some horrific events to happen. The premise is pretty simple and sounds intriguing and the found footage aspect gave the movie a scarily realistic feeling. It does take some time before it gets going but I think in the end it's worth it. The movie is not without its flaws however it's a solid watch and was certainly ahead of its time. If the same movie would come out now in 2024, it would be less effective but for a movie from 2007 this is an impressive piece of cinema. And I think that makes the movie even more enjoyable and interesting. It's an interesting approach to what financial pressure and the human psychology can do to Humans. [5,8/10]"
Exhibit A,It Wasn't Supposed To Happen...I'm Sorry,"This is a fun little movie about a family trying to sell their House....

+1 Star for when Dad starts uncovering secrets!!!!!

-1 Star for when the fire alarm is set off....no camera, night vision or not, is that invisible that close

I'm not really sure WHAT family member they are trying to paint in the most horrendous light here, all of them are pretty messed up. And likely one of them is about to snap.....

And Yes of Course one of them did.

I liked the movie. Nothing groundbreaking or anything but it was not shabbily done for a 'found footage' movie.

And the ending simply went on too long. It was the one time when the film lagged when usually the end is when these FF films pick up and race toward the climax.

Overall, a really well done job all the way around."

Sabrina,I wasn't expecting that,"This is honestly the most uncomfortable I have felt watching a film since watching Soft (2006). I am not usually fond of found footage films, but there are good ones and Exhibit A is as well crafted as it is mesmerising.

The story was pretty realistic for me, I have known people and families like that, and whilst this is not a horror film it was definitely horrifying. I disagree that the pacing was off, as it is clearly meant to be a slow turning of the screw. This will never get the recognition it deserves as no one in their right mind could ever recommend watching this because its that good at what it does."

Sabrina,"Don't Know What Film Other Reviewers on Here Watched, But This Was Garbage","I am really shocked to see how many average to great reviews and ratings this piece of trash has. The majority must be associated with the film, or have never watched a good movie in their life. The premise sounded like something a little different in the found footage genre, but alas, it was the same old story just with different characters. Not only do the characters devolve during the movie, but so does the plot. It's like in the second half they completely forgot what was established in the beginning of the picture. The acting was over-dramatic, especially by the parents, and lacked any believability. The story and direction spiraled downhill faster than the disintegration of the family unit. An utter waste of time, even if you're a found footage fan."
Sabrina,Organic found-footage shocker,"The timely story of a normal family disintegrating under financial pressure, eventually driven to the unimaginable. We witness the terrifying events unfold through daughter Judith's video camera, which subsequently becomes Exhibit A.

This film is a slow burning nightmare about real life financial struggles that anyone can relate to. Not many found-footage films are executed in such a realistic fashion as Exhibit A, the drama was raw, the deteriorating family at the center of the story could be the family next door, or even worse yours! The film is an extremely upsetting watch that I will never want to watch again, making it kind of hard to recommend something of such depressing magnitude. The film though stands as a testament that you don't need a large budget, well-known actors or an A-list director to create a movie that has such a powerful impact.

The performances were remarkable and were all too real, the actors made everything seem like a horrifying reality. Bradley Cole gives one of the most gripping, startling downward spiral of a family man since Jack Nicholson's performance from The Shining, absolutely bone chilling! Bradley plays Andy King, a seemingly normal husband and father of two who is a secret lie, which digs him and his family into the darkest side of human nature. Brittany Ashworth gives such a sympathetic and devastating performance that will grab your heart. Brittany plays Judith King, the lonely, shy, with a fragile soul that is confused sexually and may be in the closet. Judith basically documents every moment of the family's day-to-day life, as a result she discovers the dad's damaging secret and his disturbing change in behavior. Angela Forrest gives such an earnest performance; she plays an everyday mom Sheila King, who is excited about her husband's promotion that leads them to put a down payment on beautiful beach house. Aggressive sparks fly when questionable things start to unravel and hidden secrets come to light to disquieting results, an all too late realization for the wife and mother. Lastly, Oliver Lee who plays Joe King, the jokester son who begins to butt heads with his father and starts to truly hate him. He was kind of the comic relief of the film and you relate to his character as he can be you or someone you know, making the last moments all the more horrific and lingering.

Writer, Director, Dom Rotheroe has created a timely, ripped from the headlines, distressing story that happens to be a found-footage horror. He connects with the audience, grabs their souls and throws them in the heart stopping realism of financial woes, which takes a normal father in a downward, sinister direction of the most unthinkable. This was surprisingly a very well made found-footage film despite its limited budget, though a very harsh and sad film that will ruin your day. It was like you weren't even watching a movie, but more like watching evidence at a murder trial, kind of similar to the real life case involving John List of 1971. Nothing you enjoy watching but too absorbing to stop. It's a shame that he hasn't made any other movies since this one, which was released back in 2007. The film deserves more recognition than what it got because it's one of the very few found-footage films that has a lasting impact.

Overall, this film will haunt you to the core, as the drama is all too real. The performances were compelling and heart shattering and the story were raw and have relevance. The last couple of minutes will traumatize you and will make you sick, a film you won't want to return to but definitely gets it's point across. Rent with caution! 6.6 out of 10"
Sabrina,Gripping Thriller-Drama,"The movie takes a while to get going, the thriller portion only starts near the end, the beginning being more of a family drama. Regardless, it was a pretty good one, despite the very shaky camera, the actors were all very good and it felt like a real family dealing with their problems. It's a pretty average film overall, but the end is definitely tense and surprising..."
Sabrina,Tears of a clown,"When his family says they've had enough, a prankster dad gets serious. Dead serious.

Shoe-string found footage of a family's descent into the abyss. The camera work is chaotic, and often so poor that I began to sympathize with the critics of this genre who suffer motion sickness just by looking at the screen. And yet the dynamics and the emotion come across as raw and immediate, qualities that might have been lost through competent cinematography.

It does stick to the pure form of FF, with a minimal framing device in the title and notice at the very start; all the music and sound effects are diegetic; and the setting and dialogue are banal. A few passages where the presence of the camera is implausible, but few FFs overcome that problem entirely, and it's nothing some security camera POVs wouldn't have fixed (Dad could have splashed out on them after the intruder at the party).

The only other thing to note is the performance of the father's role - very effective in delivering a character who is odious yet likeable.

Overall: Raw material made interesting by the central character."
Sabrina,"""It's All Going To Be Fine!""...","When teenager Judith King (Brittany Ashworth) inherits her dad's old video camera, she starts filming right away. As time goes by, we are made privy to some family business, including their being in the middle of selling their home, in order to buy a new, much larger one. The more Judith films, the more intense the situation gets, going from a happy, light atmosphere, to something much darker.

Judith has discovered that dad (Bradley Cole) seems to be hiding things. Judith's ""home movie"" turns into evidence in her investigation, revealing secrets that threaten to destroy everything.

EXHIBIT A is one of the better ""found footage"" horror films. Like all in this subgenre, the greatest problem is making the constant use of a camera look natural and appropriate under the story's circumstances. This works for the most part, with a few clunky exceptions. Each family member plays their part well, resulting in a believable situation.

This makes the finale all the more shocking and tragic..."

Sabrina,Genuinely scary movie,"It feels kind of like cheating to even give any information about the plot to this. It's a found footage film that popped up suddenly for me as a horror movie.

Well it is a horror movie. And without spoiling anything, it's one of the scariest I've ever seen. No ghosts or demons or aliens or killer robots or killer dolls or cackling psychopaths with machetes. Just horror."
Sabrina,"Good first half, but takes a wrong turn and drags afterwards.",Comentario no disponible
Sabrina,A well-acted series of nothing. Avoid this movie.,"This movie was horrible; poor pacing, poor chronology, poor cinematography. Poor Script, horrible dialogue, crappy editing. It's just a hot mess from beginning to end. It should be avoided by everyone, even fans of the Found-Footage sub-genre. It is probably one of the worst FF films I have ever seen.

That being said, the acting in this is superb. Everyone does such a commendable job, from the parents to the supporting cast, that it is such a travesty that they were given this garbage to work with. It's unfortunate when talented people are resorted to this, but I guess something has to pay the bills.

I would go into more detail in my review, but I just don't feel that the movie is worth it.

FYI; Beware of glowing reviews, as they will most likely come from family and friends of the people involved in the making of this film."

Sabrina,Ahead of it's time,"In 2007's ""Exhibit A"" we are introduced to a British family of four and we are experiencing their daily lives through the video camera of the daughter. It starts off relatively normal, but the fact that the family is under financial pressure causes some horrific events to happen. The premise is pretty simple and sounds intriguing and the found footage aspect gave the movie a scarily realistic feeling. It does take some time before it gets going but I think in the end it's worth it. The movie is not without its flaws however it's a solid watch and was certainly ahead of its time. If the same movie would come out now in 2024, it would be less effective but for a movie from 2007 this is an impressive piece of cinema. And I think that makes the movie even more enjoyable and interesting. It's an interesting approach to what financial pressure and the human psychology can do to Humans. [5,8/10]"
Sabrina,It Wasn't Supposed To Happen...I'm Sorry,"This is a fun little movie about a family trying to sell their House....

As the process goes on...the Dad in the Family gets cooler and cooler!

Especially when they host a bar be que. Man that was awesome!!!

+1 Star for when Dad starts uncovering secrets!!!!!

-1 Star for when the fire alarm is set off....no camera, night vision or not, is that invisible that close

I'm not really sure WHAT family member they are trying to paint in the most horrendous light here, all of them are pretty messed up. And likely one of them is about to snap.....

And Yes of Course one of them did.

I liked the movie. Nothing groundbreaking or anything but it was not shabbily done for a 'found footage' movie.

5/10

Oh and as a sidenote....NOT A HORROR MOVIE!!!!"

Chip and Potato,Annoying,"My kids seem to like this show, but being an adult I find it kinda grating on my nerves. Everything is ""happy puggy pleasing"" or ""puggy perfect"", and the fact that the parents call eachother ""lil' mama"" and ""lil' papa"" is kinda weird."
Chip and Potato,Very cute,"Very cute, wholly inoffensive and deals with recognizable situations for little kids. Doesn't work on your nerves after 5 episodes like some other shows aimed at 2/3/4/5 year olds. Only real downside is the cutesy language. Don't watch if you hate cutesy nicknames. Or songs. Because there is definitely some singing. But hey, the kid likes the show and I haven't had the urge to throw a brick through the TV like I do with most other cartoons. So I'll deal with some cutesy language and bad songs."
Chip and Potato,"Preaches Inclusiveness, except for the mouse?",Comentario no disponible
Chip and Potato,Cute animals and fun for kids,"I stumbled on this while watching another show I've seen at least 6 times. So I thought at least this show isn't THAT one, right? The main characters are a family of pugs, all their names are based on potatoes. Chip has a pet mouse she keeps in her pocket named Potato. Everyone thinks Potato is a stuffed doll. The rest of the ""cast"" is filled with jungle animals. The episodes are about Chip and her daily adventures. While it's one episode there are several stories inside of it. On Netflix there's an entire season available. My 5 year old granddaughter really liked it. One part Chip start kindergarten, she gets roller skates and does chores. My granddaughter said ""she's just like me!"""
Chip and Potato,This show is annoying and teaches kids to save secrets with their parents.,"This TV show is awful, I hate Chip pug by next reasons: -She teaches kids to save secrets with their parents.

-She shows the zebras his mouse when they are moving in, but she says them ""promise me you won't tell anyone"" -She always says his mouse to pretend to be a toy plush.

And i hate Howie Hyena by next reasons: -He always annoys Chip pug that he makes me want to scold him.

-In one episode, when he goes restaurant, he steals Mr. Octopus a pizza.

Ok, I used to watch this TV show, i liked it, if you remember i rated this show 5/10, but i now hate it.

And i made a fanart where various characters scold Chip pug."
Chip and Potato,Adorbs,"The way the characters hang their paws, or when Little Mommy sniffs around the floor for her earrings is super adorable. I like that they have incorporated how the animals act into it, haven't seen that before. It's also nice that they included some diversity, like Nico's family being a single parent household (did they move there after the divorce? Who knows? I've over-analysed the show way too many times.) My son absolutely loves the show, and he's almost 3, so it appeals to younger audience with low attention span (including myself hehe). I must've seen the whole season maybe 15 times by now. So we're waiting for the second season and merch being released. Would love the outfits of the characters including Potato's hoodie, and pajamas, why isn't it available yet?!"
Chip and Potato,lovely,"Something does this serie irresistible. Not only for kids but for parents, uncles, aunts and the pets. Because it is less entertainment and moral lessons in the fair forms. Because it seems not exactly realistic but slice from near reality. Short, just a great show. Or the best recommandation for be owner of a pug or for not ignore a faithful very little friend."
Chip and Potato,Such a shame,"The sly indoctrination continues. I want to see the 2 gay zebras in nature produce a baby zebra. This is a very cute show with fairly calm animation but the far left in entertainment can't help themselves. If you're ok with the lies of the LGTBQWERTYXYZ123 crowd then by all means let your kids watch this. If not, steer clear."
Chip and Potato,Instant love,My child is apprehensive about new shows and watched this one from the start. She has seen every episode multiple times and still chooses it. It doesn't kill my soul to watch it with her either. Has good lessons without being in your face and seems to be inclusive of various situations.
Chip and Potato,Very watchable (and re-watchable),"We want more Chip and Potato! Season one ends on a cliffhanger to keep us adults wanting more. It's well thought out, with great lessons being taught (and learned). An enjoyable storyline that continues through from the first episode on, not just short stories that are 10ish minutes long. Adorable, likeable characters of all types making it easy for just about everyone to find a relatable character or situation. We have seen the entire 1st season at least a dozen times since we discovered this show on Netflix (June 2019) and I'm not sick of it yet. We began watching Chip and Potato with my 2 year old and now her brother's (7 & 10) enjoy watching it too. This show contains just the right amount of cuteness!"
Chip and Potato,A Show for All Families,"The beauty of this kid show is how inclusive it is. As a family living happily in modern times, it's great to see a kid show with LGBTQ* characters. Good job, good hearts. Thank you."
Chip and Potato,Very Cute Show,"We are big fans of pugs in this house, and I think it's just a really cute show. I love to see a show with realistic parents, siblings, and school. Sweet Chip befriends Nico the panda very quickly and makes him feel welcome at his new school which I think is awesome. However, I specifically wanted to say how GREAT I think this show is for its inclusivity. This new season has introduced new neighbors, The Razzles. A gay zebra couple raising their twins. I think that is just awesome! They introduced themselves normally and NO ONE made a big deal at all about their sexuality. That's how it should be! I'm really proud of this show for naturally including them. My youngest son loves to watch it and it's one of those shows I actually like to watch with him."
Chip and Potato,Wonderful,My daughter has always loved this show and we appreciate it's representation
Chip and Potato,Adorable show!,"Deals with many issues kids run in to, a lot of inclusivity and lovely characters. My 3 year old absolutely adores Chip & Potato!"
Chip and Potato,I love it!!!!,I really ❤d it!!!! This pug is Sooo cute!!!! Please let it get running!!!I ❤ this show😍😍😍
Chip and Potato,The pug won't stop talking so loudly,"THE PUG IS SO ANNOYING. My son HATES THIS SHOW HES ONLY 4 and he HATES THE PUG BECAUSE OF HOW ANNOYING IT IS!!!!!!!

#CANCELLED"
Chip and Potato,Amazing,My two year old loves chip and potato. It's cute and easy to follow without being repetitive my only complaint is that we discovered it after it's already been canceled so we have to rewatch the four seasons over and over again. With that being said it's actually to my surprise that it isn't annoying in a really a cute show. I really do not mind all the cutesy puggy speech because it's far and in between and really appropriate for the scene in which it's in. I like that the hyena is a little mean because it shows kids how to deal with real life situations where everyone may not be your friend or as nice. There is an aspect where the pug chip is keeping a secret from everyone about the mouth potato which is the premise of the show I don't believe it shows kids to keep secrets from your parents because it's more so on the lines of an imaginary friend...
Chip and Potato,quite literally saved my life,"I was seriously in a dark place when this show first came out on netflix, i wasn't really happy to be honest. I came home after a rough day decided to pop into netflix to watch whatever was on my watchlist till i saw this show pop up on my screen. I am a huge fan of cartoons especially with animals so my curiosity was peaked when i saw this small pug on my screen. I sat through the entire season in one go and i absolutely fell in love with this show's charm. Sure it may be """"""""too cutesy"""""""" for some people but i personally adored this from the start. I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters. Story. Colorful scenery. The songs. I really wanted to see this show grow n here we are now. Four ""seasons"" on netflix and words cant describe how happy this makes me."
Chip and Potato,Only watch this show if:,"1. If you want your child to understand that ""family"" can take on different forms. Different types of families are represented and normalized in this show and I LOVE that my child loves it.

2. If you want your child to understand the importance of community.

3. If you want your child to see a police officer (pug) that is so proud of being a hero, but throws on an apron when he gets home to cook and bake for his family. I don't think I've seen Little Momma cook in any episode (might be wrong) but I love that typical roles aren't so in this show! (I see what you did there with The Coolers!)

4. If you want your child to know it's ok to be different. They are all different animals so they don't have a choice but to be friends with each other AND THEY DO IT!

5. If you're a cool and hip grandma!! Cool and hip grandmas aren't represented anywhere but you are here!!!

6. That change can be good even if it feels weird at first.

7. Friendship! Friendship! Friendship! Friendship!!

8. We are all better together.

9. Chip is small but brave! My kid will likely be short so the world might look scarier for him. Any good examples of bravery welcomed in my household!

10. A kindergarten teacher at his best! I love that guy!

11. Love all the colors represented.

I appreciate this show so much. I'm glad it's the only show my 16 month old son likes. Love it love it love it!"

The Idhun Chronicles,As a book reader: Bad adaptation.,"Since no reviewer here seems to have read the original novels, I will try to my best: The Idhun Chronicles (or Memories from Idhun) is a fantasy trilogy, written by Laura Gallego (Spain). The original books are good, not perfect, but pretty good. But this adaptation is not worthy. It´s very difficult to explain, but I would say this is similar to the Avatar: the Last Airbender live action movie (the story is similar, but not quite. The characters are more or less the same, but at the same time they aren´t. It´s like all of the heart was taken away from this project). One of the worst parts is the voice acting: the author of the novels was originally involved with this series, she even casted a bunch of legendary voice actors for the show (the voice of Saitama in One Punch Man as the main character, professional voice actor Michelle Jenner (Hannah Philips in Toy Story) as the main female character... But the production company decided to fire all of them last minute, against the wishes of the author. And they casted a group of models, rookie actors and social media influencers instead (who never did any previous voice work), and it shows. Not only that, but this is the first animated product ever created by this production company. This not only lead to a lot of online controversy (since Laura Gallego was very open about her disappointment), but it also lowered the general quality of this show. My conclusion: You will only enjoy this show if you completely ignore the books, and you´re a BIG fantasy fan, but don´t think this represents the original story. There are a bunch of unique moments in the books that were slightly changed in this series, turning them into grey and generic (like the opening scene: I always thought the start of the first novel was pretty original, but in this series it was changed to the most generic main-character introduction ever). But to each his/her own."
The Idhun Chronicles,I wonder who thought this might be a success...,"If you don't like animation, this show is not for you. If you don't like storys written for children, this show is not for you. If you don't like shows getting somewhat bloody, this show is not for you. If you don't like fantasy, this show is not for you. And if you like all of the above? Then it's... okay. This show feels like it's made for children but somehow the creators thought the fights should be realistically brutal -- and didn't consider the consequences for the age limit (16 here in Germany). There are storys that look like they are for children, but aren't in a awesome way (e.g. Made in Abyss) but this is non of that. However, it has one thing going for it: It's fantasy. Not that it is particularly great, but if you really need a fantasy series and have no other left, you might give this one a try."
The Idhun Chronicles,Like a bad teenage show with its good parts,"Its like a child story with adult elements (blood, sex, to much badly written conflicting feelings). But it has its interesting different elements, even if there somewhat badly written. Could have been great but lacks in good dialogues and incoherrent story. So far im half way trough season 2 episode 4, almost stoped watching it many times"
The Idhun Chronicles,Don't waste out time with a part two,"Mediocre animation, bad voice acting by the main character, plot holes... and an ending that doesn't really wrap anything up. I'm not sure if the source material is better, but if it is, then the author must be fuming."

The Idhun Chronicles,"I like the theme, but it was a very boring animation to watch","I enjoy fantasy stories, the concept is good but this series makes a common mistake on this genre of story, which is trying to create everything, all the details, too much epic and on the result you get a confusing plot that is boring and doesn't fill the holes. The art backgrounds were good designed and painted, but when it comes to the animation itself, a lot of scenes are very bad linked, the animation isn't much smooth and character's acting was very weak and lack of any charisma to make them likable / interesting , still far from any good anime made by Japanese's company. The story is very slow pace and filled with boring cliche teenage drama and almost no action. If you are looking for a good epic fantasy animation, I would recommend a title like Trollhunters instead of this one."
The Idhun Chronicles,Childish script,Interesting story but poorly executed. Script is horrible and plot is rediculous.

The boy jake does not show real emotion if a girl that i liked had the audacity to kiss my parents murder i would kill them both and she is really ignorant this was something i was trying to watch cause i was bored but it got me pissed off and i didnt even want to watch it but i did so i could that trash off my continue watching"
The Idhun Chronicles,Boring bad story,I watched it all and all it was was an annoying slow moving horrific drama with little plot and no point. There was almost no action and the so called heros even after five episodes where just preteen crybabies and other then hold a so called heroic weapon did nothing of any importance. Just trash

Now I don't mind kid shows in fact I love plenty of them but being tv-14 and not having the more mature feeling I was hoping for was disappointing. This show had a lot of potential but it was wasted. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible but 5 episodes??? Anyways to wrap this up I don't recommend this show. I hate to say it but it was a waste of time.

The Idhun Chronicles,"The Most Childish, Whiny, Annoying, anime EVER!","Good grief this show was pathetic and predictable. I've never hated a main character so much as the ""whiny Jack"" who is undoubtedly one of the dumbest idiots to ever be chosen as the hero of the show. If you like whiny, annoying, entitled, petulant babies who lack all reason and small shred of common sense, this show is perfect for you. I've watched many anime series and had to turn this off due to the sheer ridiculousness of how much I truly despised how weakly developed the characters were. Especially the main character who takes it to a whole new level and made it impossible to root for him when he constantly complains like an unthankful spoiled brat. What a complete waste and your time is better spent watching paint dry. What a complete dumpster fire and hope ""whiny Jack"" gets the beating he truly deserves. This is the first time I actually rooted for the bad guys to prevail. This anime is a dreadful streak mark in the pants of decent anime."

The characters are more or less the same, but at the same time they aren´t. It´s like all of the heart was taken away from this project). One of the worst parts is the voice acting: the author of the novels was originally involved with this series, she even casted a bunch of legendary voice actors for the show (the voice of Saitama in One Punch Man as the main character, professional voice actor Michelle Jenner (Hannah Philips in Toy Story) as the main female character... But the production company decided to fire all of them last minute, against the wishes of the author. And they casted a group of models, rookie actors and social media influencers instead (who never did any previous voice work), and it shows. Not only that, but this is the first animated product ever created by this production company. This not only lead to a lot of online controversy (since Laura Gallego was very open about her disappointment), but it also lowered the general quality of this show. My conclusion: You will only enjoy this show if you completely ignore the books, and you´re a BIG fantasy fan, but don´t think this represents the original story. There are a bunch of unique moments in the books that were slightly changed in this series, turning them into grey and generic (like the opening scene: I always thought the start of the first novel was pretty original, but in this series it was changed to the most generic main-character introduction ever). But to each his/her own."
Damnation,I wonder who thought this might be a success...,"If you don't like animation, this show is not for you. If you don't like storys written for children, this show is not for you. If you don't like shows getting somewhat bloody, this show is not for you. If you don't like fantasy, this show is not for you. And if you like all of the above? Then it's... okay. This show feels like it's made for children but somehow the creators thought the fights should be realistically brutal -- and didn't consider the consequences for the age limit (16 here in Germany). There are storys that look like they are for children, but aren't in a awesome way (e.g. Made in Abyss) but this is non of that. However, it has one thing going for it: It's fantasy. Not that it is particularly great, but if you really need a fantasy series and have no other left, you might give this one a try."
Damnation,Like a bad teenage show with its good parts,"Its like a child story with adult elements (blood, sex, to much badly written conflicting feelings). But it has its interesting different elements, even if there somewhat badly written. Could have been great but lacks in good dialogues and incoherrent story. So far im half way trough season 2 episode 4, almost stoped watching it many times"
Damnation,Don't waste out time with a part two,"Mediocre animation, bad voice acting by the main character, plot holes... and an ending that doesn't really wrap anything up. I'm not sure if the source material is better, but if it is, then the author must be fuming."

Damnation,"I like the theme, but it was a very boring animation to watch","I enjoy fantasy stories, the concept is good but this series makes a common mistake on this genre of story, which is trying to create everything, all the details, too much epic and on the result you get a confusing plot that is boring and doesn't fill the holes. The art backgrounds were good designed and painted, but when it comes to the animation itself, a lot of scenes are very bad linked, the animation isn't much smooth and character's acting was very weak and lack of any charisma to make them likable / interesting , still far from any good anime made by Japanese's company. The story is very slow pace and filled with boring cliche teenage drama and almost no action. If you are looking for a good epic fantasy animation, I would recommend a title like Trollhunters instead of this one."
Damnation,Childish script,Interesting story but poorly executed. Script is horrible and plot is rediculous.
Damnation,Wished it had more episodes,"I really like this show, but five episodes come on Netflix really!? It was just starting to get good, and bam it is over smh"
Damnation,Trash,"Story is garbage, this was made by a person who had the brain of a teenage girl. The boy jake does not show real emotion if a girl that i liked had the audacity to kiss my parents murder i would kill them both and she is really ignorant this was something i was trying to watch cause i was bored but it got me pissed off and i didnt even want to watch it but i did so i could that trash off my continue watching"
Damnation,Boring bad story,I watched it all and all it was was an annoying slow moving horrific drama with little plot and no point. There was almost no action and the so called heros even after five episodes where just preteen crybabies and other then hold a so called heroic weapon did nothing of any importance. Just trash

Damnation,It was pretty okay,"So the thing is it's a good show, beautiful scenery and I love the animations, but it felt very rushed and unfinished. Only having 5 episodes really played into that. I wish we saw more development in the characters. I finished the show quickly and it felt very kiddish. Now I don't mind kid shows in fact I love plenty of them but being tv-14 and not having the more mature feeling I was hoping for was disappointing. This show had a lot of potential but it was wasted. Don't get me wrong it's not horrible but 5 episodes??? Anyways to wrap this up I don't recommend this show. I hate to say it but it was a waste of time.

Damnation,"The Most Childish, Whiny, Annoying, anime EVER!","Good grief this show was pathetic and predictable. I've never hated a main character so much as the ""whiny Jack"" who is undoubtedly one of the dumbest idiots to ever be chosen as the hero of the show. If you like whiny, annoying, entitled, petulant babies who lack all reason and small shred of common sense, this show is perfect for you. I've watched many anime series and had to turn this off due to the sheer ridiculousness of how much I truly despised how weakly developed the characters were. Especially the main character who takes it to a whole new level and made it impossible to root for him when he constantly complains like an unthankful spoiled brat. What a complete waste and your time is better spent watching paint dry. What a complete dumpster fire and hope ""whiny Jack"" gets the beating he truly deserves. This is the first time I actually rooted for the bad guys to prevail. This anime is a dreadful streak mark in the pants of decent anime."

Jen Kirkman: I'm Gonna Die Alone (And I Feel Fine),Thoughtful topics,"It's good to see a woman doing stand up and not going for her body parts and her relationships and ""that period of the month"" - ha ha. I mean, Jen Kirkman does that, but she does it with a purpose beyond cheap entertainment extracted from the simple contrast. She is actually doing a critique of the society and of the stereotypes. In a way she has to be a stereotype to make fun of it. Yet somehow she is missing something. Maybe it is just the habit of having men - Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, etc - doing the critique. Or maybe Jen is missing something to make her act as good as theirs. Still, she is worth the time invested.

Bordertown,Let the story unfold,"A juggernaut of unfolding story lines, relationships and cinematography. Excellent script with a series of independent stories that the main characters develop their ongoing stories and provide their back stories with every subsequent episode. This series is appropriately rated MA with full female and male nudity so if that offends you look elsewhere. If reading subtitles are a issue then this isn't the series for you either.

But if you enjoy a suspense building drama crime series with excellent cinematography and excellent use of music to build tension and horror then don't pass this series up. 9 out of 10 for me."
Bordertown,Bordertown,"Kari Sorjonen is one of Finland's best detectives and had been working in Helsinki but now he transfers to Lappeenranta, a town on the border with Russia. Here he lives with his wife, who is recovering from cancer, and his teenage daughter. He is part of a special unit investigating serious crime. Inevitably most of these involve murder.

Each case typically lasts two episodes, a couple last three, there are also plot lines that run throughout the series. These ongoing plot lines involve the possibility of corruption in the town's administration as well as family issues for Kari. Kari has something of Sherlock Holmes about the way he solves cases so it isn't surprising there is also a 'Moriarty'; a killer who appears in several stories.

I really enjoyed this Finnish series. Each story provides a good mystery and the main characters are a lot of fun to watch. Ville Virtanen does a great job as Sorjonen; I loved how he constantly moves his hands as he thinks through problems. He contrasts impressively with Anu Sinisalo, who does a fine job as his tough-as-nails, ex-FSB partner Lena. The rest of the cast impress as well. It might be argued that family members of the two protagonists get caught up in the crimes a little too often but it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the series. The series has a great look, especially in episodes where the already impressive landscapes are blanketed in winter snow. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre looking for a new location and interesting characters.

These comments are based on watching the series in Finnish with English subtitles."
Bordertown,"Amazing cinematography, great characters and good story!","I just finished the first case (first 3 episodes) and I just had to write a review for this show! Its amazing and I'm so happy Netflix decided to buy it. I live in The Netherlands so foreign TV shows rarely air here. It's mostly the Swedish crime dramas that air. It's refreshing to see Finland join in on the fun.

This show looks and sounds amazing, great music as well! The characters are great and the acting is on point. A very professional presentation here that makes American shows look like a kids game. If you haven't given this show a thought or a try, please do! I'm completely hooked and pray they make a season 2!"
Bordertown,"Season 1 - Excellent, Season 2 - Annoying Plot Lines","Watching Season 1 of this Finnish detective series was a wonderful breath of fresh air. Intelligent and progressive characters, story lines, cinematography and script; what a pleasure.

Season 2 however is quite disappointing, the teenage daughters of two of the main detectives are involved in far too many hectic violent cases, even though they had had already been involved in traumatic violent cases in the first series. This is far too unrealistic, unlikely and unnecessary. In addition, although the two detectives move heaven and earth to save their children, the teenage daughters demonstrate no gratitude or love, only anger, and become extremely frustrating to watch. Is this a crime/police series or a teen drama. I can only wonder what happened to the intelligent and thoughtful story lines of the previous series."
Bordertown,[9.3] Deep-thinking Finnish series,"Sorjonen (Bordertown) is an original and interesting Finnish Crime Drama series where accentuation is put more on the viewers' thinking and deductive skills than developing depictions of Police Procedural Crime Action Thrillers.

(+) It has a strong penchant towards showing the main detective inspector's interactions with his family and vice-versa
(+) It relies deep on events' psychological factors and how Kari Sorjonen manages to see the truth and solve the case step by step using his awesome memory
(+) It has interesting, though a bit rushed, 2-3 episodes cases
(+) It has a nice opening sequence complemented with beautiful cinematography and Finnish sceneries, shown in right moments


A refreshing Finnish series where intuitions and psychological factors play a stronger role than bloody action thrilling dramas. Looking forward to its seasons 2 and 3.

It's really Finnish Sherlock in action with a soft side. _______________________________________ Had the pleasure to watch seasons 2 and 3_

They are both very good and share the same high standard as season 1; IMO though, season 3 is brighter and I really felt the need for it to have more than 10 episodes._ The relationship between father, mother and daughter is very well shown, played beautifully and ultra believably by the actors, making viewers believe that they are in fact a family._ Olivia Ainali is a very talented actress, beautiful and full of emotions, naturally shown on the screen. Would love to see her in US series. She really deserves to be recognized internationally.

The third season ended on some notes of sadness, but, nevertheless I truly hope that the series would continue on its bright path and bring us more exciting episodes on a possible season 4 and more..."
Bordertown,TO CHANGE TO ORIGINAL AUDIO,"I started watching season two and was IMMEDIATELY disappointed in your horribly dubbed English audio. Luckily I came to the reviews. You can go to your options to change the audio to the Finnish (original) language! Keep the subtitles in whatever language you need. Do yourself a favor and don't watch the series the ""Netflix"" way. It loses the quality. You need the original actor's voices. Something gets lost without their tone. This is such a great show. Now I haven't watched the second season yet, but I loved the first"
Bordertown,Would b 8+ but main detectives own kids are overly involved (Cheezy),"What's working? The cast Kari, Lena, the supporting officers and story lines are great especially in the earlier episodes of season 1. This show has the capacity to really really go deep if it adjusts its trajectory. Kari is an incredibly unique character and Lena is equally incredible and intriguing yet different and the complementing case/family members are great. The one psychotic bad guy on season 1 was awesome too.

What's not working? They are overly involving the 2 main detectives kids too many times as victims in the plot lines... This just isn't realistic. I mean both kids have been separately involved twice in life threatening plot lines in the first season alone spanning half the 1st season episodes. If 50% of the season 1 crimes their trying to solve involve both lead detectives kids it just doesn't hold up... This is supposed to be a serious investigative crime drama. I have a hard time believing someone on the writing team didn't feel this as incredibly cheezy.

I really love the show and think it has serious potential but they need to keep it more realistic... and less forcing the teen angle into the story lines where it just doesn't fit."
Bordertown,Top marks to the Finns for this show; more please!,"Firstly, I don't write reviews unless I've watched the whole show or series. I watch a lot of foreign content and loved this series. Whilst I agree with one reviewer who criticised the show for wrapping up episodes a little too quickly, thus making the conclusion a tad hard to understand, this really affected only 1 or 2 episodes. Overall, the stories are well thought out, the acting is good and the scenery superb.

I liked the way the characters were developed and found myself invested in their personalities and lives. It's not just a cop show - you experience both the professional and private relationships of Kari, his family members and his work alliances. And whilst the stories do stand alone, it's best to watch the series in sequence to fully appreciate and understand the interrelationships that develop.

I believe a lot of thought went into the casting of the series. Ville Virtanen as the lead character Kari Sorjonen is superb - as well as being a nice bit of eye candy for we ladies. Matleena Kuusniemi, who plays Kari's wife Paulina, is just delightful and I cannot imagine anyone better for that role. Olivia Ainali, who plays their daughter Janina, looks like she could be their offspring and plays her role as a young adolescent, coping with all the complexities of that age group and peer pressures, very convincingly.

I'm hoping for a second series. Nine out of ten from me."

Bordertown,Too much personal/family drama,Love this show but season 2 and even more so season 3 are bogged down with his sick wife and loopy daughter storylines. Throughout season 3 I would literally groan when the daughter appeared on screen. Frankly I could not care less about the detective's family life and wish they would've devoted more attention to the police team and their cases.
Bordertown,Sorjonen - A Finnish Taste of Noir,"Taking his leave from hectic Helsinki to find more peace of mind and time for his family, Finnish detective Sorjonen finds himself and his loved ones more and more intertwined with the intrigues of Lappeenranta, a small town near the border with Russia.

The show is subdivided into several 'cases' covering three or four episodes each, giving you a quick and steady build-up of suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat and hungry for answers. The characters develop naturally, and their interactions are natural and witty. Cinematography-wise, the film makers went out their way to contrast the beauty of the Finnish landscape with the dull greyness of a small industrial town.

Sorjonen/Bordertown's reserved characters may be a typical and accurate representation of the overall Finnish disposition, but it's the rough edges, quirky little details and the snarky responses from the somewhat stubborn Sorjonen that give this show a very authentic feel. Sorjonen having to move an inevitable pile of paper clutter from Taina's passenger seat before he can sit down, for instance, is a very natural thing to happen, and would surely be polished out in Hollywood shows. Another refreshing example is Lena, a stocky blonde in her late 40s. As the actual unscrupulous ex-FSB Russian muscle of the show, she won't shy away from a few unconventional methods to get answers. At the same time, she is having a hard time being a mother to troubled Katia.

If you're looking for points of critique, it would be that some of the characters are surprisingly quick in recovering from rather traumatic experiences, and there's a few loose ends that remain unanswered. Also, there's quite a worrying number of really twisted people in the small town of Lappeenranta.

If you are looking for rapid action and wild shoot-outs, this isn't the show for you. If you're into natural acting and subtle, dark humour, then this is highly recommended."
Bordertown,Watchable...But Uneven And Unrealistic,"I enjoyed ""Sorjonen,"" but then again, I'm a sucker for Scandi/Nordic Noir, so sue me. This series lacks the bluish-greyish moody tinge of many other noirs, opting instead for full technicolor hues; nevertheless, it had its heart in the right place. ""Bordertown"" is so well-filmed that the series felt almost like a Rick Steves travelogue - you can practically smell the scents of their local dishes like.ruisleipä (rye bread) or.lihapullat (Finnish meatballs). As detective fiction goes, ""Sorjonen"" most hit the mark. Mostly. My two peeves? 1. Kari Sorjonen's character. It's obvious that he's autistic. As a child and adult, his organizational traits are strong. Even as a bullied child, his psychologist noted he'd be unable to connect to people. Yet, there he is, an emotional feeling adult complete with a wife and kid. That part is non believable. Autistic people don't grow out of their traits, at least not to the point where they're living a wholesome family life. There's a reason why the suicide rate is extremely high with this population, and i should know. I'm one of them. 2. I get that, as a series, they opt to have happy endings always, maybe as a way to lure American viewers. What happened, though, is that many endings had forced positive outcomes that were rushed (crammed) into the last five minutes or so. That was an annoying and unrealistic concept, but I suppose from a monetary point of view, necessary. Overlooking these two missteps, ""Bordertown"" is still valuable entertainment."
Bordertown,Annoying Scandinavian Noir,"The premise is that Sorjonen is this genius detective with Asperger's Syndrome, although that diagnosis is never actually given. I watched all 3 seasons, and I enjoyed the first season, but by the time I'd watched 2 or 3 episodes of the second season, I was thoroughly sick of Ville Virtanen attempting to play the genius detective, and by the time I'd finished Season 3 I was so sick of his bratty, out of control daughter, Janina, that I was ready for the series to be over. As Sorjonen, Ville Virtanen does a lot of geeky, awkward moves with his hands when he's ""thinking"" (e.g., waves his hands above his head, from the back to the front, without actually touching his head 'to shut out negative thoughts'). Watching him make these moves, I remembered when I got my first computer and thought it would be cool to attach different sounds to different actions, only to realize within a few minutes that what had seemed like a good idea in theory was just incredibly annoying in practice. My guess is a writer or director thought these moves would enhance the character's weirdness, but they just become super annoying mannerisms in very short order. But the annoying mannerisms are just the tip of the iceberg. In one of the early episodes in the second season, Sorjonen is interviewing a female witness and they're seated on opposite sides of a table in an interview room (of course) and mid interview, he puts one of his feet on the table and proceeds to not only remove his boot and sock, but then begins cutting his toenails, with bits of nail flying everywhere, and everyone pretends that's normal and perfectly OK because he's supposed to be such an effing genius. All I could think was, what's next? Will he take a dump on the table while interviewing a witness? The character is a narcissistic pig who expects everyone to put up with his crap, but I didn't find him attractive enough to pull off being so obnoxious. I liked Olivia Ainali as Janina in Seasons 1 and 2, but in Season 3, she turns into a narcissitic sociopath who goes from bludgeoning an injured dog to death to bullying the boy, Jarkko (Johannes Brotherus) who expresses an interest in her to the point that I wondered if the storyline would have him suicidal. That didn't happen, but if any viewer thinks for a minute that what Janina does in Season 3 to Jarkko is OK, imagine if she was a male doing the same thing to a female, and you'll see how not OK her actions are. Also, I don't know if this is poor direction or poor acting or a combination of both, but whenever anyone talks to her, she juts out her lower jaw and sits there with her mouth hanging open and a ""Duh"" expression on her big moon face, and that just doesn't work. Janina regresses as a character, in contrast to Katia Jaakkola, portrayed by Lenita Susi, whose character really grows. By the end of Season 3, I was so tired of the Sorjonens that I was happy for the season to end."
Bordertown,Apparently the first true Nordic Noir coming from Finland,"About a decade has passed when Forbrydelsen, Millennium-stories and others have spread throughout the world with their wittiness and approach. Until now, all other Nordic countries, even small Iceland, have had their own successful series - except Finland. But with Sorjonen/Bordertown, this shortcoming was rectified. And so vigorously!

Indeed, Sorjonen is no sneaking in, it is a versatile and well created story, with interesting characters and powerful performances (particularly Ville Virtanen as Detective Inspector Kari Sorjonen; somehow I have missed to follow this character actor before), where all members of the cast have their important contribution, there are hardly no excessive characters or events; even some story lines and scenes you might think lead to clichés, they have not (until now), but something has to be expected or understandable, otherwise all the plot would plunge into tedious mysticism and supernatural conclusion of cases. True, there is one case per 2(3) episodes, but there are strong links among them and new stuff from the past is explained, thus it is advisable to watch all them in succession.

Well done, guys! And beautiful Finnish nature provides additional value the whole concept. Looking forward to Season 2 already.

PS Season 2 is meaty as well, although Sorjonen himself is a bit less main character there. I hope they create more seasons.

PS Season 3 is even more psychological, emanating from a certain sad family event... The cases are more discursive, but still - it is a good series."
Bordertown,Another Adult Show Ruined by Teenage Drama,The annoying petulant teenage offspring of the two lead detectives are insinuated into almost every plot undermining the entire series.This show would have been much more interesting had the focus been kept on the Special Crimes Task Force. The two lead detectives are characters that could have stood on their own without being dragged down with all the family drama. The acting was top notch except for the teens who were out of their league.

Bordertown,Good first season,"Loved the first season, interesting main character and the murder cases/investigations were clever. However, the second and third season lost the plot and spent too much time on weird subplots and an overrated villain."
Bordertown,change the language,Another review noted that Netflix has dubbed season two. Change the language back to finnish with english subtitles. Much better. Very good show.
Bordertown,Good but need the fast forward button for the teenagers!,"Excellent Finnish nordic noir with surprisingly dark plots, interesting main characters and some unexpected twists though occasonally seems to wrap up episodes to suit the run time rather than the storyline. Sadly marred by the two lead detectives' teenage children and their subplots. Initially thought I was being miserable until I read all the other reviewers here also admitting to fast-forwarding their scenes. Completely unlikeable uncharismatic characters with bizarrely unrealistic connections to almost every plot. Made even worse by the teenage sex scenes; no prude and have no issues with what teenagers get up to but also no wish to find myself watching them. Hard to guess the typical demographics of nordic noir fans but I doubt these child characters were pulling in more viewers - were they related to the director or writers?"
Bordertown,Change the audio to Finnish (Original),"It's a compelling crime drama that I found quickly addictive. The character development is well done, and there's a nice mix of suspense and twists. My only critique is the dubbing is awful. Luckily I saw the advice of another reviewer to change the audio to FInnish and turn on English subtitles. This allows you hear the proper tone of the actors."
Bordertown,Worthy watching,"The 1st episode seems too much, a bit exaggerated the whole mnemonic thing, but from the 2nd episode on the plot finds its way and it's really worthy watching."
Bordertown,Great acting and story lines,"The stories and build up of this series is amazing. The way the characters match and are not overdone (like us series) is really good.

Ville put down an excellent role where you follow his pattern of evolving, not only work wise but also as the family man that he is.

I really recommend people to watch this great series, i've watched in one breathe.

Waiting for season 2 ;-)"
Bordertown,overplayed characters,"Good series altogether, I have just watched season 2 and I feel that the show is relying too much on the special mental abilities of Kari. As for his daughter Janina, she is simply dreadful as a spoiled brat who has endless claims to her rights without much less to make her friendly."
Bordertown,Season 3 very disappointing,"My wife and I enjoyed the first two seasons of Boardertown, however we could not even get through the first episode of Season 3. The story gets dragged down by the very slow scenes of the main characters wife's cancer sickness in the hospital. Instead of the story focusing on the kidnapping of women and girls it drags very slowly with scenes in the hospital with the main character, his sick wife and his daughter. We gave up about half way through season 3 episode one and deleted the show from our watchlist. Too bad they screwed up a good show."

Pocoyo,To Be A Child Again...,"Great cartoon for preschoolers. If I were three years old, this is what I would want to watch all the time. It's fun, educational, and the narrating voice for the English version is lent by Stephen Fry. It doesn't get any better than this! Two series have been made, each consisting of 52 episodes. An additional season, called ""Let's Go Pocoyo!"", was created to teach English to Spanish kids. Three more seasons were released between 2016 and 2018. Each episode is 7 minutes long. I like ""Pocoyo"" for its original format: made entirely using 3D technology, the background is white, and the narrator interacts with Pocoyo and the viewers. Each story teaches a word or value. The sound effects are very funny and the stories are smart and fresh.

Pocoyo's channel on YouTube is very popular. It offers a wide variety of videos in no less than 13 languages. A fun way for your kid to learn new languages!"
Pocoyo,Pocoyo is much better than Caillou and Peppa Pig.,"In this TV series, you can see Pocoyo and his friends in their incredible adventures in the episodes. It has many iconic and likable characters. Pocoyo, the title character, is well-mannered, cheerful and kind. He, being a small child, tends to be childish. He speaks a lot of words despite being only four years old.

He is very affectionate with others. He is not as nice as he was in season four, but he is still likable, remembering that he sometimes has his moments of quarrel with his friends, but regularly regrets his actions. He can also take things out on the wrong people. Pato, who is a sometimes grumpy, but often calm duck who plays with his friends, and enjoys watering flowers. I would say that Pocoyo has a good friend. Elly, who also likes to play with others and play and tea with her doll. I wouldn't say it's the best children's show, but use this to educate your children or children that you are responsible. Please don't use Peppa Pig or Caillou, use Pocoyo or Hello Kitty."
Pocoyo,SOOOO Cute!!!!!,"Here are the comedy adventures of a mischievous but well meaning little boy, Pocoyo, and his friends Ellie, a pink elephant (who is very kind hearted and unselfish), and a mad duck, Pato, with obsessive compulsive tendencies, my favourite character. Other characters include Sleepy Bird, a puppy and a whale.

Although this show is meant for pre-schoolers, it is rapidly becoming a favourite show for my daughter and I. The characters are incredibly cute and the stories emphasise the importance of kindness and consideration, as well as being entertaining. The narration provided by Stephen Fry is masterfully warm and appealing, without feeling patronising as so many shows for younger children tend to be.

There are points in the show where Mr Fry addresses the viewer with a question, and an unseen group of children reply, filling in that awkward silence that can occur. Mr Fry's perfect diction is a big plus as well, particularly when considering the importance of this to a pre-school audience.

For far too long, Children's programming has suffered dreadfully from politically correct and patronising attitudes of programme makers who want to appeal to children, but do not actually understand what they need... Simplicity, clarity,and good stories. Too much Children's TV is over busy, over coloured, sloppily presented by people who can barely speak themselves, and appearing to be aimed at immature students rather than children in terms of content.

Pocoyo is an unexpected gem amidst the sea of dross.. slightly reminiscent of the original ""Magic Roundabout"" in feel. This show is appealing to all ages"

Pocoyo,Wonderful show!,"This is by far one of the most wonderful cartoon shows on TV! It is packed with fun, interesting information, cuteness, vivid and friendly colors, information, friendship stories, simplicity elevated to extraordinary, all in all ... an Original. I love the narrator, Stephen Fry! He is the beating heart of the stories. He coordinates so well the action with the words! Great narrator choice! He is so much fun, as much as Pocoyo, Pato, Ellie, the Bird, and the cute dog. And the Octopus who can make everyone laugh! My 2-year old laughs along with Pocoyo. Hurray for Pocoyo and his creators! Thank you for a wonderful show, Gentlemen! Keep your brilliancy lighting our life!"
Pocoyo,My favorite kids show,I'm pretty selective with what my toddler watches. I love this show. The lessons are fantastic. The animation is adorable. My 2 year old is engaged and learning. And it's just simple fun!
Pocoyo,Quirky Fun For Children and Their Parents!,"Pocoyo is my 20-month old son's absolute favorite thing to watch. His Grandma kind of got him hooked on it while I was at work all day so I started watching it to see what he was experiencing. At first it kind of annoyed me with its very bold colors on a white background, but then I saw the Dance Off episode which is hilarious and gives nods to pop and rock music, and decided I loved it too. The British narrator is very good and the quirky personalities of each character keep us interested. Pato is a bit neurotic, Elly is a primadonna , the octopus Fred is a crack-up with his gibberish, there's a silly little caterpillar that makes funny faces, and Pocoyo himself behaves much like any toddler with ups and downs, a bit of mischief and an innocent soul. There's an episode called Angry Alien which frightens my son so I have to watch it when he goes to bed but it's hilarious with this little green alien who has this evil laugh and he tries to take over Pocoyo's world but he's really small so no one takes him seriously and he gets so mad! It's pretty funny. Now the husband and I watch the show and we love it as much as our son does."
Pocoyo,were programmes this fantastic when we were kids?,"quite simply, this show has to be seen to be truly appreciated for the simplistic masterpiece it is, defying all the expectations of a traditionally formulaic and mind-numbingly boring true 'kid's TV programme'...

the programme itself almost mocks the complexity of its rivals, with a totally white background and characters so basic and almost clichéd that on the surface 'Pocoyo' could be very easily underestimated.

Pocoyo - sky blue outfit, cutest little kid since Boo from 'Monsters Inc.', almost like one of the audience has stepped into the wonderful world in that 10 minute slot. Patto - the greatest dead-pan animated character since Gromit, who can independently spin his beak around his head like a fun Daffy Duck, extend his neck and becomes grumpy when he loses his green hat. Elly - a pink elephant, who can type on a laptop and ride a scooter... need i say more except... legend! Lula - imagine a dog in computer animation... exactly that. Sleepy-Bird - sleeps... is comically woken up... frowns... goes back to step 1

if there is more convincing to be done, Stephen Fry plays the omniscient narrator who seems to be taught as much by Pocoyo as he teaches all the characters... which is always entertainment, even if it goes over the true-watcher's (kid's) heads... proving how accessible this masterpiece is to all ages wishing to explore their own anti-Spielberg ""child-within"". the stories themselves condemn conventional story lines, introducing new characters without trying to be anything except a kid's TV programme, such as aliens and even one where the characters race across their bare landscape.

beautifully made, funny, for all ages, simple, entertaining, not too adventurous, fantastic, imaginative, original

...i never want it to end after 10 minutes... my desire for this programme will never be saturated even if i buy the DVD

wonderful"
Pocoyo,Pocoyo for the win!,"As a parent of a severely developmentally delayed autistic child, I am ecstatic for this show. My son was never interested in anything in general, toys, tv, music, nothing. One day I stumbled across pocoyo on Netflix and he actually watched! I noticed all other shows were overstimulating for all the excessive colors and background 'noise'. But after watching pocoyo I went on to discover more simplisticly colored shows similar in style, held his attention! Since then he reacts more and actively tries to play with me and his older brother. Thank you to whomever created this show and others like it. Now we have pocoyo books and other toys and we are actually able to connect with him."
Pocoyo,One of my son's favourites!,"I love Pocoyo, it's wholesome, fun, friendly and has very few incidents of rude behaviour for my child to replicate. Hard to find on television if you ask me! As the show moves season to season, it seems to grow with your child. By season 3 they're going over vocabulary, quantities, etc and singing songs. My son loves to sing along and I can see him learning and retaining information. Couldn't ask for better from a children's show. The negative reviews here didnt seem to consider how TV shows look to young kids. Children have much more open minds and are learning, it is not a negative to have the show on a white background, or for Pocoyo to not know many things."
Pocoyo,Brilliant show,"My toddler interacts amazingly with every bit of the show and learns new things with every episode. Also, we love Stephen Fry'a accent and narration."
Pocoyo,"Pocoyo is fun, colorful and entertaining to kids, would absolutely recommend",Comentario no disponible
Pocoyo,Pocoyo is BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!,"I saw Pocoyo the other day on CITV and it was BRILLIANT! The one I saw was the one with ""Super Pocoyo"", who refused to answer to Steven Fry when he said, ""Hello Pocoyo"", to which Pocoyo replied, ""Mm"". I think that this is the only good cartoon kiddy show to be shown on ITV since the glory days of Tots TV (which was CLASS). Overall, I think Pocoyo should be upgraded to a primetime slot on ITV1 in place of Ant and Dec as the host of Saturday Night Takeaway. Well done on a blistering career Pocoyo, and long may your reign of disturbing blueness continue. I also like your weird mates, including the bird who can twist his beak 360 degrees."
Pocoyo,"Absolutely Fan, Flipintastic!!!!",Comentario no disponible
Pocoyo,Even Teens think he owns!,"When I first saw Pocoyo I said ""Isn't that the kid from Digimon?"" as the startup went on we saw a duck that looks and acts like Coach Z from the ever popular Homestarrunner.com website, a pink elephant (Witch is always cool) and a dog I though Pocoyo called ""Bo-ya!"" So naturally I was intrigued. Now i've seen 1/5 of the season me and my 18 year old brother are hooked! It has great appeal to everyone. My personal favourite is the episode with the Martians.

Pocoyo is a small boy who looks a bit like TK from Digimon series 2. But way cooler! He speaks in short sentences but what he says is really cool and the way he says it!

Elly is the pink elephant, sometimes she's cool, others she can be a real drag. So there's mixed feelings about her but the idea rules.

Patto is the Coach Z and he fits the awesomeness of Coach Z! Homestar runner fans will absolutely Love this duck! He can extend his neck, spin his beak and look totally awesome. him and Pocoyo go together like Apple and Pie! I want a Patto action figure!

We don't really see much of Loula (Bo-Ya) or Sleepy bird (Did i miss her?) but there are loads of side characters you can enjoy to, like the aliens and whale. PLUS Pocoyo has his own Ballon powered helicopter! How awesome is that? Believe me, watch it and you'll love it best kids TV program ever, Sorry Thoamas The Tank Engine!"
Pocoyo,Cool,"I think this programme is very good for young children, as pocoyo is a small boy who befriends an elephant, a duck, a bird who is always asleep and has a loving puppy called loula. Stephen fry does an excellent job- and doesn't speak too quickly for younger children. Pocoyo translates from Spanish into ""little me"". And that's exactly what he is. He's a small boy in his own world, with his friends along side him and a kind narrator to guide him. I watch it every day and it is not too long, but makes you happy. :) Children of all ages can enjoy it and he really is sweet. Elly the elephant is large and pink and is always there for little pocoyo. She likes having baths and always has a blue backpack with her. Pato the duck is rather quick to anger, but is an equally good friend, and always wishes good things, and is always up for a dance. Loula the dog is an actual pet dog of pocoyo's and therefore barks and howls if he sees something or his happy/upset. Sleepy bird: what can i say? the name says it all. This is a very sleepy bird, who always seems to get woken up somehow, but pocoyo usually calms her down. Recently, in newer episodes, Sleepy bird had a little baby, who doesn't seem to be as keen on sleeping."

The Barrier,Abuelita's Sci-fi TV Novela,"I watched this because I really enjoyed Ministerio Del Tiempo. Unlike Ministerio, The Barrier, often indulges in TV Novela-like melodramatic overacting. I figure one's ability to tolerate this depends on how many hours of TV Novelas one's abuelita subjected him or her to. If you can muscle or fast forward through the overacted parts it's a good show."
The Barrier,Worthy,"Another ""coincidentally"" eerie pandemic show. Here it's 2045 and society has fallen because of a lingering deadly virus. Martial law is in effect but of course those mostly inconvenienced are the poor. The wealthy make the laws and live as they please. Nobody can be trusted. The usual stuff. Shades of Colony and The Handmaid's Tale. Right down to the little kid the acting is very good."
The Barrier,Good show,So far an engaging series. Why anyone would ever want to watch anything that's been dubbed is beyond me. If you are literate enough to write a review then subtitles should not be a problem. Dubbed is always worse. Thank god Netflix allows you to choose.

The Barrier,Spanish documentary,"A virus is released into the world, the poor and innocent suffer, the sick are left to die without treatment, authoritarian governments are installed, the classes are segregated, everyone except the so-called elite has their freedoms removed, any protesting is violently suppressed, drones are used, curfews enforced, false propaganda is forced on the people, fear keeps the people under control, travel passes are required to go anywhere, neighbours spy on each other for the government, children are experimented on with vaccines, food shortages, a global depopulation agenda ...

Based on a true story."
The Barrier,"chilling, given where we are in in late 2020","Anyone living in 2020 should not have much trouble envisioning just how humanity got to this post apocalyptic future, complete with virus and totalitarian woke-tocarcy."
The Barrier,Enjoyable but their emotional immaturity was tiring,"By episode 3 the contrived plot devices were tiring.

To maintain a semblence of believability in the narrative their impulsive outbursts would have seen them fired 20 times and probably shot 5 times"
The Barrier,I was hooked right at the start,"I watch this in Spanish and leave the subtitles in Spanish- great to watch the movie in its native language. The music, the acting, and the cinematography is excellent. I watched the first three episodes in a row and cannot wait for the next one!"
The Barrier,Really like this,"To the near future, a virus strikes upon the world and a regime takes control A husband loses his wife and separated from his daughter The struggle is about to escalate"
The Barrier,I wanted to like this series.,"I really want to like this series, the plot is interesting, and quite original. But the cast is just frustrating, or more likely the directions they are given. Constantly over acting on the side of melodrama in almost ridiculous ways. Any normal person would keep a low profile in dangerous situations, but here they throw fits, scream and yell for no good reason, seemingly totally unaware of how much attention they are attracting. It's like these guys have survived hard conditions, but somehow managed to gather exactly zero street smartness. In a society with a strong class system, you can't just ignore your superiors, or challenge them any time you disagree with them, Not that I think it is the right thing to do on a general level, but being constantly melodramatic, is probably not gonna get you far when you live in a police state. Had this been real I doubt many of them would have survived up to the point where the story takes place. What a shame."
The Barrier,I hope for a second season,I loved this show!! I hope they make a second season!!
The Barrier,A pleasant surprise for Netflix,Well done cinematography acting and overall performance enjoyable. I wish Netflix did more movies like this when they dubbed them in English.
The Barrier,Mostly infuriating characters,"I thought this would be a great show since the plot sounded interesting, but I could never get past the fact that the majority of the characters were so brash and annoying. The main male character especially. I can get past the fact that they are going through a difficult time but I wish they would stop making dramatic entrances and yelling every episode. The only character I cared for was Alma who carried the show imo. I wouldn't rewatch this, ever."
The Barrier,Bravo,I was happy to hear the actors speaking their native tongues. Even though I don't speak Spanish the emotions come across. Always happy to read subtitles
The Barrier,Slightly wooden acting and cliched story,"Three episodes in and I'm not sure if I'll carry on with this-the acting is a bit wooden, the story line is a bit cliche and the sets are quite low budget. The opening music is also like something out of kids TV... it's not the most important thing but it has you laughing at the beginning of each episode which I never found when watching the Handmaiden's Tale!"
The Barrier,Well-paced; somewhat cliched plot; entertaining enough,"It's not going to become a classic, but it's enjoyable enough. Ángela Molina and -especially- Eleonora Wexler steal the show. Such great actors!"
The Barrier,Spanish Holocaust after another world war,"This Spanish apocalyptic drama is excellent really, with great facial expressions and mannerisms not seen amongst American actors. The premise of the movie is a futuristic totalitarian government built on the backs of the poor and ethics groups to succeed. (Sound familiar?). Keep an open mind as the lines between black and white aren't readily drawn, and often one has to commit crime for the greater good. This is not Kantian philosophical forces at work here. There is a flexible dichotomy with lying and crime. One must do what is right and lay down ones life if necessary to uphold justice, freedom , morality and ethics. What else is new in world history gone wrong? Pax, Murf"
The Barrier,Heavy handed.....,"The Barrier overdoses on an oppressive authoritarianism.

I simply could not get into this series. Its so loaded down with misery and oppressiveness that, for me, it snuffed out any sense of hope.

If its reminiscent of anything, I would say its the superb film adaptation of Orwell book 1984. The contrast, of course, is 1984 is film length version and whilst still not an easy watch, is digestible.

Spread over the length of a series, its exhausting and I feel, a little overstated. Whats also inexplicable, is the often spectacularly stupid and/or reckless moves, made by the main characters. I get that they are desperate but desperation, in this environment, needs to be tempered by caution and reason. How they survive as long as they do, is beyond me.

Acting is excellent, top shelf, as are production values, sets, costumes, etc. Certainly there are bleak aspects, reminiscent of the Fascist Franco-ist period of Spanish history, on offer here.

I'm not rating this series down too far, partly because my response is a personal one. That said, I do stand by my belief that the treatment is somewhat heavy handed and the story lacks a certain credibility.

6/10."
The Barrier,Nice to Earth.,"Till so far I really like it. I'm watching episode 5 now. I've also watch the Handsmaid Tail, but till so far, I don't see a similarity, like I've read in an other review."
The Barrier,A missed chance.,Comentario no disponible
The Barrier,Pretty bad!,"Dystopian facist state for dummies. Reasonable plot but badly done. All the usual formulaic stuff overdone. Faceless, robotic soldiers. Fiendish baddie torturers. 2 dimensional characters. Exaggerated fearsome/tragic eyebrows. The director must have a very low opinion of their audience. I left after 3 episodes."
The Barrier,So realistic it's almost like prophecy,"The story is so original that it's like nothing else. Initially I found the story unrealistic. I mean, almost a year ago?I was wrong. Now it's so realistic that it's just like a mirror image of our reality. How could a writer make this plot before the China virus pandemic!!!! He or she must be a genius.

I stopped watching it several times but now I feel shamefully stupid. It totally worths to have a second watch. The English dub is excellent, and I would expect more when I watch it again in the original Spanish language.

Pandemic could turn a free society into a quasi-police state? Yes. So sad but so true. The director has successfully made me immersed in that theory. In addition, the actors have played their roles pretty well. The combination? A wonderful surprise. To me, it's the best Spanish series on Netflix so far.

I would recommend my friends to watch it, definitely."
The Barrier,Better than thought it might be..,"I know this show has many mixed reviews.. some say the actors over acted or made things more dramatic than needed. I do see that sometimes with foreign films and it drives me crazy. I feel it's usually done when the movie was made in another language and they basically did a voice over with English. I'm guessing those who watched it in original Spanish mode/language maybe thought about it differently than those of us who don't speak Spanish.. (wish I did).

So... I see where some were turned off because it seemed some actors were over dramatic. I usually want to give a show a fair chance to impress me and unless it's absolutely horrible.. will commit to watching 2 episodes. After that I decide if I really want to continue.

With this show... the first Episode wasn't my favorite because of what I stated just above (over acting or drama) however I liked where I thought the writer/director etc.. were going with the story. So I watched the 2nd episode and was happy I did. I wish Netflix would have picked it up for another season.

I also wish the USA would teach kids multiple languages starting in pre school or kindergarten. Like other countries. It's usually easier to learn when younger. I would have loved to know Spanish, French, Japanese and maybe Mandarin."
The Barrier,Spanish Handmaids tale,"Its very obvious the writters have watched the handmaids tale or read the book. the music , the way was filmed and story is like 90% Sadly the acting is terrible, overacting like a mexican telenovela sometimes. the idea is good but it was not well executed. If you liked little bit this show and you have not watched the handmaids tale , please do so."

Unriddle,Solid Singaporean series,"The idea of watching a television show from the small country of Singapore will probably have many potential viewers at first saying, ""Why would I want to watch such a show?"" To that I say, ""Why not?"" After all, there are some terrific television shows coming out from Asia, many of them available on Netflix, which is where I found ""Unriddle"". And it's a very well done police show. It is by no means perfect. While the show never looks downright cheap, the low budget is often evident. And there is some clunky writing here and there, ranging from hard to believe plot turns to supposed surprises being no surprise at all. But the show has more strengths than weaknesses. The two lead actresses do a very good job in their very different roles, and when paired together, generate some excellent chemistry. The show also emphasizes characters, giving them multiple layers and room to grow and evolve over the course of many episodes. And there are no dull spots, despite the fact that there isn't a terrible amount of action. As I said, this isn't a classic show, but it's quite likable and watchable. I just finished watching the first season a few minutes ago, and I am very much looking forward to watching the second season."

Unriddle,Another great series from the Far East...,"Producers from South Korea, and the Far East (Singapore, etc.) are churning out the best 16- and 20- chapter mini-series on the planet at present, and, if you dig on Netflix, you will find them. All themes are covered, particularly in the mystery and law-enforcement lines. Unriddle is another entry. We were delighted with the first season and are ready to tackle the second.

Unlike Hollywood, who aim to produce a sitcom or a crime series that will go multi seasons, in the Far East, they use the Brit approach, which is to create a show with unconventional twists for one season by scripting short movie type episodes (40 to 70 minutes). The story quality stays high, and the possibilities are endless, since one of the heroes of the story may not survive, giving the scriptwriter more freedom to develop a complex theme.

Unriddle (Unravel might have been a better name) tells the tale of a group of investigators with the Singapore police who are pursuing several lines of inquiry. Initially, a gang is smuggling in girls to serve in brothels, but one of the gang, an over-sized tomboy named Bun, breaks ranks to join with pretty Detective Hu Xiaoman as a paid informant. This smart cop and streetwise hustler make a good team. Plots overlap and intermingle, but the main plot involves a group of officers who recover a large sum of unaccounted-for money, and decide to split the profits. A falling-out occurs and the money disappears. Years later, one of the gang is a supervisor and potential love-interest for (major babe) Hu Xiaoman. He disappears, and one-by-one, the original gang bites the dust. Is it the supervisor, stepping out of character, to sneak back & take the gang out?

That is just one of the plot-lines pursued in Season one of the series. When reviewing other series of this kind, I caution readers to book lots of free time to binge-watch these things. Although this one had a few 'draggy' moments, generally the stories move along quite nicely. Performances and camera-work are great. I should have been able to 'sort' this whodunit, after reading so many Agatha Christie novels, but I must confess: this one bamboozled me completely, but in a delightful way."
Unriddle,Great Singaporean Police drama,"This Singaporean drama series was spellbinding. The series was well scripted and superbly cast. The storyline was thrilling and surprising to the very end of the second series. Strong women focus, family dynamics and current social themes added depth to a genre often devoid of relevance. In spite of the cinematography often reminiscent of low budget productions, a few cheesy lines and some wonky subplots, the strength of the leading actresses performance has me wishing that a season three or a possible movie is still a possibility for this police thriller."
Unriddle,Just missing a lot that I am use to in K-Dramas,"The quality of so much of this show is not up to what I normally find in the Korean dramas. This is almost 10 years old, and maybe comparable to the K-Dramas at the time. Everything seems a little stilted, and lacking a feeling of realism that I am use to. Hu Xiaoman use of Lin Zhengyi as effectively a partner just does not cut it, and being able to use Lin Zhengyi family (know it is not really a family but similar) just does not hold water. Sorry, K-Dramas to me are generally much better."

A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,It's an Auto Tune Christmas Miracle!!,"If you love hallmark Christmas movies (or if it's your guilty pleasure) you've come to the right place. But oh my lord, the auto tune!!!!! Abusive"
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Auto tune??,Okay so like it's your average cliche Cinderella story but I still liked it--except for the auto tune in every song oh my gosh. Like I'm sure she can actually sing I think? Why do they have so much auto tune?
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,To much...,"It is an ok movie, but why the autotune? It ruined for me."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Awful,"It supposed to be a musical film, but every song (I mean it), EVERY song has autotune that make your ears bleed. My advice - don't waste your time."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Good Christmas movie,Just another cinderella story but at least with a unique approach being she is trying to be a singer. Its worth watching and a 6/10 seems fair.

A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,A sassy holiday update on the timeless classic story,"Don't skip this on account of the low average. Some people hate it, true, but it's no worse than many of the Cinderella remakes of the past 20 years and it's definitely better than some.

In this version, the Cinderella character has the requisite evil stepmother & stepsisters, but she's also got a career plan that keeps her working toward her own goals. Also, she gives the 'handsome prince' a no-nonsense privilege-check when he asks her to do something that might cost her job. How often does a Cinderella character get to call out a rich boy without either agonizing over it or getting punished for it?

The musical numbers aren't particularly riveting although the comic turns of dancing elves are quite enjoyable.

Definitely watchable with the fam."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,This movie was hilarious!,"This movie was hilarious! not because it was Genuinely funny, but because it was done so poorly, the scripting and acting was poorly done, the singing was way over auto tuned, the dance Chorography was very stiff and childlike, overall if I could rate this a zero I would, but since I can't I will rate this a 1 cause at least it made me laugh.😂"
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Another Cinderella movie,"So yeah, it's another one of modern teen-Cinderella stories but this time not only with singing and dancing, but also with Christmas involved. Of course it's predictable and full of cliches, but what do you expect? It's pleasant, light and generally ok, even though the leads don't have much screentime together and the chemistry is so so, some of the secondary characters are overacting (as always in Cinderella movies). But well, if know what you're getting yourself into, or you're a minor then you might like it, and there's nothing wrong with it."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,I cringed through the entire movie,This was not a good movie. It was bad scripting and bad acting. There would be so many ways to make it better. I most say I loved the dog though.
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Cinderella,This lovely Christmas Cinderella story got very low marks but I really liked it and I thought the lead character was beautiful and a voice was awesome! I highly recommend this one to anybody who likes good Christmas stories.
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Not too bad!,"As far as Christmas movies go, the acting was quite good! The step family are hilariously nasty and the two main characters relatable in a sickeningly sweet way. Wouldn't watch again, but worth a go!"
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Shocking auto tune.,Comentario no disponible
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,MUTE the TV during songs!!,"This movie is pleasantly enjoyable, fun Christmas fluff, until they start a song. The autotune goes so far that it makes me wonder if a toddler got their hands on the equipment without anyone noticing until it hit the screen. It's a shame, too, because Laura Marano can definitely sing. It only ever got worse when they tried to pretend the characters were ACTUALLY singing. She's not an absolutely fantastic lip-syncer to start with, let alone when they're playing music that comes nowhere near something an actual human sounds like. Worth watching while making Christmas cookies though."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Going against the grain here but.. I liked it,I liked it. Its clean unlike most movies now days and the music was cute and cheesy!! It was a Christmas movie all around. Not the best one of the group but I feel it's better than the last one for sure .
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Shockingly bad,I only managed 15 minutes then I turned this off. Acting was bad and the singing and dance routines were horrendous.
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,I'm charming to...,"This is another addition to the Cinderella fad that keeps spinning endlessly. Sometimes it's worse than others. This movie felt like it wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. And I didn't from the beginning to the credits rolling.

It's a Christmas addition that I'm not sure worked given when the movie premiered on Netflix. But the leads are hilarious as they try to navigate the script and dialogue. A bit off kilter considering it's predecessors. But it is a comedy of sorts. It's definitely up there with a guilty pleasures viewing that you don't want to admit you like. Watch for a good laugh."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Cute!,"This movie is super cute! I bought it on a whim when I was shopping and I actually really enjoyed it. If you want to watch a sweet and simple holiday movie, this would be a good one to try. There were moments where it was a little much but honestly it wasn't too bad. Laura Marano and Greg Sulkin were pretty good and seemed to have pretty good chemistry while acting. I think it's worth a watch :)"
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,What happened to the DOG???,"This movie was terrible. The singing is awful at best, and the autotune is hard to listen to. However, my main concern is for the dog. At the end when the step-mother and sisters are getting their comeuppance, and Cinderella is being rescued, no one ever explains what happened to the dog. It kept me up all night. But hey, at least our Cinderella got her happily every after?"
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Cute,"I thought it was quite cute. It's a Cinderella story, so the plot is no surprise, but it's bright to look at and festive. The songs are heavily autotuned, so the criticism around that is warranted. But for a cheesy Christmas TV movie suitable for older kids but not so kidsy an adult watching would feel like poking their own eyes out, I thought this was decent. The aunt and horrible step sisters are amusing in how awful (and dumb) they are. Lead actress is okay, singing aside, short enough run time so as not to wear out its welcome."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,The worst Cinderella story ever,"Nothing to say. just horrible.That's all.

A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Good for kids,No bad words used. Simple Cinderella story a bit unreal kids would love it. I don't understand why people are giving 1 star. Grow up it's not meant for you.
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,"A great cast and idea, way too much autotune","I think the idea was great, the cast did a fantastic job, and the movie was cute with a reasonable amount of great song... BUT, the Auto-Tune killed it. Every time they sang I would think, oh what a nice.. Oh God, what is that horrible sound! Ugh stop!! The tunes were ruined with the Auto-Tune garbage and made the entire thing disappointing."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Absolutely awful,"Just awful. Script is horrible, acting is disastrous, directing was a whole crap show and a half. Also, what in the this gods given world was that autotuned, bland singing scene at the end of the movie? Would give it 0 stars if i could."
A Cinderella Story: Christmas Wish,Not bad but the vocals! Terrible,I think it was a cute over all movie. Musical which was fun. I just wish they didn't over process the vocals. It sounded like sad robots trying to sing. But I wish that they would have made it a little more natural.

Thomas & Friends,Used to be Great,"I used to be a fan of this show growing up. It has since gotten ridiculous ever since Series 7 started. The episodes before it were good and and worth watching. But we should be glad that the original writer of the books never lived to see how horrible the series became. There were a lot of good episodes near the beginning, even some after they stopped using the books as a source. But I can't watch the series anymore without wondering why the writers behind it still have a job in the television industry. There was a least some since of realism to the show before it became CGI. Unfortunately, they have since ruined the show and my childhood would be dumb if I were raised on the series as it is made today. It still gets half my vote as a good TV show, but the other half has been ruined by what the show has become."
Thomas & Friends,It was great for awhile.,"I will always have a love for Thomas the Tank Engine. This show's first few seasons are great! However, the show got worse over time, meaning a lot of the show's later episodes are not that good. If you wanna watch the show, stick to the original 7 seasons."

Thomas & Friends,A Great Show For All Ages,"Even though Thomas the Tank Engine is aimed at children, adults can enjoy it just as much as kids. That is because unlike many children's shows today, Thomas the Tank Engine does not dumb the show down to ridiculously low levels. Children of all ages, even infants, can learn lots of things by watching this show...possibly even more so than the dumbed-down kids shows they have now. All the characters are fantastic, and the setting looks so realistic and well designed. Although the show's golden years are probably over, its new episodes are still relatively decent. May Thomas the Tank Engine live on for generations and generations!"

Thomas & Friends,Thomas the tank engine,"I speak not only as a thomas the tank engine fan, but as a rail enthusiast and volunteer on a preserved railway, that thomas the tank engine is the best children's stories based on railways of all time. as i am myself a railway worker, i have been introduced to tasks and jobs that have been accurately included and described in thomas the tank engine, although the later stories are a bit of a disappointment to me as they seem to lack the element of the original railway knowledge and enthusiasm. but they are still very good stories and i will certain to say that i will indeed introduce thomas the tank engine to my children, and then the real thing of course as i have been. it did surprise me how real the stories really are, as many incidents and situations included in the stories are based on real locomotives and situations in the railway world, most children's stories are completely fiction and totally deny the gratitude and the commendation that they deserve for creating the 21st century possible. thank you reverand awdry for making my railway life a reality."
Thomas & Friends,Literally just nostalgia at this point,"It's weird to think that being born in the 2000s meant I was born just before the CGI era. But I'm glad to have been brought up with the cassette tapes of Series 1 to 4, then DVDs up to Series 11. Ofc after school and whatnot I watched the CGI era as a kid, but even then I still couldn't get over the fact I was so much more entertained watching prior seasons. The plot over time deteriorated in quality and was either too simple or just poorly written in general, especially once the CGI films began rolling out. Overall, this TV show will always have a place in my heart, but the difference in quality from past to present is a shame."

Thomas & Friends,"Classic series, that kids are guaranteed to love","I admit it, while I am 17 now, I am still quite found of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. And I loved it as a kid, in fact my whole family did, so much so my brother was literally obsessed with it, having his own Thomas train set and everything. This series is simply put a classic, with outstanding story ideas, and stay true to the brilliant stories by Reverend Wilbert Awdry. The setting for especially the Island of Sodor itself is fantastically done, almost exactly as I would visualise it. And the characters are engaging, from the main character down to the secondary ones. The Fat Controller/Sir Topham Hatt has a certain firmness but genuinely cares for the trains, who without a doubt steal the show. As much as I like James, Gordon and Percy, Thomas will always be my favourite. The music is memorable and easy for young toddlers to hum along too and the narration was perfect. If I did have a complaint, and a minor one, I do agree that the newer episodes are inferior in quality to the older ones, but they are still watchable. All in all, a must watch while you are growing up. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Thomas & Friends,"Started off amazing, got worse with time.","It would be an understatement to say that Thomas and Friends is the best show to come from Britain. And one of the best shows on P. B. S., only behind Mister Roger's Neighborhood, and Arthur. Seasons 1-7 were amazing, as they treated the kids with respect and didn't talk down to them. But geez! This show has gone downhill since then. I trace it back to when HiT Entertainment took over during the airing of season six, and the production of season seven. HiT destroyed everything good about the show, and essentially made the show for toddlers, instead of for all ages. But at least it was somewhat realistic in that the show still used model trains. But starting with season 13, HiT Entertainment decided to make the whole series in CG, effectively ending any appeal that it had towards adults. Then in season 17, Mattel bought HiT, and started to revitalize the show. But in season 22, they decided to throw away all of it and just got rid of Edward and Henry. This was the final nail in the coffin for the series, and in season 24, the show ended. And don't even get me started on the spinoff, All Engines Go."
Thomas & Friends,Didn't even like it as a kid,"Unfortunately, this show makes me fall asleep. Even when I was very young, I found it more boring than any other show. Usually I have a liking to shows for a younger audience, but every episode is almost the same in this show.

Whenever I watched Thomas, all I heard was ""Then there was trouble!"", ""You have caused confusion and delay"", and ""You are a really useful engine"". The plot is way too predictable and I get tired of the narrator saying these three phrases in every episode. He also talks way too slowly.

I do like the concept of talking trains and the scenery looks nice, but I do not think this stands out from any other kids' shows. It teaches nothing and is neither funny nor suspenseful. I have to say the CGI show is pretty impressive; I like how the characters actually have their own voices, and it's nice to see more movement rather than bland photos and non-moving face expressions.

It's fine if other people like this show, but based on my personal opinions even when I was young, this is a bad show."
Thomas & Friends,Best TV show ever.,"I'm currently 14 years old, and I still love this show, and I don't care what anyone else thinks. I've been a fan of ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" ever since I was born. In fact, I grew up with this show. It's about a blue tank engine named Thomas who lives on the Island of Sodor with all of his friends. He goes out on adventures whether pulling passengers or shunting freight cars in the quarry. I own a lot of videos and DVDs of this show, but the first Thomas tape I've ever watched in my life could be possibly ""Thomas Gets Tricked"".

My favorite character from this show would be Percy the small green engine. Some evidence from that is green is my favorite color and I like the number 6. My other favorite characters include James, Edward, Toby, and Thomas himself. Overall, ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" is a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by any person of any age. This is the best show ever.

Final Score: 100/100 (Awesome)"
Thomas & Friends,Amazing!,"Thomas the Tank Engine has been around on the television since 1984, and its clear to see why. Everything is made to a great standard of quality, and it offers a sense of originality.

Who would of thought that The Reverend Wilbert Awdry had originally only written these stories as bed time stories for Christopher Awdry, when he was ill. These stories were first written during the 1920's, and when they eventually got published into books, known as The Railway Series, and then onto television.

Although not all the stories are based on The Railway Series lately, they still have the same impact.

I think its safe to say that Thomas and his friends will be around for a very long time to come."
Thomas & Friends,my favorite childhood show a very good series,Thomas the tank engine is one of my favorite shows as kid and still is its number 3 of my favorite shows after doctor who and the simpsons I just a really big fan of Thomas as kid used to get the toys and the hornby models used to make up my own storys about them I do a series about them know and got three bachmann Thomas models which are Thomas James and Edward and I am planing to do my own layout with my train models I used to have the dvds of this series I had classic storys of Thomas of season 1 2 3 4 and 5 I also had season 6 and the movie okay the show is about Thomas a talking train who works very hard and finds out about things my favorite characters are Herny Edward Terrence Duck Percy Duke and almost all of the characters this is a great show for kids see you don't have to grow up soon you can be a boy and a girl you can never be old for this show okay some teenagers like ones who think they are really cool are going to be bored with it but if you have been a fan of this series even as a kid you will love it this show is just great and is very well done I give this show a 10 out of 10 very good.
Thomas & Friends,"Really cute, fun., and entertaining show","Wow! This is a really cute, fun, and entertaining show. I said that because I watch this on Nickelodeon and the Noggin network with my 2½-year-old nephew from time to time. It's hard to say which show on Nickelodeon and the Noggin network is the best. If I had to pick, this would definitely be one of the cutest. Still it's really cute, fun, entertaining, and educational. Also, it's hard to say which episode is my favorite. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the people at Nickelodeon and the Noggin network really know how to reach a toddler's developing mind. Now, in conclusion, if you have children, nieces, or nephews, I strongly recommend this really cute, fun, and entertaining. I guarantee you that they will enjoy it."
Thomas & Friends,A Wonderful Series For Toddlers As Well As Grownups!,"I never watched Thomas as a kid. I didn't know about Thomas the Tank Engine until several years ago. My son got into Thomas when he was about a year old. One of his playmates had a lot of Thomas trains and he played with them a lot whenever they saw each other. I thought that since my son liked playing with the trains, he might like watching the series. I bought him The Best of James on DVD and he loved it! He is now 18 months old, and he dances to the music in between each story. I like the series because it teaches kids about working together as a team, and lending a helping had when someone really needs it (like the time James' brakes were jammed and Percy had to come and rescue him, or when James realized he was going too fast because he had no driver and Edward had to come and rescue him)and the value of friendship and being honest."
Thomas & Friends,Classic is waaaay better,"I will speak on the Classic. Classic was the best in my opinion and despite its short 5.5 minute duration, I still loved the series. The plots were well set out and it is worth to see. Today, I still watch a newer episode every once in a while. Highly recommended to everyone, kids, adults etc."
Thomas & Friends,Now that's what i call a real work of art,This is better my 13th favorite show next to Unikitty and The Loud House even though i only like seasons 1 to 3 out of The Loud house and even way better than the reboot called Thomas And Friends All Engines Go created by Mattel and i love Thomas and it makes me wanna kill his all engines go counterpart with a 🔪.
Thomas & Friends,"Note, my 9/10 Rating is for Seasons 1-6/7","The classic episodes of this incredibly popular and widely loved TV show will no doubt be remembered for always and always and always.

They were full of life, loveliness, character... Beauty. Some of the shots were truly outstanding, and the models, the sets, the score- everything about the show was perfect. Then came HiT. I don't know what it is with them, they always seem to muck up perfectly good children's shows.

Everything was great until the series became... Not animated, but the visual effects were semi-CGI looking, not easy to describe. Anyway, *hrumph*, when looking back, the show was great until they changed things. Made it more kid-appealing. My, my, some of the earlier episodes were scary, and thinking back, the Ringo Starr episodes were only rated U- but later ones received a Uc rating, aimed specifically for children. This is when it went downhill. They started using new intros, partial CGI, and worst of all, a new intro song with children who are unbearably bad at singing. After lowering it lower than ever, they essentially spat on the Rev. W. Awdry's grave by adding an awful, truly AWFUL rap-but- not-quite-a-rap that goes on for far too long. Really, I watched it, thinking, ""Flippin' heck, ANOTHER verse?"" Truly awful.

Poor Michael Angelis, who, while narrating some of my favourite episodes, was dragged into this abysmally poor, modern, soulless production.

So, as I said in my summary, it's a 9/10 from me. But only, I repeat with utter sincerity, ONLY for series 1-7. Maximum. Anything past that is utter rubbish. 6/10 for the rest, up until The Great Discovery, which, from then on, will receive a 2/10, and that's only for poor Angelis' sake. No heart, no beauty, no models. In a nutshell, HiT took the series, demolished the steel foundations, which were strong and sturdy, and replaced them with their own inflatable ones, and had the gut, the indecency to call it a show.

And don't get me started on all the new, unimportant, crappy, worthless, useless, waste of space time, energy and breath that are the constantly-added new characters. Tell me, why do all of them sound mentally incapacitated? Even Gordon sounds like a retarded snob."
Thomas & Friends,Hand's Down. This is the best TV show in the history of television.,"Although I still have yet to read the Railway Series books, nothing beats this show. This is the only show that I fully pay attention to. It has everything, a fictional universe, intriguing characters, and a big impact on history. I was there for all the changes. I saw the shift from models to CGI, I heard Thomas speak for the first time, and I saw characters come and go and return. And here's something else, I'm 15 and I still ask for Thomas Wooden Railway toys to play with so I can recreate stories and make my own. Don't judge me. But the problem is this show doesn't get enough respect. I remember watching Thomas on PBS Kids, and guess what, they only aired it once a day. That's it. And Nick. Jr is doing the same thing. I need more Thomas. All in all, Thomas the Tank Engine is my favorite TV show to date. But, I'm still waiting for a theatrical movie where Lady returns. Come on, HIT I'm waiting. Anyone else?"
Thomas & Friends,"A Nostalgic, Classic Masterpiece!","Thomas & Friends is one of the best shows that teaches about Railway Logics and great morales, and some classic episodes in the show that are also based on Wilbert Awdry and Christopher Awdry's The Railway Series Stories."
Word Party,,
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Death has never been so funny,"To help her dad (and herself) cope with his declining health and eventual death, a woman stages fake accidents that kill her father. They're all fake, of course. They play to laughs, and inspire the title of the film, but they're really only a small aspect of the film on the whole. The story mostly focuses on their relationship and shows how special Dick Johnson is as a father, a grandfather, and a human being. He is lovable, hilarious, and perpetually happy. Everyone loves this man. You'll love him too. And you'll love this movie. It's an incredibly nuanced and intelligent examination of death, but it wisely disguises itself as a comedy so viewers can watch without openly weeping the entire time. In the end, you'll still cry, but you'll smile too."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,It's good but I know I'm missing something...,"It's rare that a movie with so much good stuff in it is also quite frustrating.

At the risk of going on too long: the main problem for me was the tone. The darkly comedic fantasy sequences never quite meshed with the far more effective (and more frequent) parts of the film that nakedly deal with the inevitability of death, and the immense struggles of aging. There was one fantasy sequence which was surprising moving in a really surreal way, until it clunkily featured an intentionally jarring gag, and I was pulled right out of feeling something profound.

I just... wasn't on this movie's level- I could tell I really liked it, and almost felt like I could love it, but it never sat 100% right with me. The whole premise of killing him in make believe ways never seemed to gel with the genuine emotions of the more down to earth stuff, and it left me a bit confused. There was surely an intent and a purpose, but it's one I can't grasp.

I know there's something here I'm missing, and the stuff I got I know I really liked, so I can still say it's a good movie for sure. But it's almost like I'm missing a part of my brain that would enable me to fully ""get"" this movie, y'know? Almost as confusing for me as I'm Thinking of Ending Things was 😅"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Bittersweet brilliance,"In what I think of as one of the greatest TV series of all time, The Leftovers, the show asks how we cope in the face of death, how the living keep going when there are no answers. In the docu-drama-hagiography-family-portrait Dick Johnson Is Dead, Kirsten Johnson is asking herself those same questions in the knowledge that her 86 year old father, Dick, has Alzheimer's. Having watched her mother's slow decline and disappearance due to the same disease, she knows the terrible fate that is coming, and she decides to record these final years with her dad as he is, as she wants to remember him.

The answers Dick Johnson is Dead comes up with are a far cry from the grieving tone struck by The Leftovers. If you read the above and thought ""Well that's going to be depressing""; you could not be more wrong. It is, of course, tinged with the anticipation of grief, but what shines through clearer than anything is the love Kirsten and Dick have for each other, and his unflappable, can-do spirit. This film is a celebration of the time that they have together, even though it may be ending.

Laced throughout footage of Dick selling up his house, packing up his office, and moving in with his daughter are strange fantasy sequences in which Kirsten stages her fathers death in a variety of ways. Some are outrageous, some are sad, but we are never asked to believe in them - throughout it is clear they are manufactured, and their purpose is to help Kirsten, and the audience, to imagine what it will be like when Dick finally does succumb to the inevitable. There are also fantasy sequences in which Dick imagines what it might be like when he arrives in heaven, with his wife, Freud, and Bruce Lee all waiting for him.

It's a bizarre choice that pays off handsomely. Death is always with us but we rarely look straight at it. Kirsten and Dick make a courageous decision acknowledge it, talk about it, visualise it. It suggests, despite our fears, that we can handle the worst life will throw at us. Principally though, this is a picture of a father and a daughter, of their quirky ways, and of the bonds that bind them.

The Leftovers ultimately suggested we are terribly alone in the universe, and we must fight hard to grab what life and love we can when we have the chance. Dick Johnson is Dead suggests that love is here with us right now, and we have only to open our eyes to see (and maybe make a home movie of) every precious second."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,A most unusual doc by a daughter who depicts her dad's death using him while alive. One of the best of the year and upbeat.,"Dying is about the deadliest topic in any medium partly because it reminds us of our last end, or as Alexander Pope said, ""Send not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee."" An accomplished documentarian, Kirsten Johnson, takes that topic and makes it a sweet future as she orchestrates scenarios for her father's death with him starring while alive in Dick Johnson is Dead.

It is as if she believes that playing with a bit of gallows humor might at least stave off the Alzheimer's disease for her dad that her mother succumbed to a few years ago. The magic part of this unusual documentary is the love of father and daughter evident in every light-hearted scene. Be he knocked dead by a construction beam or actually experience a heart attack, she and he are collaborating on this doc as professionals (he is a psychiatrist) who know enough about life to make death an acceptable adjunct to a life that was worth living.

Dick Johnson is not much as an actor depicting his own death, but he is a father who has loved his child, his late wife, and his friends, of which he has a multitude. His love shines through in each frame making this the most realistic fictionalized death on film this year (and most likely the only one).

My other favorite doc this year is David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet, which also defeats the death of earth through our own collaboration with Nature. In both films, life is affirmed in the face of daunting realities such as our responsibility for choking the atmosphere or just living till we die.

Kirstin's loving handling of a potentially crippling topic is a tribute to her as an accomplished filmmaker who can create in the face of heavy emotional weight. It is even more a tribute to her as a daughter who loves her father unconditionally and forever-a state she uses to keep her dad in her mind forever.

""Because I could not stop for death-He kindly stopped for me."" Emily Dickinson

Thanks to my daughter, Thea, who tipped me off to this exceptional doc-we share several sympathies with the film."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Thank you!,Loved it! THANK YOU for sharing your father and life with us. My wife and I loved your father and your story telling. We wish your father and family love and peace. Thank you.
Dick Johnson Is Dead,death march,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hal Ashby's 1971 cult classic HAROLD AND MAUDE takes a comical look at death, and in the process shows us the importance of living, and the jolt delivered by dying. Documentarian Kirsten Johnson (CAMERAPERSON, 2016) makes this a more personal project by involving her dad in a series of staged deaths for her film. Initially the purpose was to help him begin to deal with an end that could be coming soon, but it evolved into something altogether different.

Dick Johnson is an elderly psychiatrist. He's a charming and lively man, boasting a nice sense of humor and a twinkle in his eye. His daughter Kristen is ""a camera person"", and suggests to him that they make a film about him dying. He's on board. Kristen then stages various ""deaths"" for her father. These scenes include getting crushed by a falling air-conditioner, getting hit by a car, taking a horrific fall down stairs, and a construction site mishap. The more we get to know Dick, the more we like him. We learn it's been 30 years since he had a heart attack, and 7 years since his wife died. She suffered from Alzheimer's for years before she passed. We learn he's a Seventh Day Adventist, and loves chocolate fudge cake. My how he loves chocolate cake.

Initially gung-ho for his daughter's idea, and fully supportive of the situations she puts him in for her art, Dick begins to show signs of forgetfulness and confusion. At times we have our doubts that he fully comprehends what's happening - not just in the film, but in everyday life. The comical elements shift to wistfulness, as we are present when Dick has to shut down his practice, sell his car, and ultimately box up his belongings and move out of his beloved home. Kristen moves him to her one bedroom New York City apartment, which is right next door to that of the two fathers of her children.

In addition to the staged deaths, we also meet a stuntman who gets involved, and we are on set for the filming of Dick's ""Heaven"" which includes chocolate and popcorn, and his ""Last Supper"" featuring, among others, Bruce Lee, Frieda Kahlo, Farrah Fawcett, and Frederick Douglass. There is also a family trip to a beach in Lisbon, and a reunion with Dick's college girlfriend in California. The strangest bit is the staged funeral, replete with Dick in a coffin, and friends offering tributes. We also celebrate Dick's 86th birthday, and see many family pictures and home videos.

Leonardo da Vinci is quoted: ""As a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death.""

Watching Dick's spirit fade along with his memory is anything but happy. His daughter Kristen tries to remain sensitive to his changing state, but the feeling we are left with is anything but happiness towards death. Her film is likely structured much differently than she originally intended, but has so much value for discussion with loved ones and a reminder of just how precious life is for those who appreciate it. Now showing on Netflix"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,dour but fun,A thoughtful and heartfelt way to present the inherent aspect of life that is death
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Just Awesome!,"I had no idea what I was getting into when I started this on Saturday morning, but I'm so glad I did. Both sides of filming where so well put together. A different side documentary from a documentarian!"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Deadpan,"A movie about a retired psychiatrist named Richard Johnson who pretends to be a stiff, and there's not one dick joke. Freud is rolling over in his grave.

As made by his daughter, Kirsten Johnson, ""Dick Johnson is Dead"" is an amusing picture for a documentary about an old widower with worsening dementia moving into a one-bedroom New York apartment with his daughter who films different ways of killing him. The expounding on dying--you know, that everybody's doing it--isn't very profound. The brief overview of the Johnson family's Seventh-day Adventism even less so. The loss of memory is a bit more interesting as it relates to documentary filmmaking, and Kirsten's late mother and Dick's late wife's photography. At one point, Kirsten laments that the only film she made of her mother was when she was well into being affected by Alzheimer's Disease. Although it has been far from always the case, there is a general sense that photographs and motion pictures may outlive the people in them and the memories thereof. Appropriately, then, the documentary is made in the reflexive mode, exposing the filmmaking process, including the staging of Dick's death scenes, and including the filmmaker as a heard and seen presence in the picture.

Apt as much of that is, what really sells ""Dick Johnson is Dead"" is the charm of its eponymous would-be corpse. This guy has life figured out. Eat chocolate cake and ice cream and crack jokes with friends and family, don't let stuff bother you too much, and if you're not sure what to do, take a nap or watch TV. The movie may get carried away with some of the heavenly imagery and interludes with cutouts and at other times not seem to be going much of anywhere, but it's worth sticking around for that wisdom from the demented dead man."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,"Highly original, heart-warming","I rated this an 8 because, while it's not the world's best documentary, it is completely original, and thought-provoking despite its seeming simplicity. You'll fall in love with Dick Johnson as soon as you meet him, with his childlike, wide-open smile and merry eyes. That love only deepens throughout this funny and awe-inspiring film (for me, especially in the sneak-peeks into the filmmaking process, including the practice of various stuntmen hired to simulate Dick's deaths). The use of color is also highly entertaining, and the voice-over narration by the filmmaker (Dick's daughter) is concise and intelligent without being condescending to the viewer or mawkish about her dread of her father's decline and eventual demise. This film asks viewers how we'll all cope with the passing of a beloved parent, and prepare for our own unknown end."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Dick Johnson is Dead,"Dick Johnson is Dead was a good documentry in which one we are watching a family and a daughter preparing its father for his death but in a very fun and enterteining way that had both sweet and sad moments in it and in end i must say that i liked this project.The said story was very nicely written and directed and even if im not a big fan of this kind of movies,i must admit that i really liked this one and what was happening on screen,ending of a movie was also very nicely done and it showed us how actually feels to lose someone that we love and how painful that can be.Dick Johnson is dead was a good documentry"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Truly special,"I have never seen a movie like this one. It's extremely personal and it tackles a heavy subject in a strange way. Somehow, it all works extremely well."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,A unique examination of life and death that is juggling too many elements,"Death and coming too terms with ones mortality has been explored numerous times across various cinematic mediums and genres but the subject has never really been tackled like it is here in the very personal and heartfelt Dick Johnson is Dead.

One of 2020's most highly praised documentaries that has been distributed through Netflix, Johnson is a mix of humorous insight, deep and meaningful ponderings and intimate family explorations of director Kirsten Johnson's life as a daughter dealing with her elderly father Dick's increasingly fragile mental and physical state as the two agree to film various scenarios and real life escapades that delve into Dick's life and also his impending passing.

It's a well meaning affair, with both Johnson's making for likeable and open centerpiece to the film but its hard to fully invest in this feature as its focus consistently wavers between events, with it often struggling too juggle its tones and events that don't always gel into the cohesive whole that would've made this documentary an unforgettable experience.

Not at all seeking to explore Dick or Kirsten's life in any great depth, Johnson flips between humorous imaginations of Dick's death that are Chaplin like in the conception, conversations with Dick about his life and learnings and also scenarios that are proposed to mentally prepare Kirsten and Dick for what is to come but none of these elements are given proper time to breathe with a scattershot approach to Johnson's narrative drive never allowing us the proper time and experience that some of the best documentaries manage to do.

Everything here comes from a place of true and honest intent and some of the surreal scenarios that Kirsten conjures up (hello slow-mo foot wash) make for a unique viewing experience but you can't help but feel as though more time getting too know who these people are and exactly what we are exploring about Dick's condition could've benefited greatly for a film that is always watchable but not always entirely engaging or as impactful as it could've been.

Final Say -

Raising some intriguing questions about facing death and the importance of acceptance of ones circumstances, Dick Johnson is Dead is a unique documentary and sometimes an insightful one but its messy approach to its material and scattered concepts hold it back from being a deeply emotional or mandatory viewing experience.

Dick Johnson Is Dead,Underwhelming,"Dick Johnson seems like a very nice guy, and it was very nice of him to do this with his daughter. Kirsten Johnson seems like a very nice woman, and this film is like a valentine to her Dad. But now we come to the film itself, which I wanted to see because the overwhelming majority of professional critics loved it. And honestly, I have no idea why. While the film had its moments, much of it was pretty boring, especially the slow-motion fantasy sequences with glitter in the air.

This film kind of reminded me of Sarah Polley's, ""Stories We Tell,"" which was another personal story about something that happened to her family. Good people, but unless you knew the family, I didn't think it was very interesting. Most film critics inexplicably loved that one too."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Thank you Kristen,"Having lost both of my Aunts to Alzheimer's and my Mother in just a few years, I wished that I had captured their last years better. To be able to let them pass gradually with no regrets. Rather than wishing you had more time. Would have been wonderful."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Love above death,"Beautiful and touchy. You will be cry and laugh at the same time. Long live Dick Johnson. You will never died, because you always here in hearts."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Kind of Boring,"I think this documentary could be cut shorter. I didn't care much about the characters or the plot. It looks like more a family ""thing"" than a documentary.

Kind of boring."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Betwen Parent and Child and Death,"IN BRIEF: Unique and insightful, this documentary becomes a loving tribute to a father and daughter coping with aging and death.

JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) The flip side of tragedy is comedy and this documentary takes a wry look at America's fascination with death and our inability to grieve. Filmmaker Kirsten Johnson (and her living father) create a macabre documentary that is a coping mechanism for just that. Once a successful psychiatrist and happily married man, Dick Johnson is in his waning years. Now forced to move in with his filmmaking daughter and her family, he accepts these unforeseen changes with grace and dignity and decides to team with her to envision his own life, death, and numerous resurrections.

Ms. Johnson tries to deal with her father's aging issues, including memory loss, and uses her filmmaking skills as a means to cope with this depressing subject and honor her father. Both use their sardonic views about his future demise and decide to stage various scenes of his exit to the afterlife in gory details. Their collaborations provide a droll sense of humor as these grisly filmed events reveal more about their loving relationship and the onslaught of his increasing dementia than further possibilities of his future demise. Their absurd executions and glittery ascents into the afterlife become delightful interludes from the real world.

The filmmaking is, at times, crude and raw, but Ms. Johnson adroitly blends wonderful surreal visions into her fantasy world that make one quickly discern the true depth of her creative madness. It is uniquely her own perspective that sets this documentary apart from all others. In between her many staged death scenes, we glimpse the crux of her story, honoring a beloved man who once was and can never be. Aging may have changed his purpose in life, but his love of daughter and family remains steadfast and guides him and his filmmaking child through these bleak times.

With an abundance of wit and social irony, Dick Johnson is Dead becomes a celebratory tale with equal portions of love and death. Its unique viewpoint is a cinematic rarity, a fascinating glimpse into the human spirit and bond between parent and child. It's a lovely testament for us all. (GRADE: B+)"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Novel take on aging is a bit too slick,"Acclaimed Documentary filmmaker Kristen Johnson was inspired to follow her father, Dick, as he began to show more and more signs of mental and physical deterioration. The result is, this, a somewhat light-hearted attempt to de-mystify the aging process. Johnson's method involves a lot of staged sequences including bizarre ""accidents"" that could kill him.

By all accounts, Dick Johnson seems like an amiable chap. A psychiatrist. Family man. About half the Doc follows how Alzheimer's increasingly takes it toll on him, and some of the footage is honestly heart-breaking. But, it's the staged material which has garnered the most attention. It is certainly laudable for a filmmaker to think outside the box as to how to shape her material. Still, as an established documentarian (and cameraperson), it's still seems incongruent that so much of the movie is given over to flights of fantasy. A little of it goes a long way here.

As with her previous Doc CAMERAPERSON, Kristen Johnson is too self-conscious behind the camera. She should trust not only her own instincts and let the images do the taking, but, also those of her audience. One moment, we are witnessing Dick slowly losing his memories, and then the next he is being used as a human prop gussied up like a circus puppet as a cascade of confetti floats around him in slow motion. It's all too slick. Even more damning, it goes against the stated theme of accepting illness and, inevitably, death. Of course, Kristen doesn't want to see her father leave her, but, all of the faked footage and audience deception does make it feel as though the Doc was more about her than her beloved dad. Dick Johnson seems to accept his fate better than this movie does."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Time to go,"Do you mind the macabre? There was an episode of Life in Pieces that showed what would happen during the funeral of one of the main characters. It was bizarre to say the least. It is even more bizarre seeing this being subject of a whole documentary.

Suspending your disbelief is one thing. Being able to follow with what the filmmaker (and daughter) set out to do a completely different story alltogether.

Visually stunning this has them film a few scenes where we see how the father, who slowly is losing his mind - well no pun intended, it is dementia - might die.

Very weird, very strange, but well orchestrated. Even some stunt man are being hired. But sometimes he has to be in the center of it. And he seems quite confused about one scene where he has a fake blood bag on him that is supposed to squirt blood because he was hit ... all stunts. But he seems to believe they have his blood or will need it.

This adds to his character and that of the movie I reckon, but again you have to be down with stuff like that. And even the ending ... the end? ... is something that is either very emotional or just plain strange.

It surely is not for everyone - especially considering how it is all handled. But as already mentioned there are some very great visual treats here. One where he is floating, one with Jesus (an actor of course) and some others thrown in for good measure."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Loved This Doco!,"Extra Sentimental Becoz of my Dads passing!

A sad but must see on how Dementia or Alzheimers can have a massive burden on the family. I've seen this with Grandparents and really is one of toughest watches to see your Nana completely lose memory.

It begins with Dick's journey at the very early stages! Daughter Kirsten balances Directing & Daughter duties for it for it to be informative plus add the comedic side which really lightens up the subject topic.

The final scene was super tense and his best friend's eulogy then playing the flute had me a type of a way lol.

Overall Thank you Dick & Kath for inviting us on this Journey. God Bless"
Dick Johnson Is Dead,A Dad's Undying Love,"More filmed memoir than documentary perhaps? And certainly not for everyone. If you are a person who can laugh at death (or like me try to fake it), then this film likely will work for you.

It's hard not to be charmed by the title character and fading father of the filmmaker. The film may be most famous for hits spectral speculations, both stunt-flirting with death as well as opulent shots of an imagined afterworld. There is also an odd sort of road trip retreating back to an old Adventist flame of Dick's. That felt a little out of place to me but I guess helped to flesh out the film length, and maybe was a nice sort of reward for the filmmaker's father. We also get a sort of drive-by on Kirsten's next-door family.

Was recommended, with some caution, by a person on a basketball blog/chat space. And I do think caution is advised. Flowers for Algernon vibes - dementia sure seems like a rough coda to any life.

For me the film had three phases - the staged deaths reminded me of how ""Six Feet Under"" would anecdotally start. (Add in the psychiatrist parent aspect in both ?!?) Those ""skits"" keep coming through-out but the film moves into a more pensive phase - remembering the wife/mother who I think appeared in Cameraperson, or some other film and who tragically foreshadows some of the loss of personal freedom and flat-out person-hood closing in on Dick.

Ultimately the redeeming phase underscores Dick's undying love for his daughter (and his wife and his friends and even patients) truly makes the movie. I think of raucous comics, out-there musicians, performance artists, game show contestants and other demonstrative beings, and wonder if many also had such doting audiences from day one?

I understand some of the questioning of the filmmaker's motives, but to Kirsten's credit she did have her Father not just move near her, but move in with her. So even if/when the film feels manipulative, there were undoubtedly many unrecorded moments, joyful and onerous.b

My guess is her Dad happily traded all of those for the same time in a ""care facility."""
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Favorite film of the year,"I was blown away by this movie. I am so happy that I saw it in a listing of Emmy Nominees. I may have missed this otherwise. This was a pure gem. I just watched this, and I am still crying. It was beautiful, heartfelt, funny and real. I fell in love with Dick Johnson. He reminded me a little of my dad - self effacing, funny, kind, considerate and loving. My dad passed away in 1998 at the age of 69 from a heart attack due to Type 1 Diabetes. I am not sure if I am crying partly for the loss of my wonderful dad or the thought of this wonderful man passing away. I love you, Dick Johnson, and I love this gem of a movie. <3 <3 <3. Your daughter Kirsten is pretty special also."
Dick Johnson Is Dead,Average...,"""Dick Johnson Is Dead"" is a Documentary in which we watch a daughter preparing her father for his death. She tries to help him through some different actions because he starts having signs of dementia.

I did not have high expectations from this documentary because I was not sure what I was exactly about to watch. The direction which was made by Kirsten Johnson was good and she presented very well the portrait of her father, his history and love was present through the whole duration of the film. She also presented very well her family and the importance of her father and at the same time the difficulties that has to overcome. Dick Johnson followed her guidance through the whole duration of the documentary and seemed to enjoy every moment of it. Lastly, I have to say that ""Dick Johnson Is Dead"" is a different documentary but unique for this family."

Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Half-baked world of crime, well-defined performances!","Jamtara introduces us to a new but half-baked world of phishing fraud. But at the same time it introduces us to some new raw talent of actors who give compelling performances.

The phishing fraud is touched only on a peripheral level with a group of village kids calling gullible customers from metro cities and asking for their credit card details to make fraudulent purchases. In reality, am sure, the phishing fraud has more to it. However this aspect doesn't hurt much as phishing is only used as a backdrop to this crime caper which has the regular trappings of ambitious kids hoping to make quick money, a corrupt politician, a new cop trying hard to cleanse the village, gang war between rivals, et al. In that respect the show creates a crime world of its own like 'Mirzapur' though the treatment is not pretentious like 'Sacred Games'. While the makers do not break new grounds in coming up with a crime world which we haven't seen earlier, they do present what they have with grit and conviction.

Most episodes of around 20-25 minutes are an easy watch and have interesting hook points ensuring you binge watch to an extent. Unlike other shows that come up with superfluous subplots to fill up runtime for around 10 episodes, here the narrative doesn't stray far. The main characters are well-etched. The pace drops and the flow goes a little abrupt in the last couple of episodes. And just when you start rooting for the protagonist despite him being an archetypal anti-hero, the show ends with an abrupt moral tone of 'crime-never-pays'. The end however is more conclusive as compared to other shows in the genre that end midways to make route for a second season.

Technically the show is well-crafted and the performances are a major highlight. Sparsh Srivastava as the lead is superb. Anshuman Pushkar as his rival has a hangover of Vivek Oberoi in his looks and Manoj Bajpai in his acting. His character however doesn't get much scope after the first few episodes. The female cast have strong characterization with Aksha Pardasany and Monika Panwar giving nuanced performances. Amit Sial glides smoothly through the role of a corrupt politician. Dibyendu Bhattacharya as the conflicted cop is also good.

Jamtara is a show that you will enjoy while you watch but might not stay with you long after."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,A phishing scam that will have you hooked!,"If you are looking for a crime series that will focus on the part of daily lifestyle, you are going to enjoy it. Jamtara crafts crisp episodes with dramatic hooks and mounting tension that urges you to click on ""Next episode""."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Good Acting with story line but something seems incomplete,Worth a shot... Dont keep expectations but it's good acting show... But seems something is missing at the end little bit of incompleteness.
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Season 2: Interesting but deviates away from what it should be,"I think after Season 1, the way season 2 progresses and ends, it is safe to say, Jamtara is no more a series based on phishing but rather a political / relationship story set in the backdrop of these scams.

S2 starts off from where it left with Sunny injured on the leg following the S1 climax night. This time they introduced few new characters, including Seema Pahwa who is against the wicked Brajesh Bhan (Amit sial) in the elections. What follows is a lot of madness, murders, kidnappings, scams and a search for who scammed the CM wife of 23 lakhs, the biggest ever done in Jamtara.

This season too is very interesting thanks to the very interesting screenplay which rarely dips. But this time they packed in sooooo many subplots that it is sometimes not easy to keep track of what is happening. A lot of commotion starts as the season progresses . What i dont like is the series starting to take the political route too much deviating away from scams as its major plot. The scams basically drive the political plot forward and also the CM scam one which forms another plot of investigation.

Point to note, this time, a lot of interesting scams are shown but in a shallow way but its ok i can understand now this series is no more to show you scams in detail (maybe it was never). Nevertheless, you will be invested in the proceedings despite flaws.

Performances. I hope Amit Sial doesnt get type casted into these villianish political characters (like his character from Maharani). But Amit Sial is just terrific. The hatred for his character is fanned so well, i cannot imagine anyone play this role other than Amit sial. He is a gem of an actor. Sparsh Shrivastava gets little screentime this season as compared to previous one but Monika as Gudia gets more screentime and she does a very good job. Aksha as inspector Dolly too does a great job as a non nonesense cop. Anshuman Pushkar gets an interesting role this season and he becomes the point of interest for S3 later. Others have done a fine job too ."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,This series reflected my story 8 years ago,"Until few years before, many people were not aware of this despicable place. I have been to this place few times not because I am near to this place or went for official or vacation -- I was forced to visit this place after being ripped off my life and money. Mass banking fraud happened only during last 5-6 years, after which this place came in the national media attention. But back then 8-9 years before, they did many other techniques to defraud people.

One among the victim was myself who became a victim of admission fraud. I hail from one of the remote village in North West India. I was 19 years old then, just completed my H.S school and gave medical entrance exam. My parents are poor and uneducated. It was in 2011, one fine morning these scumbags called me and inform me that I was being selected to one of the medical college in West Bengal through (AIPMT medical exam) charity quota. Back then I was not aware of anything, neither my poor parents are. They asked college admission and hostel admission will cost 4 Lakhs. They mailed me all the fake admission letters and documents of the college. Being village kid and from uneducated parents, we believed and transferred the full amount to these scambags. My parents are poor, barely has 10k in account had to sell lots of land to collect those money.

Then after a week, we are ready to reach the college for admission, I along with the cousin bro came to one of the college they sent us to. When we reached the college, i tried to call the number, but it's being permanently switched off. Then we went to admission cell and enquired, learning that all those papers were fake and there exist no such quote(charity quota for poor).

By then I was crying like hell, knowing what will my parents feel about it after selling the property for all these. More so, I'd have been okay if only lost money but i also lost one year of my career.

Next day, we went to police station to file FIR but they don't take cases just because we don't belong to that place. We are helpless by then. Next we went to ICICI bank to know the address of the receiver. Bank insisted we need to show FIR copy to get customer address details. But we clearly said to officials that we come from different state and police is not filing FIR. After narrating all the story one of the employee told us to wait, promising us to give the address by talking to manager. We got the address details of that scumbag, having two residential address one in jharia, another jamtara (nearby to each other), and his bank account in Asansol (west bengal 1 hour drive to Jharkhand bordering there). We went to that to their residential address but none of them exist, they are all fake and no such person exist there. They opened bank account with fake documents. That's it!

Travelling back to home was one of the longest journey in my life. Felt like I have been travelling to destination for 100 years. Since then my career affected everything, I am still not able to get out of that mesh and end up doing nothing substantial in life. Not just this story, it happened lot lot more than what I wrote here. But that's left for another day.

I want to burn down that entire region who are destroying the lives of millions. I never fail to understand why banks and institutions are spending billions to secure their banking fraud. Spend few crores and try help to nab and execute those scumbags there. These people are now spreading in entire country and teaching to other people in another region."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Good begining but the end was awful,I can't believe that something which begin so beautifully and was progressing so interestinly had such a cringy and awfully ending. Last two episodes were just horrible and make me wonder that it had the same writer and director who wrotes the first eight episodes. How can all that change so abruptly or some kind of favioratism were done at the end. Anshuman and Aparsh had done wonders with their acting and so did Dibyendu but Amit Sial was the star such a wonderful actor. Monika and Aksha were good but their characters in the end just got unnacessary importance and had change the plot for the worst. Just awful
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,A must watch .,"I really don't understand why some of the reviews given above are negative , I found this series so indulging and intense and gripping that I completed it in around 4 hour. The amazing part is the around by character which is amazing , the cast , the lose lose point where nothing is going right all , it's not fully digestible but a perfect series. Kudos to jamtara team and Netflix ."

Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Full entertainment, worth watching.","Loved the series. couldn't stop myself to complete in single day. Very well acted. Specially by Bhaiyaa jee ""Amit Sial"". I think no one can act better then him when it comes to an role of an ""Bahubali politician or Upper caste in society "". He really brings acting into reality. And i also loved the part of those two friends telling Mahabharat story Every time, they acted like catalyst."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Jam'tara' flickers in dark !!!,"The dark side of rural India depicted pitch perfect. Director has researched the case & has penned a decent drama. Dialogues are well written & cast delivers in authentic Gangs of wasseypur flavour (warning : full of colourful language). Grim reality of Indian youth trying to get out of poverty on a wrong path, cyber crime laws & darker politics jamtara leaves you with a lot to ponder on as it doesn't touch details.Also it could have been crisper & phishing could have been made a centre plot instead of using it as add-on to a village crime drama.

Verdict : You can binge this Star performer's Jamtara"
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Awesome show, better than Sacred Games",Every episode is awesome and makes you wanna see the next episode. Acting is awesome and subtle. Ending could have been better. I felt it better than Sacred Games as the dialogs give a genuine feel.
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Disappointing end to season 1,"I started watching this series recently and was so mesmerized by its star cast. Characters were real and well played. Story was fine but the dialogues will blow you away. Gudiya asking ""Chuitye ho kya"" with straight face is not something you will see in too many series. Alas the series lost its initial verve and just meandered to nothingness towards the end. Perhaps I am expected to see season 2 but they lost me towards the end of season 1. This remains a problem with Netflix series where they start strong and then just lose steam without reaching anywhere. Disappointed, by what could have been a great series but wasn't."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Not a cyber crime story,"This series is not about cyber crime happening from jamtara. It's about a corrupt politician who is involved in phishing. 90% of the focus is on politian, gang rivalries, petty fights and how to capture the politician. Very less scope is given to show how phishing is done in jamtara . Every episode has 1 phishing call where scammer gets the credit card details.

There is no details about how phishing started in jamtara, how they get phone numbers, how they get so many sim cards, how they transfer the amount to bank accounts , how the scam is tracked to jamtara etc. Focus is only on the crime after phishing is done and its after effects. Cast is also a let down. Sp dolly was total misfit and also the cyber research guy.

This series is a big let down from Netflix. It's just another series about corrupt politician. The videos related to this series in YouTube from Netflix is much more better. Those who are expecting series about cyber crime , avoid this."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Bore very much boring,Really want to see this series as this was available on netflix.they are dragging the series with no story at all.the idea of the series was good actors are good but toouch boring.
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Just blown away by the Performances,Just fantabulous performances and a gripping thriller
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Gripping story, stupid mistakes",Comentario no disponible
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Captivating story of crime and power,"From episode one to the end of the last season, it is quite captivating and thrilling. The portraying of political anarchy is too accurate and cruel which may get on the audiences' nerve. A great crime thriller. Although the focus has shifted from the protagonist to side characters in season 2, but it does not impact the story a bit. Introduction of new characters and the flow of story is very well depicted. A good watch that can keep one hooked from the beginning to end. I hope there would be one more season (s 03) to end up the story with a proper finishing. Nevertheless, the script and story is very captivating."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Not Up To Netflix Standards,"The plot lacked intensity and momentum. Storyline was quite plain but still binge-worthy. Acting and direction were great This would have been excellent for a youtube web series but it's not up to the Netflix standards. Mirzapur being in same genre, is much better."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Intriguing, Season 2 is better than season 1","Watch it without any hesitation, you will binge watch it. Every episode will keep you on edge of your seat, surely season 3 will come. Character development of gudiya is interesting. They could have easily added one more episode to show the outcome of aftermath, it would have been lot of fun to watch. Nevertheless Ajit andhare did a good job and acting is top notch. Sunny was bit underutilised but given his situation it was understandable. Can't wait to watch season 3, I hope they start working it on soon. They can do so many things in upcoming seasons as the news scams have come in market again."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Disappointing,"A very interesting premise turned into a love story , the premise is quickly lost. Could have been really good had they explored the premise more. It's window dressing hiding a dull story not worth a whole season leat alone 1 episode."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Best Acting I've ever experienced,"The Acting in this series makes it 10/10 rating but the first season reduced the overall rating to 9/10, the second season is 10/10.

You can truly feel and experience the acting when you feel the emotions portrayed like anger,hate,love,brotherhood etc.

Fantastic storyline, cinematography and direction.

No loopholes, no misses. The cast is amazing and the experience is thrilling throughout the season.

You will definitely love it if you loved ""Mirzapur"" ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" etc. As this is very closely related.

The main cast is very talented actors which makes this show great !

Can't wait for another season.

10/10 Must watch."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,Potential but predictable,"Being born in the same state Jharkhand, had just heard of the city named Jamtara, but never knew such true events did occur there. It just shows if you provide unlimited data to Young kids without proper guidance, such scams do take place. Coming to performance, the cast was perfect each and every one played their role perfectly. The story is somewhat predictable as you pass one episode after the other. Some village scenes that were shot were repetitive. Long pauses and pace was slow. Could have winded the episodes to 6-7 instead of stretching it to 10 episodes.

It's not a series I would say that you should definitely binge. But you can give it a go if you like rural tales, strong language and performances."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Starts off very Promisingly, gets nonsensical towards the end","The characters completely betray their build up in first few episodes and act opposite to what they were shown as, towards the end. Apart from cashing on the sensation of the subject of Phishing scams, you realise there is not much to it once you finish watching the whole season."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"Good, Could have been better","I enjoyed it. As this series is based on fishing scam, they should have shown more about fishing and its outcome on poor victims for awareness."
Jamtara – Sabka Number Ayega,"I rarely watch Hindi TV Series, but this is a in a league of it own","Hats off to the screenplay writer, cinematographer, director, dialog writer and above all - the actors.

The actors in particular have put their hearts and soul in the series, Season One was good, but Season Two is mind blowing - not a minute of slack, I binged watched the entire second season in 2 sittings.

The acting was so realistic that as better than some of the Hollywood movies and series I have watch lately.

Great team and great storyline - a must watch for everyone both as a means of entertainment as well as knowing what is phishing, phone scams and above all the rotten system of democracy in India."

The Glory,This is outstandingly good! Well done team Korea for producing yet another fantastic TV series!,"American TV take note. The Koreans are producing some outstanding films and TV shows and The Glory is a shining example of this.

This is the first Korean TV series my wife has seen and with the last episode still to play out, she is already a fan of them.

The Glory achieves exactly what you want from a TV show like this... something you look forward to watching at the end of a busy day. It's so engaging that we have been watching 2 to 3 episodes each night, with almost no distraction from our mobile/cells phone.

The story its self has several levels to it and goes deeper than what I was expecting... and where I would normally expect a twist (had it been an American series) The Glory show catches me off guard by playing out exactly as it should do.

The sole reason for removing 1 star is it does feel a little drawn out at times, but oddly, it also works as at no time did I feel bored watching it.

As a result The Glory comes Highly Recommended!"
The Glory,Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Cold,"You think Penthouse: War In Life (2020) or The World Of The Married (2020) was brutal enough?! Well, then you'll have to see this one. First 30 minutes of 1st episode was really hard to watch, not because it's bad, but because it's so good potraying how brutal high school bullies can be.

And forget Song Hye Kyo as a ""South Korean Melodrama Queen"". Here she's poignant and dark due to her character's constant bullying in high school. You'll only see her smile after 20 minutes into the 2nd episode and laugh after mid 5th episode. Yeah, that's how bleak The Glory is.

And season finale, 8th episode was a cliffhanger. Season 2 will be aired on March 2023. I can't wait to see how glorious Dong Eun revenge would be!

Must See 9/10."
The Glory,Elaborate and heartbreaking revenge. First binge watching in nearly 4 yrs,"It's a very particular revenge story different from any other one in the market present. Directing, script and casting are all GOOD. Love the the storytelling and Kyo's facial expressions and the atmosphere she exudes especially. The relationship between every characters are interesting to watch and won't feel dull, among which, the chemistry between DongEun and the maid I like the most, like a dim light in the dark night. Humanity warmth and thoughtfulness inadvertently and naturally reveal when DongEun and the maid meet. The Glory is all in cool tone, black, blue, purple, even red is in blue tone, which I really love. And OST cannot be not mentioned. Not only the songs but also the background music are very compatible and appropriate for the story and atmosphere."
The Glory,slayyyyyyyyy,"It is one of the best k-dramas in recent years I feel like the plot of the story is incredible and how she executes her revenge is it's just so satisfying to watch seeing her executing and how she works just a masterpiece. They tried to slow her down but she was playing chess while the others were playing checkers.likee she was always 2 steps ahead of them. She deserved her glory and her bullies got what they deserved. The storyline is wonderful the development of the story is awesome. I love how people were willing to help her to reach her goal and how she was so determined not only to avenge herself but her classmate who was bullied. She is so admirable. I love her character and the development of the story.10/10, would recommend it if you like thrillers and a little bit of cutesy stuff in between, also the acting was impeccable on all parts every one completed their assignment."
The Glory,A trigger warning but a brilliantly play the game of go,Comentario no disponible
The Glory,You reap what you sow,"A fascinating watch thanks to the solid script, dynamic directing, and stellar acting. Every single one of the cast members gave their utmost performance, making each episode feel intense and mind-blowing in the right balance. My respect for Kim Eun-sook, she didn't shy away from antagonizing the main characters because truly, you reap what you sow. The only thing I wish they'd done differently was to cast someone older for Joo Yeo-jung for a more balanced pairing with Song Hye-kyo, because let's be real; she had more solid chemistry with Jung Sung-il as Ha Do-yeong than with Lee Do-hyun. Overall, a highly recommended drama. Pinnacle of revenge."
The Glory,I don't leave reviews but this show was awesome.,"Revenge has never been so sweet. It's refreshing and everyone are such great actors. The plot has you at the edge of your seat, wondering how to puzzle pieces will fit together. Its dark but not too dark and has some dark humor as well. I am looking forward to part 2. The characters are complex and interesting. The main character is broken and battered. And and the revenge plot is complex and intricate and don't expect a resolution in 8 episodes. The music the camera angles are just right and makes for very entertaining tv. I definitely recommend watching this show and you will not be disappointed."
The Glory,Solid acting and storyline,"It has been a while since I've seen a K-Drama and have to admit, this was exceptionally well done. Hye-kyo was incredible and the rest of the supporting cast was flawless.

The story builds nicely and a nice justaposition between the main story and a side love story as well. Insanely beautiful actors and nice use of props as well.

Note: there are definitely some scenese that are hard to watch due to the violence so be forewarned. Still, it is absolutley necessary and I won't call it excessive.

Pretty amazing how quickly 8 episodes flew by. Simply brilliant acting and writing. Can't wait for the rest but an easy 10/10 stars for me."
The Glory,Brilliant! Highly recommend,"Brilliant work is the least I could say to describe this drama . The plot, acting, cinematography everything was top notch .

One of the best 2022 dramas so far and it's so easy to watch u are hocked from the first minute without a moment to feel bored I just hoped we got both parts I don't want to wait lol, The acting from all characters was amazing the young actors played their parts very good .

Song Hye Kyo did a fantastic job with this role in portraying the trauma and the scares that something like violence will leave on u . I really loved her chemistry with both Do Hyun and specially Jung Sungil , I would love to see them in another project in the future .

Hats off to all actors really

Of my my fav seances that captures the cinematography of this drama , is the changing of seasons while playing with Do hyun + the seamless transition between the younger and older characters.

Big salute to Kim Eun Sook for always making the best dramas, really thank you."
The Glory,"Waiting for part 2, it lost me in the middle","So the series starts well, as well as revenge story can go. After the first episode you find yourself both excited for some deserved belated retribution and horrified at what you've just witnessed. The plan is in motion, even if it takes 18 years.

We are following Dong-Eun as she climbs step by step towards her revenge and all is well. She makes the contact with her targets, you wait with baited breath for her next move. And then - the action slows, threads get intertwined and more and more characters have something to say. It's harder to make mental notes of what our protagonist is trying to achieve and a bit wild that noone is really pulling the strings to stop her so far. Everyone has a hidden story and it's getting messy keeping the tabs on all of them. At times it seems they are walking in circles and waiting. At times it's a bit confusing too. I've found myself speeding up to get to the end only to find out that it's not the end at all. Always check if the series you're bringing is finished.

I hope the second part will be better. It seems like they are capable of very dark things and I got the impression that's where we're headed. I just found myself dissappointed at how muddy the middle part got and I really hope the script will be sharp and crisp for the next part. This series has a potential for exceptionally twisted story, otherwise it's another dull revenge plot."
The Glory,The Glory (2022),"""There will be no forgiveness, and so... there will be no glory either."" - Moon Dong-eun

The Glory is a South Korean television-series written and executive-produced by Kim Eun-sook, molding a harrowing tale about a disfigured victim of high-school violence that carefully plots her revenge against those who have wronged her. Song Hye-kyo delivers a commendable leading performance as the scorned woman, Moon Dong-eun, who has cashed in all her chips toward this path of no return. Ahn Gil-ho provides masterful direction for the series. Allowing the viewer to take a backseat to this grand scheme orchestrated by Dong-eun, narrating every step of her growth to the leader of the oppressive group, Park Yeon-jin (Lim Ji-yeon) whom I must admit was the perfect choice to portray an apathetic villainess. The casting for this series is impeccable as the performers handle their roles seamlessly. The storyline provides a valuable lesson to the audience on how we reap what we sow. Be weary of your actions and whom they may affect because everything in life has a price. The series contains valuable social commentary on the upper class abusing their power and how they are able to evade heinous crimes such as human humiliation and abuse, tying into the severity of school bullying within South Korea. Showcasing very gruesome and grotesque scenes which are not for the faint of heart.

The series' weakness lies within it's predictability as the viewer can already tell how this storyline is going to end. The theme feels familiar to other popular revenge stories such as 'Lady Vengeance' and the 'Kill Bill' duo-logy. But I believe the narrative is truly about the journey rather than the destination and this certainly has been a memorable experience as I unapologetically binge-watched the season in two days. I am looking forward to the release of Part 2 and the conclusion of this potently written drama.

The Glory,"One dimensional, comically evil, comically cringe.","Bad guys are bad, comically evil. No depth, no redeeming qualities. Bad to protagonist, bad to each other. I have more chemistry with a slice of pizza than the main antagonist with her dreams/motivations (her relationships with her husband and daughter).

Main character is ok. Comes off as dead inside, no anger or sadness or joy. Just dead. Not great for a revenge story, but some moments are saved by her veteran acting skills.

Main character's love interest is a 27yo, acting the role of a 35yo, but comes off as immature & shallow as an 18yo. He's a stereotypical teenage girl's crush: a doctor & a bad boy who gets into fights, empathetic & loved by his patients, from a good background & willing to kill for his love interest who doesn't reciprocate any kindness. King of simps. King of cringe.

Interesting plot. Terrible characters. Interesting quotes. Terrible dialog. Interesting story. Terrible execution.

One dimensional. Comically cringe."
The Glory,Just Another Uninspired K-Drama,"The idea seemed promising and the reviews positive. Now, I'm beginning to think the latter were either fake or from people with very low standards.

This show has nothing but clichés and an unrealistic script to offer. It's slow and filled with useless scenes and dialogs. Really, it's your typical K-Drama, shallow but shiny.

It does shine indeed but only in vanity. None of the characters have redeeming qualities. They're either murderers, would-be killers or violent criminals. All that, very casually!

Quite surprisingly, the episodes are long but nothing meaningful ever really happens and the plot never seems to progress. So, my advice: do not waste your time!"

The Glory,Really quite good,"Binge watched on a sleepless night and glad I did!

First off the bullying scenes are quite harrowing some of them bought me to tears There's an underlying message as in all Korean tv/movies about how class rules society shown as how a young Dong Eun has no one to turn to because of her lowly standing and her perpetrators are giving free rein due to their parents wealth and standing in society.

The tension build up and complexity of the characters makes you care what is going to happen something a lot of series forget to do these days.

The acting is superb especially by Song Hye Kyo who plays Dong Eun,she manages to play her anger frustration and sadness brilliantly.

But the real showstopper for me is the little girl who plays Ye Sol...she steals every scene she is in I could watch her all day!!!!!

Well worth watching and cannot wait for march and part 2."

The Glory,Fantastic Drama 10/10,"One should not watch this as a K-drama point of view, because this simply pass all K-drama standards and could be regarded as a high quality television series.

If I go on to describe the characters, it may give out spoilers, so I am just going to say that every single cast member brought their A-game when giving life to these characters. Of course, the great actress Song Hyekyo stands tall amongst all of them for her micro expressive, cold and calculating character. But, even the little kid was really doing a great job and we felt raw emotions from all of them.

Lee Dohyun got a bit sidetracked in the first few episodes, despite him being the male lead, but he is very prominent and integral during the second half. He was the heart and soul of the show where the energy is provided by Hyekyo. Their chemistry was very palpable as well. Overall doing a spectacular job as the cast.

The director and writer must get along very well as the drama flowed very smoothly in a good pacing, without any fillers nor unnecessary characters. Even the camera angles and editing brought the highest of emotions to us. The dialogues were not over the top nor cringey and felt authentic.

The drama ended in a highly satisfactory note as well with no lose ends and everything getting tied up really nicely and neatly that you as a watcher feel content after watching the drama.

Highly recommended."
The Glory,What an intense and brillant drama😱👍,"The Glory was simply awesome and some of the things still happens sadly in some places in the world.

Loving this revenge drama of a series.

What a story.

Very emotionel drama and had tears of my own. And what an end to the season.

The koreans have done it again with another gem of a series. They just keep doing the thing. They really know how to make intense stuff. I think I look more korean series then other.

Very easy decision for me giving it a 10 out of 10.

Beautifull young korean actresses with some great scenes.

8 episodes not too long and simply perfect😉👍

I would recommend this series highly👍👍 Its all worth it."
The Glory,Songhyekyo masterpiece in her 40's,"The Glory is a masterpiece. Best writer best Director best actress and casts.. everyone stand out and each role was justified. I love dong Eun character... also the OST are amazing and im so stuck listening to it over and over,, cant wait for season 2 .. congrats To the whole cast. Don't miss to watch this drama full of lessons. You will see Hye Kyo's best drama on her 40's .. she is known for classic and successful drama in her 20's and 30's and now this one The Glory. I love her chemistry with her co actors and even actress. I will watch this over and over again and will not get bored.. 10/10."
The Glory,This could have been great...,"...but the acting was ridiculous. Lots of overwrought women shrieking and overacting. The facial expressions on the main bully chick were farcical and her two girlfriends were caricatures at best. I lost count of the amount of times they called each other ""b*#*@"". So much slapping, hair-pulling and destruction of property.

Most of the cast were overacting like crazy and the main character had one expression. The best out of a very poor lot was the helper lady who was being beaten by her husband. It all got a bit wearing after a while.

It's a shame as the topic being dealt with is universal and, apparently, happening with increasing frequency."
The Glory,seriously intense WOW,"Very few KD am i happy when its over and mostly wishing that a few episodes before the ending but not this one, season 2 is actually better than the very enjoyable 1 and how many times is that the case. The LF put on a performance that is unmatched in KD and i hope the USA give her credit like Squid game got which isnt even in the league of this series. The older lady that was her partner in crime was also just unbelievable and she always be fantastic in everything i ve seen her in. Plenty of twist her that dont go too overboard in the belief aspect. It might be set up for a season 3 but probably not, id watch this actress in this role every damn day."
The Glory,Revenge is a dish best serve...,"Oops...Wrong show. But that's what this show is about. It's a feel good movie of sorts. A almost perfect plan helped by the egos and self serving needs of the..... villains

The technicals are flawless, cinematography, character performance, plot , direction. Except maybe the dialogue. Words just moves the plot, add sizzles to the emotions but no depth other than one offs. That's almost always the problem with this type of show. Revenge is revenge. It serves the underdog but not realistically. It's almost a fantasy.

Sixteen episode is a bit long, plus extraneous characters and prolong who done it. The love interests is fitting but coincidentally needed to be just as twisted? I don't know."
The Glory,Was so promising.,"I liked the first few episodes. The story, idea of where this is going to, is exciting. But then you get to see the ""villains"" of the story; these people can't act. When they are angry they can only scream and curse. They don't give any depth to their character by acting with real emotions. That makes their appearance cringe-inducing to watch. And that's a pity, because the main idea itself was promising.

The real reason why series like this fails, is because they try so hard to create a significant difference between the good and bad people. Look at real life; you can't always see the difference that clear."

The Glory,Fantastic!,"Watched both season 1 and season 2 and I must say I was pleasantly surprised how good this drama is, I didn't think it was going to be this good. The acting from all the cast were brilliant. Fantastic actors/actresses and a standing ovation to the writer(s), producers and the director for bringing all this together. Season 2 just came out yesterday and it's already at No. 3 on Netflix.

I heard some people complain that Son Hye-kyo's character was a little too old but hearing it from Son Hye-kyo herself, that was all intentional. Her character Dong-eun went through so much in her life that she would look visibly older than her old classmates. Having a hard life would age anyone faster, make sense. Anyway, fantastic drama and one of the best dramas of 2023. I fully recommend."
How to Change Your Mind,,
Going for Gold,Imitation is the sincerest form of ....,"Once upon time, when the earth was green, an obscure and unambitious little young adult romcom was produced in Canada. The name of the film was The Cutting Edge. To the great surprise of everyone both in front of, and behind, the camera, the film was magical, a genuine phenom, and became (and still is!) a cult classic. If you have not seen it, stop reading this and go find a copy. NOW.

(Yes, yes, I know, before the email starts, the official IMDb profile says that CE1 was a US production but if you read the fine print, you will see that all filming was done in and around Toronto. Which means that most of the production staff were Canadian. Which makes this a first-generation Canadian film. Understand this -- there is a reason that most first-gen Canadian films have never been seen or heard of again. To be able to say that CE1 actually became a classic is ... extraordinary.) OK, back to CE2, a direct to video production. The good news is the performance of Christy Carlson Romano. It is never less than good and often more than great. It literally sustains the weak script (in many places a copy of CE1) and forgettable performances from the rest of the cast. Not their fault though. Looks like it was produced on a shoestring.

I read the IMDb reviews which tout that this film is good enough to stand on its own. Ugh! Listen, if not for the success of CE1, which started the franchise, this production would never have happened. At the end of the day, THAT is the acid test."
Going for Gold,Disappointment...is it really?,Comentario no disponible
Going for Gold,A case of one sequel being too many,"I really wanted to like this movie. The original was so good. I saw this one on broadcast TV. It might have been TV editing that screwed it up but there are still too many flaws. It simply doesn't measure up to the original story. It lacks the spark and pizazz of the original. Contrary to what the previous critic said, if you are going to use the same title and the same character names in this sequel, you have to invite comparison. The movie just stumbled along right until the end. There was some very nice skating but even that was kind of pieced together. I felt that every time they changed angles they were simply cutting out another fall. (Sorry, just the way it looked to me). In the end I had to ask myself why I had wasted my time."
Going for Gold,Sequels are Always a Disappointment,"This movie tries too hard to capitalize on the original, yet it seems as though the producer/directors didn't really see it. The interplay between the leading characters seems contrived, not at all as thoroughly charged and enjoyably funny as that from Doug and Kate in the first movie. Where there are clear parallels between the two, they come off flat. Where it really suggests to me that the producers didn't even study the magic of the first movie, is the casting of the new Kate and Doug. Who saw any of Moira Kelly's charm and fire in Stepfanie Kramer's character. In a word, she was wimpish. And does anyone see Scott Thompson Baker getting on the ice with DB Sweeney. And together they were just blah. Sequels always pale in comparison to the original, but this film could have been cute with a better script, and the two new characters contrasted with more colorful versions of Kate and Doug. A big disappointment!!"
Going for Gold,"It may not be a ""gold medal"" film, but it is still quite enjoyable","Jackie Dorsey (Christy Carlson Romano) is the daughter of Olympic skaters Kate Mosley and Doug Dorsey (from the first Cutting Edge film). She has been a singles skater, and a fine one but, during a competition, she falls hard and breaks a leg. Her parents are very concerned but doctors say the leg will heal and Jackie is determined to skate again. However, the young, very lovely ice princess decides to become a pairs skater, thinking that she can rely on the support of a partner, should her leg give her trouble. While continuing the healing process on a California beach, Jackie meets Alex (Ross Thomas), a hotshot surfer and line skater. A romance begins but he doesn't know who she is and she doesn't know that he might already have a girlfriend. When these revelations come to light, Jackie heads back to Connecticut, in a huff. Nevertheless, Alex begins skating lessons in a quest to become Jackie's new partner. Amazingly, he is a natural and, although Jackie is very reluctant, at first, they become a winning duo. Yet, complications are still present, for Alex and Jackie run hot and cold, on and off the ice, and Alex's old girlfriend re-enters the picture right before the Olympics. How will this mixed-up twosome fare in the most important competition of their lives? This is a nice film for fans of the first movie and of romantic drama in general. In fact, it echoes the original flick on many occasion, from Jackie's prima donna attitude, like her mother, Kate's, to Alex's wandering eye for the female sex, just like Jackie's dad, Doug Dorsey. Then, too, if the two main actors, Romano and Thomas, are not quite on par with Moira Kelly and D.B. Sweeney, of the first film, they are attractive and talented in their own ways. Naturally, the scale of the movie is not as grand, either in costuming, sets, or production but it is certainly adequate. As for the skating scenes, they are very nice indeed. A number of real life skating stars, including Oksana Baiul, make cameos so, dear viewer, keep a watch out. There are, perhaps, some viewers who may object to the fast-and-loose morals of Alex, with good reason. Therefore, parents might want to watch and discuss the film with their children before a joint viewing. But, really, this is quite a nice movie for lovers of skating and/or romance. Although it may not be a ""gold medal"" flick, it is certainly able to happily entertain its target audience."
Going for Gold,Who was Kate?,"For what it was, it was OK...a lot like the original movie especially with the spoiled-ness and getting everything handed to her. The same on the flipping the skirt up. It did clear up the ending of the original when it was left unclear whether or not Kate and Doug medaled after their program. I did think perhaps the original Kate and Doug would have captured more attention and maybe made the ratings a little better. Little disappointed on the new Christy Carlson-R...hard to see her go from a sweet innocent girl to a girl drinking and swearing. But who was Luanne in the movie? I had seen Christine Larkin in ""Step By Step"" but didn't recognize her in this movie. And who played Kate? I didn't see her character listed in the cast credits...maybe someone can shed some light on this."
Going for Gold,Solid MFTV viewing.,"A young ice skater injures herself and has to team up with a roguish hunk to compete at the Olympics.

Now this is never going to win any awards for originality but I think everyone understands that when they commit to watching it.

All the elements ares there, comedy, romance, betrayal, redemption, etc. etc.

I think Christy Romano is a beautiful and expressive actress and she seems very at home here as does Ross Thomas. The two make a cute couple and there are some great scenes of them bickering on and off the ice.

The problems with this film are really endemic of the format. I had to take three runs at this film as the opening scene is so cheap it put me off. The limitation in the budget shows through in places, especially with the crowd scenes at the competitions.

There are a few seconds of unnecessary CGI that are just plain bad, a step ladder and a watering can would have done a much better job.

The victory move is quite laughable but kind of in keeping with the film.

A great Sunday afternoon watch."
Going for Gold,This was a disappointment!,"This movie was truly a disappointment. I absolutely loved the first one, and would definitely give it 10 stars! When I heard that there was a second one, I was really happy, and thought that I might enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed the first one. Well, I definitely did not!! Maybe if you just decided to watch this one and not the first one, you might like it, but to have watched the first one, and then this one, this should be a disappointment! First off they basically just copy lines and scenes from the first one, which makes it even worse, because the scenes aren't good in this movie. I have many other reasons, but to make it easier, it just wasn't good!! I mean I'm a girl who watches a lot of chick flicks, even bad ones and actually enjoy some of them! This one was horrible; so please, if your interested in this type of movie watch the first one, it is way better, funnier, and I promise you that you will enjoy it a lot more than you would enjoy this one!"
Going for Gold,It stands on its own merits,"The movie is an updated retelling of The Cutting Edge. This time showcasing the daughter of Kate Mosley and Doug Dorsey named Jackie. Forget about the original as you sit down to watch this movie. This is a stand alone movie with its own storyline that does not keep the daughter in the shadow of her own parents. She makes her own success and failures. She is the perfect blend of her parents best and worst attitudes.

It shows the struggle entailed when you need to get back on your feet in a totally different world than what you are used to. It's always nice to have a companion when going down a new road. Specially when you are both new to that world (pair skating) and have to learn to become one. It also helps when Jackie's companion (Alex) turns out to be the best friend and enemy she can have as he mirrors her own strengths and weaknesses. Alex forces Jackie to realize that she can't do everything alone and yeah, it's okay to show your emotions. Without Alex, Jackie had all but forgotten that ""It's not worth winning if you don't fight for it.""

It is nice to see the characters as less rigid than their original counterparts. With the love story taking place both on and off the ice. It shows that athletes are human as well and enjoy the occasional time off to celebrate and just kick back and relax. With Jackie's parents being supportive all the way and allowing her room to make mistakes and correct them with their love, support and guidance.

The movie is a good companion piece to The Cutting Edge. It caters to a whole new generation of fans and is destined to become a classic on its own eventually. A+++ for good clean fun."
Going for Gold,Just plain awful !,Comentario no disponible
Going for Gold,credits,I thought the film was very good and it was great to observe the interaction with the skaters and the parents. It was similar to the first film; however had enough of it's own story to keep one's interest. I was wondering why Mrs. Dorsey is not listed in your credits. I felt that Stepfanie Kramer did an outstanding job as the mother and she even looks enough like Christy to convince the viewer they are related. I would hope that she could be added to your page along with her other performances on TV such as her role in Hunter and many other made for TV movies. The skating feats are amazing and the dancing is well choreographed. I would watch this film again and may consider purchasing it with the first sequel for my personal library.
Going for Gold,I am not a 14 year old girl,"But I wound up watching this movie on a Sunday afternoon and I enjoyed it. Admittedly, I ingested six Shiner Bock's before viewing and a couple while watching it. Still, I stand by my positive review. I'm not going to try to defend the film in any intellectual way. It's no Kurosawa or Truffaut piece of work. I can only defend it in the same way I would a Journey song: Yes, it's corny, but I am drunk so screw you. Is that too confrontational? I'm sorry, I'm drunk. Whoops, I just spilled my beer. Party foul. At this point I'd go into an irrational diatribe about the Mariner's inept hitting at too loud a volume. Where was I? Oh, yeah. I have to say, the criticism of Christy Carlson Romano acting seems out of place. She's given a character that has no internal logic by the writers and does the best that could be done with it. Her scene at the door where she confesses her love for her partner is particularly good, to my senses. Any way, I feel kind of unmasculine now so I'm going to go watch Commando for the seven hundredth time. 6 stars."
Going for Gold,Do not watch this movie if you treasure your sanity.,"I cannot express in words how awful this movie is. Maybe if you gouge your eyes out, graciously overlook the ridiculously bad writing and acting, and try not to compare it with the infinitely better original you might walk away only moderately traumatized. Personally, I feel like I need a shower after seeing it. This sequel has all the silliness of the The Cutting Edge with none of the charm (not to mention none of the original cast). If I could give it a negative rating I would gladly do so; it's an unnecessary film that is so bad it almost goes so far as to ruin the original. I would rather see Kate and Doug get hit by a zamboni than believe that their union spawned this 'Jackie' creature. Horrible. Props to D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly for skating away from a clear disaster."
Going for Gold,Uugghh!,"The featured comment that gives an ""A+++ for good clean fun"" to this film is written like a studio authored press blurb. I'm a little suspicious of the author as I just saw the DVD and I can say that this film competes with ""Highlander II: The Quickening"" as the worst sequel ever. I was a fan of Christy Romano until this movie. Mostly because she is hot, but also because she acts with so much energy. She had the acting breadth of a soap actress in this film. She projected three emotions; bemused, upset and completely blank, and used them over and over again, sometimes inappropriately. That would be fine for a half an hour TV show, but it was a snore here. It was like she took the Ren Stevens character from ""Even Stevens"", renamed her Jackie and threw her into this film. Ross Thomas did a good job of playing a ""dude"" character, but every non-skating scene between the two was dragged down by Ms. Romano's Jackie. As to the film itself, it played like an episode of ""Baywatch"" complete with montages of unrelated people and things used to transition to the next scene and pop songs in the background that drown out the actors dialog. It's ""Baywatch"" on ice. What a shame."
Going for Gold,"Not bad, could have been better",Comentario no disponible
Going for Gold,Christy Carlson Romano was hideous,"Here's the thing ... when you put a female in a leading role, you have to give the audience something worth seeing. First of all, Romano can't act -- even on the Disney Channel's Even Steven's, she's horrible. At least on Disney Channel, most of the audience is younger, and they don't seem to notice her terrible acting. But, in a movie... especially against someone as cute, sexy, and sassy as Ross Thomas... you have to provide a good leading lady. Whoever did the casting for this movie should be fired. And the story line... not great. I could have lived with it, but it seemed to try too hard to put in similarities from the first movie. Maybe with a better female in the lead, it could've been pulled off... but I doubt it. If there is a Cutting Edge III, keep Thomas, ditch Romano and hire a new writer."
Going for Gold,Attn. this is a remake not a sequel.,"The original Cutting Edge got great word of mouth and I know both men and women that really enjoyed that movie. Fast forward to the remake, which this is. Simply a direct to video remake. Some minor changes: 1)the skaters are now coached by her parents (different actors) not the Russian trainer 2)he now has the girlfriend/fiancé instead of her 3)She is now recovering from an injury not him 4)he comes from extreme in-line skating now rather then hockey. Thats about the only differences. If you saw the original it plays out almost fight for fight, right down to the announcers of their Olympic performance commenting how they were technically perfect but skating without any passion, just like in the first. About a minute before that I jokingly made that same comment to my girlfriend not thinking that they would actually use it again in this version. The movie was entertaining, but I've never seen a ""sequel"" follow the original formula quite so closely. If you've seen the original pass on this, its OK, but you've seen it done better before."

Going for Gold,previous reviewer,"admitted i've only seen the trailer, but the other reviewer seems .... how can i put it.....ridiculous. I know that trailers can capture the ""only"" decent parts of a movie. Christy does not look like that person says and the movie trailer seems to set it up to be more of a extreme sports slanted movie. Besides if you hated the first Cutting Edge then why would you bother with this one? It could be that this movie isn't even going after someone like you anyway. My guess is that it sticks to what is set up in the trailer and there will be plenty of people go and see it. it may not be a blockbuster, but what movies are these days except ""Narnia"" and other ""epics""."
Going for Gold,Not even an entertaining sort of bad film,"The original Cutting Edge wasn't classic cinema by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a fun little movie in its own way. This sequel has all of the bad qualities of the original film, and absolutely none of the good ones. The actors barely ""act"", the skating is ridiculous (and haven't they figured out yet that competitions aren't done under spotlights, pairs don't skate to vocal music, and the music doesn't start until the skaters are out in the middle of the ice?), and the dialog is straight out of a high-schooler's fanfic.

The overbearing use of soundtrack music is another problem with the film; it's used to tell you exactly what the characters are thinking, almost constantly. It rarely stops. And the thing is, they have to do this because the acting is so poor that the music is really the only way to get the emotions across. Music in movies can be great, but in this one it really seemed overdone and the lyrics far too literally connected to the plot. (It's not an opera, you know...)

Currently there are a bunch of 10 ratings for this film; they have got to be shill votes, because this is just not a good movie in any sense. Also, the earlier poster who claimed that the original Cutting Edge was actually from 1980... um, no. You are probably thinking of Ice Castles (1978) -- and if you are looking for an ice skating-themed romance, try that movie instead. It's dated, but far, far better than this low-budget travesty."
Going for Gold,I liked it...,"I didn't find this movie all that bad, especially for one that didn't appear in theaters. I saw it on TV and for a ""made-for-TV"" movie I liked it. The acting wasn't awesome or anything but Christy Carlson Ramano and Ross Thomas made the roles believable. At the end of the movie I couldn't help but smiling, I thought it was an adorable and perfect ending. I thought the overall plot line was pretty good as well. I really bought right into the whole movie, but maybe that's because I'm some teenage girl who likes sappy love stories and figure skating. Anyways, overall I liked the movie and would recommend it, more for young teen girls who like this kind of genre."
Going for Gold,Overly cheesy but quite cute really,"Okay, so it's not the best film I've ever seen, but if you like cheesy girly romcoms then it's not so bad. It made me laugh quite a few times and the figure skating is good. The film isn't as good as The Cutting Edge and it's a shame that they don't have any of the same actors, but it's alright as far as sequels go. It's a bit too much like the first one in that the heroine is a work-obsessed over-motivated meanie, and the guy starts off not being able to figure skate at all, but all the same I thought it was quite entertaining =P I'd give it a seven out of ten for all its cuteness. Plus points: Jackie's actress is good in a scene near the end when she cries a lot, the acting is actually reasonably convincing and she certainly cries enough real tears."
Going for Gold,It wasn't horrible it wasn't fantastic,"On its merits alone it would have been a fine Saturday afternoon flick. It was rather predictable in storyline but anyone starting that could figure that out 2 minutes in.

Where it falls shortest is in the rehashing of the toe-pick joke from the first movie, I was only hoping they would hint at it until she finally said it. The other part was the bad 80s music which is OK if you're watching a brat pack spin off flick from pre 1992, in 2006 it just feels like the director was still in torn jeans and a Def Leppard shirt.

If you're just looking for something easy going, or a movie to watch while recovering from major head surgery then you're set. I know it sounds mean, but I just wish these people would give a damn when they make a film to have it look better than a high school production of Grease."

The Piano Forest,"Lots of nice classical music, uninspired animation","I'm a huge classical music fan. I play the piano a lot and I love doing so which is why I thought this series will be perfect for me, but I was sadly mistaken.

First of all, I would give the first season 8/10 The good: Fast paced storytelling, heartwarming storys and a likeable protagonist and antagonist (if you can even call him that). Beautiful music and it makes one want to play the piano.

The bad: You can't really enjoy a piece of music since it will be cut of at any second. On the other hand, sometimes they go on for a minute even though you've heard it a lot already just to ""show the reactions"". This is a big point, in a Manga you can write how it makes people feel but in animation, you should be able to feel that as well. which of course is very difficult, and they didn't really succeed.

The cringe-worthy: The animation. It's a 2D animation with 3D when they play the piano. The movement of the hands is very pleasant and rarely seen in animation, but when the whole body is shown, it looks creepy and unpleasant. But after a season, I got used to it.

Season 2: This season discarded almost everything good about the first and tried to better the cringe-worthiness by removing the 3D. But, they made it worse. Now there are juist still shots shown of them playing the piano. Sometimes they are clearly playing with both hands and the still shows them with one hand in the air.

The fast paced story comes to a halt because the entire season is just one big competition and the animation gets so lazy they use still shots about 50% of the time. Did the budget run out? What happend?

The good: The protagonist is still likeable and the music still good (except that it's now exclusively Chopin, which get's a bit boring after a few hours)

4/10

Overall 6/10 First season is recommendable, the second season not so much."
The Piano Forest,"It's REALLY good, but it definitely has is cons. MAJOR ones.","Tbh I wasn't expecting crazy animation but man this was on PowerPoint levels. It's such a good story and amazing music, it just feels so wrong. It's like the whole budget went to animating his hair as if a fan were in front of him. I knew it wasn't going to be like YLIA, but I expected at least a little arm movement while he was playing. It's such a shame.

Other than that I highly recommend it. I sat through both seasons. Binged it even. It's a captivating story. Moved me to tears a couple of times. You know, sometimes there doesn't need to be mappa, ufotable, or even kyoto animation levels. But it does help."
The Piano Forest,Good story with a poor animation,"Me and my wife couldnt stop watching it until the final episode. It is a beautiful and simple story enriched by the excellent soundtrack you would expect when exploring such a theme - the main character has a sad familiar background but mastered compositions from Chopin in his magic piano.

But the animation here is so poor, there is so many frozen images that I feel embarassed to recommend it to someone else who enjoys animation-style series. It looks like a perfect script lost for the low budged project. I hope some other team work in this script in the future with the proper technical resources it needs, specially because one of hardest things to do in animation is to synchronize and put weight in movements of someone playing an instrument."
The Piano Forest,"Charming story, plenty of Chopin","I loved Season 1 and binge-watched Season 2 of this charming series. It shows Kai growing from poor waif into an accomplished pianist with great generosity of spirit. His teacher Ajino and rival Shuhei grow with him as childhood resistance and rivalry mature into supportive friendship. Meanwhile, much great piano artistry is featured as nearly the entire second season takes place at the Chopin competition in Poland. Other characters at the competition are well-developed and authentic with interesting side-stories. I wept with its poignancy several times. Don't miss it!"
The Piano Forest,A Lovely and Musical Coming-of-age Story,"Forest of Piano or Piano no Mori is based on a 2007 animation film also called Piano no Mori. I haven't watched the film but, based on the images I saw, I can tell the first season of the anime covers the story in the movie and the second season expands it. In the first part we watch Kai Ichinose difficult childhood, his connection with the piano in the forest and the beginning of his relashionship with Shuhei Amamiya. It's a simple yet captivating coming-of-age story, with a nice character development and a good narrative. Kai is very likeable and I couldn't help but be curious to know what was going to happen in his life, so I went straight to season 2. There are some differences regarding the two parts. The second has much more music and more characters. If you like piano and erudite music, then you are gonna enjoy this part a lot. It's delightful to watch and, essentialy, to hear the pianists through the 12 episodes of the season, the same amount of season 1. I can't say much about the second phase, cause it would be a spoiler so I'll just say it focuses on a very famous pianist from the romantic era and it's lovely to see the amount of love people from the country where he was born still gives him, through events. Like I said before, there are more characters in this season, what adds a lot to the narrative, that becomes more complex, with more conflicts. There is just one negative thing I gotta highlight in this review: the animation. The drawing is beautiful, but it lacks in motion. In the first season the animators used techniques to give motion to the characters while playing the piano, so it's delightful to watch and hear the piano. But, regarding season 2, there is almost no movement at all, therefore, it relies totally in the beautiful soundtrack. Like I said in the trivia, professional pianists were hired to play for the studio. I don't know so much about music yet I could totally notice the difference in the way each character plays the piano. It's a masterful job. That's why it's crucial to like erudite music to watch this anime, because it's what stands out in it. I loved the music, the landscapes and the energy about the city so much that it became a dream of mine to go there someday and pay homage to the brilliant composer the anime honors."
The Piano Forest,"Amazing, brilliant!!","I absolutely loved this series. I must admit that the second series drags a bit with the lead up to the finale, but my oh my does it still deliver. I was hooked from episode one and I could not wait to watch all the episodes. Absolutely fantastic series, with the drama of friendship and love, and the descriptions of the piano which made you feel as if you were in the place Kai and the others were taking you to. Cannot emphasis enough how great this series is."
The Piano Forest,"Charming, Brilliant!!!","This is the best series I have ever watched. It is not just about classical music, it teaches you many life lessons. They thing is that you need a warm, soft, light soul to go beyond what your eyes see and what your ears listen. Love it!!!"
The Piano Forest,Very moving!,I not only loved this for the Classical Piano but also how it draws you into the minds of both pianist and audience. Maybe piano competitions and concerts aren't your thing but that's ok because I loved it. I was hoping for a season 3 but no such luck.
The Piano Forest,Starts of well but drags by the end of it.,"The anime is based on a manga focused on a boy named Kai who wants to play the Piano. Having already read the manga and enjoying it quite a bit I was excited to see an anime being released. The coming of age plot although not original or perfect kept me hooked at the start.

I am not much into music and have no idea of Piano or classical music. Initially, I was enjoying a few of the scores, but the repetition of the same does get tiring, the same were easier to browse over in manga format. Others may find listening to music as the highlight but that was not the case for me. The animation itself was good overall but the close up of the characters while they play the Piano is terrible, the art shifts from 2D to 3D, from old style color painting to clunky 3d characters, this was not needed and bought down the overall watch experience for me.

Season One (7/10) The first season of twelve episodes seems more fun and better paced with the background development of the main character.

Season Two (4/10) The second season seems to be a big drag, the focus on other characters and their life only prolonged the already dull storytelling, the repetition of the same music over and over again in a competition didn't help the matter much. Did love the ending but I do feel the anime should have been shortened instead of staying true to the manga."
The Piano Forest,One of it's kind,"A very beautiful story in only 24 ep. A treat for anime watches little mature ones. The anime is good but not like typical animes. Btw anime is not only for animation. The story is really good it really covers all the aspects a good and proper anime should have it's a treat for ears the music and more Chopin. The main thing is it's very realistic feelings are properly shown and the relationship of a teacher and pupil, the relationship of a mother and son and friends really heart warming I was totally fallen for it. At the end it's a complete masterpiece anime of its own kind a character driven anime rather than plot driven. Not a typical shonen of love or SOL."

The Piano Forest,Yes.,"Don't come here for the animation, come here for the music, feelings, and stories that will gently swirl you in a pool of cold and warm waters.

Also I'd suggest to watch the movie even though first 4-5 episodes of the series are copy paste from the movie, but rushed through. I watched the movie and then straight up went for the series. Movie is even better once you add the points for animation. But yeah the series are still a great piece, I went here for the feels and I got even more than I asked for. Very nice music too, stories and inspiration is heartfelt."
The Piano Forest,Enthralling animated series,"This animation about a feisty boy, Kai Ichinose, who finds an abandoned piano in a forest and learns to play it by himself, is so addictive I watched the whole 2 seasons, of 12 episodes each, in one sitting.

He rescues a classmate Shuhei Amamiya from bullies and, after finding out Shuhei wants to be a pianist, shows his new friend his piano in the forest. By some magic, the piano only responds to his touch. Shuhei is startled by Kai's playing and starts to harbor a complex emotion of envy and admiration for Kai, an emotion that eventually turns into an obsession to prove his superiority in piano playing.

Kai's teacher, Sosuke Ajino, a once-renowned pianist who got incapacitated after an accident, finds out about Kai's piano and volunteers to train the poor but extremely talented boy who, being the son of a prostitute and raised in a red-light district, would have little chance to better himself.

Season 2 is mostly about the International Chopin Piano Competition that Kai and Shuhei participate in. Side stories about the participants and Ajino add to the delightfulness of the series. The competition is fierce, raising my respect for pianists through the roof for having not only enormous talent but also incredible memory and nerves of steel. The commentaries from spectators add to the excitement about the events. But most of all, the music is exquisite, made more so by the pianists' affinity with it."
The Piano Forest,"An okay story, but really poorly animated","I watched Forest of Piano on Netflix soon after finishing Your Lie in April, which is another anime series with a focus on a teenage pianist. I must say these two animes are beyond compare, and that's not in favor of this one. So if you intend to watch both, I strongly suggest to watch Forest of Piano first and Your Lie in April second. Or, if you want to watch (or have already watched) the better one first, at least do yourself a favor and have a decent break between the two.

The story told in this anime is warm and positive, but it becomes quite dull by the second season, the entirety of which focuses on a single piano competition. Yes, there are occasional minor plot twists, but they're burried between characters just living their daily lives and enjoying (or not so much) each other's piano skills. By the time season 1 ended, I was already watching this series not because I liked it, but just because I wanted to clear my head in the evening and get to the eventual happy ending.

But what's probably worst in this series is the animation quality, especially in season 2. One word: cheap. Much of the time Forest of Piano looked almost like a screensaver: static images being panned around your TV, with a simplistic snow-like effect to hide the total lack of real animation. Actual character movement was very scarce. Even in peak moments, visual aesthetic hardly reached what you'd typically see in other animes. Did they accidentally miss a digit or two when allocating the budget for animation, or something?"

The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Not bad at all.,"I love animations, though I wasn't particularly keen on the movie this was inspired by. It's just too bizarre to think of babies this way... Of course its public is children who like to laugh at simple things, but that's the point in which watching this series as an young adult is worth the while. In my opinion, it's nice to see that a show with good morals is being produced in this hectic society. The importance of family, relying on others for support, believing in what you do, and so on, are things that I feel are not anymore in the goals our children are growing up to look up to. I hope it gets renewed!"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,A Good Show,"It was a good, well directed TV show. Every child has its own characteristics. I liked Staci acting, her attitude while working in team. It was like little man in her. This show has lesson for everyone like working in team and managing team. Family and love is the core of this show."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,This series for Family 😃,"A series with family moral around here. Yeah, still need PG for watching this, but is okay. 😃"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Great show for all ages,My kids love the show and the cute story lines. Some great hidden adult humor. I'm even known to have it running when the kids aren't around. Good for all ages.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Gives bad messages to kids,"This show is aimed at young kids, but much of the humor involves being rude or mean to others, which is not something that kids can properly understand until they reach an older age. If kids begin mimicking things they see on the show, then this show is conveying a very poor message to its target audience."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,A Very Clever Show,"I noticed people reviewed this show as a 'bad message' and having 'anger and hatred' when in fact it's just a clever show written about a baby's business which is to keep babies the most adorable creature in the world.

It's actually a great message because it is true to life if anybody here actually works for a successful company. And it isn't angry or hateful at all. I find this show to be smart and well done.

If you have a personality at all you'll love this show."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,STAY CLEAR OF THIS CRINGE FEST,"This series is bad, even by a kids show standards. The voice acting is over the top and just cringey. The characters are unrealistic and in no way the way they were in the first movie. It's as if everyone got hyped up on suger for this series. Jp karliak Does an ok job as Boss Baby, but is in no way as good as Alec Baldwin. This show threw everything good from the movie out, and replaced it with suger hyped acting, storylines, and characters. It's best just to stay away from this cringe fest."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Love it!,"I love this show so much. It's a kid's show but adults can really enjoy it if they want to. The jokes are smart, witty and funny. 100% recommend it"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Diabolical,"Today I watched an episode of this because I thought it would be more decent and less stupid than the movie. But unfortunately I was so damn wrong! This show is worse than the movie! WHO ON EARTH THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE THIS CRAP?!

The animation and the voice acting is fine, but seriously though the humor mostly consists of forced offensive, toilet, nasty and insulting jokes! I wonder, did they let a five year old write the episodes for this?

Don't waste your time on this rubbish. The animation and the voice acting are the only good two things about this show."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"A well-made and a very deep tv show , hands for NETFLIX !!!","The Movie is nothing standing to the TV-SHOW , it looks kinda of a kid show , but nah it has a serious level of hidden-sarcasm and dark comedy, just WATCH it and have a nice day !"
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,"Weird, and painful to watch.","I watch a lot of kid's TV shows with my kid, he's 4. This show is one of the worst I've seen in a while, and on top of it there's some kind of weird conservative agenda behind it."

The Boss Baby: Back in Business,I love it,This is actually really entertaining and it's unbelievably funny
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Bot appropriate for children,There is so much hidden sarcasm and inappropriate comedy. Not appropriate for children under 10 if I had to choose. It seems that there is a huge hidden agenda in this series!
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Much better than the movie,"Despite my 4 year old son wanting to watch the movie over and over, I was honestly a bit disappointed ... that is until I watched the series on Netflix. When I sat down to watch this with my son, I was surprised to find myself laughing along with him. It's true that the humor is witty and sarcastic and occasionally it's even inappropriate for small children. However, I would still recommend this show over Rugrats or Spongebob."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,This show sucks.,"The show sucks. It has terrible CGI animation, pointless plots, and terrible acting. Staci had the worse acting out of all the characters. There's also these continuity errors, like the fact that Boss Baby still works at Baby Corp, even though he abandoned his job and went to live with the Templetons. Also, the mom and dad don't call him by his given name ""Theodore Lindsey Templeton"". There's also toilet humor, which makes the show even worse. And the 2D animation is also terrible as well.

In conclusion, this is the WORST SHOW Dreamworks has EVER made."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Total garbage with a handful of perks,"This show is terrible. There's no other way to put it. Thank the lord almighty there were only 13 episodes, because I couldn't take any more. This series is basically symbolic of everything Netflix has come to.

The main plot line is similar to the plot of the original Boss baby, which was also pretty bad, except instead of using puppies, this show teaches all children to hate cats. What's wrong with cats, other than the fact that they are infinitely cuter than babies will ever be?

The overall stupidity of this show is appalling to me, and I can't even fathom why the creators would hate cats so much. However, there were a handful of enjoyable parts.

The highlight of the show was the rap into, which was stupid to the point of hilarity. In general, when the 'protagonists' aren't bashing cats in some way, it was actually a little funny, with some more mature humor thrown in every now and then, such as when two people get attacked by a killer baby swing, or when the nameless boss baby states ""This is like negotiating with North Korea""

In general, though, I wouldn't recommend this to anybody who at all values their sanity. The show even states that the entire premise is stupid, when it is explained that knowing about 'baby-corp' completely broke the minds of adults. This is just terrible as a whole."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Great show,"The Boss Baby: Back in Business is a show about the dynamic of the boss baby's work life and family life. The character development is phenomenal, and this movie is a great watch for anyone interested."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Embarrasing,"This series was a mediocre, well, nearly a disaster. The series have a very low rated there, following with the movie, this series have more s*its to talk about. It is unlike the worst that screamed on Netflix, I have a 3 yrs old but he didn't like that show just because it's worse than other children show he'd watched when it filled up with F- rated circumstances here, with boring, slappy things, with that baby faced in the series shows up with anger and hatred. I think Netflix should stop it. It's terrible."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Boss Baby is not just for Kids but Adults,Boss Baby is a great kids to adult cartoon that I personally love! It is very inventive and love how they take adult problems and translate it into an innocent (and sometimes teen) reality.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Total Garbage,I can't say enough about how horrible this show is.
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Babies vs. Kittens,"The Boss Baby movie was good, funny, but was inconsistent with its plot with information given that was contradictory to what was said earlier in the movie. But this television series, The Boss Baby: Back in Business, was much better, funnier and I can't think of any plotholes throughout the whole series. The series consists of 13 episodes on Netflix. Most episodes of the show revolve around the Boss Baby, Tim, and the crew (Staci, Jimbo, and the triplets) making sure people love babies. Boss can look at his little heart meter to see the level of people around town to see how many people are loving babies. There is an over-arching plot of this series where a man by the name of Bootsy Calico who plays the villain uses kittens to take over the town, so the babies must defend their city. The voice actors sound practically the same even though they aren't. My favorite characters are Staci and Boss. I'd love for there to be another season of this show."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Snoozer Boss,"It was really dreadfully boring.

1 episode was enough to determine that this show was not good. That's all it took.

It's too fast-paced and uninteresting. The characters were weak links."
The Boss Baby: Back in Business,Well-made and entertaining show,"This is an example of how to do family entertainment correctly. There is nothing outright offensive, meaning it is suitable for all ages. It has jokes that all ages can enjoy, meaning the entire family can watch without anyone becoming bored. There is an overall plot-line throughout the series, however individual episodes also have well-defined plots motivated by a meaningful message. The voice acting is good, and the animation is charming and of a consistently good standard. On top of this, it also hints at more adult topics without actually touching on them, blurring the difficult line between challenging children with more adult content or sheltering them. This is definitely a win for Dreamworks Animation!"

Bo on the Go!,"Vapid, boring, annoying","The first and most important thing to know about this show is that each and every episode is exactly the same. The formula they use is not just loosely repetitive; it is almost exactly the same each episode with only the most minor of changes.

It starts with a problem. Then they have to summon ""wizard"" (requiring some stupid physical activity) to tell them what they must do to solve the problem. He ALWAYS tells them they must enter the chamber of doors.

So to get the chamber of doors to appear, more physical activity is required. Bo is like this little energy vampire that leeches off the viewer... it's actually quite creepy.

They have to open the first two doors for no discernible reason other than the door that solves the problem is always the third door, so I suppose two diversions are always required.

Throughout all of this are trite rhymes, horrible and annoying voice acting, and ridiculous ""solutions"" to problems.

When I say horrible and annoying voice acting, I mean it.

Bo's voice is one of the most annoying I have ever heard. This is especially when she says things like:

""As high as you CAAAAN, reach out your HAAANDS""... the inflection on those words is annoying as can be.

Then there's the odd way she says ""Will ya help me?""

And when she says ""when you move with me you give me energy"", she pronounces ""energy"" like ""En-er-chi"" (like Chi, that mystic energy of eastern religions)

And the dinosaur, oh my god that dinosaur... whoever voiced him has the worst voice ever. It's raspy, too loud, and monosyllabic.

""A DOOR!"" ""ANIMOVES!"" ""BO ZONE!!!""

He's always YELLING his words.

It's not shocking why this show only had one season.

The ONLY redeeming value of this show is that it attempts to get kids to move and exercise."
Bo on the Go!,"Formulaic, Cheesy, and Unoriginal","""Bo On the Go"" is one of the worst television shows ever. It follows one basic formula that never changes. While a show like ""Phineas and Ferb"" follows a consistent formula, it frequently changes up the premise, has a fun concept, and most importantly, has good writing. ""Bo On the Go"" has none of these qualities. It's premise is as child-safe and inoffensive as sleeping, except without the enjoyable qualities. The show tries to encourage exercising by comparing exercises to animal movements. But aside from that, ""Bo On the Go"" has no creative ideas in animation, story, or writing."
Bo on the Go!,Terrible graphics,"The graphics are terrible! They look like something out of a PS2 or Wii game! Those system's graphics aren't bad by all means, it's just, that's what this show looks like"
Bo on the Go!,Good show for its intended audience.,"I think this show is intended for VERY young children, and I have enjoyed watching my grandchildren (1 and 2 years old) summoning the wizard, stretching for the keys, and doing ""animoves"". It's fun and active and helps teach pattern recognition. Yes, of course, we know we we have to reach for the key EVERY time, but that's really the point here.

The only thing we joke about is that Bo is a bit ego-centric. Especially when she says something is ""Bo-Brilliant"". :)

If you are looking for a good story-line and strong character development, then, no, this isn't the show you are looking for. If you are looking for a good, simple, active show for toddlers, ""Bo on the GO!"" fills the bill nicely."
Bo on the Go!,You Make My Powerband Glow!,"Both of my children, ages 1 & 3, love this show. It teaches kids to be active and gets them moving. The catch phrases and storyline are repetitive but as parents we should all recognize the value of that for children. They learn through repetition and reward, and this show provides both. The colors in the show are bright, and the voices are bearable(I saw a review that was pretty harsh about the annoying voices and I disagree entirely. This is no Caillou!). The characters are pretty cute and my son has had an interest in this show for nearly two years, so I can tell you first-hand that this show hasn't lost its appeal."
Bo on the Go!,Toddler loves!,My toddler LOVES this show. Although the graphics as stated in the other review are not great..... the entire concept is amazing. My toddler gets to watch cartoons so she's happy and I'm happy because she gets up and goes with bo! Win win!
Bo on the Go!,Great for kids,"My 2 year old toddler watch this a 1000 times a day and my 6 month old infant love this show, they prefer to watch this over any other kids cartoon. It would be cool if they come out with toys !!"

The Discovery,Underrated flick that deserves a viewing,"I wasn't sure about seeing this film because of the rating, but the concept was interesting and being a fan of Rooney Mara's work I decided to give it a shot. And I am glad I did.

The opening scene is very well done because it grabs your attention from the first second. But what comes after is what bothered most of the viewers who felt disappointed - the personal story line between Jason Siegel's and Rooney Mara's characters becoming the center of attention instead of the concept of an afterlife and how it works.

Personally, while watching the movie, I did feel a little bit deceived, because ""the discovery"" took a back seat, BUT after finishing the movie it all made sense. I think the film was very well structured and managed to get across it's idea and explanation of how afterlife works very well to the audience, without having to talk about it and explain it in every scene as if the viewers are little children. I do not agree with some statements that the concept of ""the discovery"" was not well done, finished or explained well. Last 10 min. do contain a lot of information and the viewer should pay attention.

The acting was very good, however overall I must agree that it is not the most exciting film. What I mean is that it won't be in your ""most memorable or favorite""movie list. It's a good watch on lazy night though. Give it a go."
The Discovery,"Interesting premise and good acting, then kind of falls apart",Comentario no disponible
The Discovery,A Great Idea That Just Never Comes Together,"There are a number of good things that can be said about Netflix's ""The Discovery"": It is good to see Netflix tackling big-budget, dramatic/sci-fi fare. It's encouraging that actors with the reputation such as Robert Redford has are now willing to work with the premiere streaming service. Plus, ""The Discovery"" actually has a germ of a really great idea at its core. Unfortunately, however, the film never really comes together like it should, essentially wasting that inventive idea with clunky acting and even worse pacing.

For a basic plot summary, ""The Discovery"" takes place in a future where noted scientist Thomas (Redford) has definitively proved the existence of an afterlife. The problem? Now people are committing suicide by the millions knowing that ""something else"" is beyond this mortal coil. The next logical step for Thomas, then? Discovering exactly what this afterlife consists of. This is where his son Will (Jason Segel) comes into the picture, visiting the scientist for the first time since a major falling-out to try and convince him to scrap the entire project. Along the way, younger son Toby (Jesse Plemons) chooses sides, while Will finds a mysterious woman (played by Rooney Mara) who has her own relationship with the ""discovery"".

Like I said, the concept behind this film is fascinating: What would happen if the afterlife were proved scientifically? Also, and I won't give away spoilers here, but even the research into what that afterlife consists of is fascinating in what it entails.

Unfortunately, though, the film is only a middling effort because of two glaring missteps that drag down the whole production:

1. The romance angle between Will & Isla. If you've seen the film ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", that one nails this dynamic much better. In ""Discovery"", however, there is just no reason to believe that these two will fall in love, much less how that angle comes to dominant much of the film's runtime.

2. Perhaps better acting would have saved that romance angle, but alas it wasn't to be found here. Mara is much too bland as Isla, while Segel is terribly miscast as the lead. More than blank, brooding stares were needed for the role, but that is all Segel seems to be able to provide here. Redford is his usually solid self, and Plemmons steals the show from time to time, but other than that none of the other acting performances are above average (with some being quite below that line).

So, while ""The Discovery"" is a film that I really want to like more than 5-stars out of 10, the end product just isn't worthy of anything more. Had the sci-fi aspect been the focus throughout, I think that would have improved things considerably. A better, less confusing ending would have helped as well. As it stands, though, ""Discovery"" comes off as a very second-rate ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" clone. Netflix may be taking strides in the right direction when it comes to original feature films, but there is still a ways to go to compete with the big studios."
The Discovery,Teases With An Interesting Idea But Fails To Fill A Convincing Plot Around It,"The idea behind the premise of The Discovery is an interesting one but its implementation isn't as refined as expected and only works in bits n pieces. It's a thoughtful feature that experiments with existential elements and poses some intriguing questions but it neither presents it in a convincing manner nor remains thoroughly gripping.

Set in the near-future, the story of The Discovery takes place in a world where suicide rate is at an all-time high after a scientist's breakthrough research proved the existence of an afterlife. The plot follows his son who is skeptical of his father's discovery and a mysterious young woman he meets on a ferry who wants to find out more about the afterlife.

Co-written & directed by Charlie McDowell, the film opens with a prologue that skilfully sets up the future the rest of the plot unfolds in. For a while, it appears as if the director is taking more time to properly establish the characters & explore the metaphysical elements but the longer it continues to ponder over the same stuff, the more tedious it becomes.

The script is where the problem lies, for the brilliant hypothesis that the writers came up with isn't meticulously explored as if they couldn't figure out what to do with it, plus none of the characters inhabiting its future-setting are compelling enough. The plot wrapped around its theory begins on a promising note but by the time it ends, it finds itself in a familiar territory.

The cold colour palette, overcast ambiance & muted textures evoke a grim, hopeless future which fits the story requirements. Pacing is an issue as the movie plods through its 102 minutes runtime before concluding with a rushed ending. Rooney Mara, Robert Redford & Jesse Plemons play their part well but Jason Segel is severely miscast, and his chemistry with Mara is absolutely flat.

On an overall scale, The Discovery is one of those sci-fi flicks that teases with a fascinating idea but is unable to fill a compact & captivating narrative structure around it. Deficient in storytelling department and further marred by its cluelessness & lack of vision, it is a dull & sterile mess that had the opportunity to offer a sensory & stimulating experience but what it ultimately delivers is a cinematic ride that's as frustrating as it is hollow."
The Discovery,If you love low budget sci-fi with interesting ideas - this is a miss for you,"They bait you into thinking that this will provide for some interesting ideas for you to reflect on, but nope.

The main problem is that the story doesn't hold. I mean, the message of the movie is good and inspiring, but the story is just a mess that is full of holes.

They just took one good old movie and re-told it slightly adjusting the focus. I won't spoil it for you so check this out if you're interested anyways.

But be warned, this movie is slow and packs quite a run time. What's more interesting is that they actually stretch it out intentionally, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes they should've cut and it wouldn't hurt the movie. Probably they had a run time to meet or something.

The dialogue is often forced, some scenes are written so badly they are barely believable. Also, the lead seriously underperforms, his acting is unconvincing and he is unable to deliver emotional moments (you'll see).

If you're a hardcore sci-fi fan, the ending will disappoint you (mostly because of how random it is). But you will know long before that the movie is going nowhere."
The Discovery,Mediocre writing and directing wasted a great concept,"What a waste. The concept and overall story were fantastic. Unfortunately, that is where Netflix is showing its limits with Originals and the sub-par, lazy writing and directing that is barely above novice level. Even the great cast giving their best are unable to save it. This could have been an amazing, smart and original movie but ends up falling flat."

The Discovery,Kept watching because I wanted to like it.,"Watching a movie made around Jason Segel (playing mopey and morose to boot) is like trying to start a fire under a wet blanket. There was an occasional spark, an idea or twist, that reinvigorated a hope for something more. An appealingly moody colour palate, cold blues and greys. Interesting premise/s. Rooney Mara was great, as usual, bringing charisma to an otherwise desolate and charmless experience that inevitably led me to write this. As mentioned by so many people before me: what a disappointing waste of a phenomenal idea. This could have been something riveting. Perhaps my reception was tainted by Jason Segel's lack of likability. Is it my fault? In any case, I don't care. I'll have completely forgotten about this movie before I finish this..."
The Discovery,A huge waste of a great idea,"Talk about a wasted opportunity.

A fine cast led by the underrated Jason Segal (still doing his best to break out from his How I Met Your Mother persona and delivering a so-so turn when you look back at his role in End of the Tour) and backed up by Rooney Mara, Robert Redford and one of the finest supporting players going around Jason Plemon's isn't enough to save Charlie McDowell's Netflix original Sci-Fi/Drama The Discovery from a disappointing result and ending its runtime as one of the most frustratingly forgettable films in many a moon.

The core idea behind The Discovery, that Redford's scientist Thomas Harber has discovered evidence of a confirmed afterlife, leading to a world in which the suicide rates have ramped up to epidemic levels with Harber then working on a secret project that looks to record this afterlife for those alive to witness is a fantastic one and an idea that strikes up many a various conversation point but McDowell's film which ends up being more of an unbelievable romance between Segal's charisma free Will and Mara's mumbling and emo Isla than anything else feels unable to make the most of its idea.

Perhaps hampered by budget restraint's (although this hardly seems to be a problem for Netflix originals these days) or perhaps just a lack of overall vision. The Discovery showcases glimmers of what could be in stall for us whether it's the oft mentioned suicides, the cult like following Harber has garnered thanks to his work or Will's and Isla's investigation into a possible glimpse of the afterlife they have recorded but all these intriguing elements are quickly swept under the rug and while the film's final reveal makes the journey feel more rewarding than it actually is, you can't help but escape the feeling The Discovery has short-changed its viewers with a mediocre effort of a far more interesting story.

It's great seeing Netflix continue to invest in unique and original film properties but The Discovery will be marked down as one of their clear failures and while this intellectual thinking man's Sci-Fi has moments of greatness, overall this emotionally void experience is one of the dominate companies worst original studio efforts this side of their Sandler ""comedies"".

The Discovery,Underrated Existential Weirdness,"Don't know why this is getting some bad reviews. This was actually pretty darn good.

This movie has an interesting take on consciousness and death that is worth the time to watch. Perhaps people are not liking the existential weirdness and the questions it brings up but I enjoyed myself on this one.

I think we all need to ponder consciousness and reality a little more."
The Discovery,"Disappointing, due to the extremely promising premise and setup.","'THE DISCOVERY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)

A sci-fi romantic drama about a world where an afterlife has been scientifically proven, and how that knowledge drastically affects society. It was directed by Charlie McDowell, and it was written by McDowell and Justin Lade (the duo also teamed on 2014's 'THE ONE I LOVE'). The film stars Jason Segel, Rooney Mara, Robert Redford, Jesse Plemons, Riley Keough and Ron Canada. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through their streaming site. I found the movie itself to be a little disappointing, due to the extremely promising premise and setup.

The story takes place two years after 'the discovery of an afterlife', by Thomas Harbor (Redford). The scientific proof of an afterlife has caused an extremely dramatic increase in suicides. Thomas's son, Will (Segel), blames his father for the high suicide rate. He travels to see him, at an isolated mansion, where Thomas is doing more research on his findings. Will meets a suicidal woman on his trip, named Isla (Mara), who he later prevents from killing herself. He then brings Isla to his father's mansion, and the two assist him in his research there. The whole time Will is extremely skeptical about the damage they're doing to society, with these new findings.

The movie is extremely dark and depressing, for almost it's entire running length. Like I said, the idea for the film is really intriguing, and fascinating, but it's definitely not fun watching it play out. The performances are decent, and the climax is somewhat interesting, and unpredictable, as well. I had hoped for a lot more from it though, when I started watching it."
The Discovery,"Too ambitious, fails in form and substance","Just reading the synopsis raised my expectations, which is perhaps why the movie fell flat for me. Instead of an exploration of an intriguing idea, the film really became a declaration of faith in what is essentially a notion that cannot be proven and thus cannot really be known. When assertions are made about the mysteries of consciousness, you either believe them or you do not.

I would have given this a higher rating just for tackling such a difficult topic but the direction, acting and even cinematography never really came together. There were plenty of big, proven names who lent their prestige to this project and yet surprisingly none of the people involved seemed willing to commit. It was like they all knew the outcome would stink but no one wanted to sully their reputations by doing a bad job.

It is worth a watch if you are fans of some of the actors as I am. The arc of the plot is not unsatisfying even though it is in many instances frustrating. A film perhaps to while away the time and put yourself in a more contemplative mood."

The Discovery,A solemn exploration of life and death.,"Wow, this is a really cool, thoughtful and moving film. The kind of drama that really justifies film making because it explores the meaning and beauty of life in way that is emotive and intelligent.

The story is believable and intriguing and draws you into it's subtle mystery so that you really feel for the experiences that the characters themselves are having and their justifiable desire to unravel the mystery.

The pace of the drama is just right and never boring and there are numerous moments, that while not being comedic, make you smile or want to chuckle. But this film also deals with some really serious subjects in a mature and compassionate way. Overall it's a really beautiful and life affirming movie.

Highly recommended! :-)"

The Discovery,The most fascinating concept of the afterlife that I've ever seen in a movie.,Comentario no disponible
The Discovery,Hollywood still has some good ideas,"Solid film with an interesting story. The concept is great and probably a lot of people relate to it as it asks one of the biggest questions of humanity. Is there an after life and if there is how does it look like? I like that this is only the plot outline for something that goes very philosophical and even deeper. The twists were fine, and in the end it had a little bit of ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" spice. Acting wise everybody was on the top of their game. Nothing award worthy but believable enough. Jason Segel nicely played against his typical character and it was definitely an inspired choice to cast him in the leading role of this film. Rooney Mara was great as usual. She really is one of the most interesting and versatile actresses around these days. I liked Robert Redford, who wasn't doing anything too special but still absolutely right for his role. Jesse Plemons is always a plus. The screenplay was good and it had some really nice shots. Its a film that works for its characters and story more than any effects. It has a nice moral and good ending. Sometimes it was maybe a little slow and not all of the final conclusion makes sense but especially he last scene really hit me at the right spots."
The Discovery,"Fascinating concept and great ideas, but not much of a compelling story","""The Discovery"" is built on one of those sci-fi concepts that holds immense promise, to the point that it elevates expectations for the film's quality. After all, you don't make a film about what would happen if an afterlife were scientifically proved without being prepared to meaningfully and intelligently tackle the tremendous questions doing so would raise.

Challenge accepted for Charlie McDowell (""The One I Love""), who with co-writer Justin Lader attempts to do these themes justice on Netflix, which couldn't be a safer space to run this experiment. And that's by and large how ""The Discovery"" feels, a bit like a movie that wants to play with ideas rather than one that knows exactly the right story to tell to make its notions sink deeply in our in our minds and hearts.

Two years after Dr. Thomas Harbor (Robert Redford) has proved the existence of an afterlife, suicide rates are through the roof. Harbor's son Will (Jason Segel), who is less than fond of how society has reacted to this information, arrives on an island where his father has holed himself up in a mansion compound surrounded by Will's brother Toby (Jesse Plemons) and various survivors of attempted suicide. They are assisting Dr. Harbor in his search for the next level of truth — finding out what the afterlife is.

On his way to the island, Will meets Isla (Rooney Mara), a seemingly troubled woman whom he laters saves from attempting to drown herself. Will brings her to the mansion, where she becomes part of the ""cult"" and the two grow close as they help Harbor with his machine that attempts to record what the dead see in the afterlife.

The Segel-Mara/Will-Isla dynamic feels almost unsubtly like the romance between Joel and Clementine in the Charlie Kaufman-scripted ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" a similar high-concept indie, only the film is built around that romance. In this film, while you do have a comedian in a dramatic role attempting to keep up with an Oscar- nominated actress, their relationship feels shoe-horned into the narrative.

Segel is simply not capable of the nuance necessary to take this film to the next level. A leading performance in a high-concept mystery-drama-indie like this needs to serve as a bridge between the cerebral, intellectual properties of the film's core concept to the emotional ones. We need help understanding the consequences of a reality that is real in the film's universe but not real to us, and an actor showing us what that would feel like is our only chance. Segel doesn't do that, and it makes ""The Discovery"" come off as though it's too caught up in its conceit to tell a story worth telling.

It's also a scripting issue. Segel can't be blamed for how ineffectual the Will-Isla romance is. Mara has done romance before (""Carol"") and she's really good at it; Segel has his charms. The plot also gets too caught up in its mystery/thriller elements. At times these characters simply turn into detectives trying to answer the question of what happens when we die. The big reveal has an intellectual payoff, but again, it's not as moving as it might have been.

""The Discovery"" is a film grown from a fascinating seed of an idea, one that warrants a lot of discussion, but the surrounding story doesn't offer much in the way of informing that discussion other than starting it.

Nikki Glaser: Bangin',,
BAKI,Worth watching,"It's true, it doesn't have a great storyline, and a lot of stuff that happens doesnt make any sense at all. But it is worth watching. Its violent and crazy maybe even a little bit bizarre at times, but it makes me feel like what I would have imagined when I was younger playing around acting as if I was a super powerful ninja fighter or something, I know it is weird but that's what I like about it."
BAKI,"Dowright bizzare, but I don't hate it","A very bizzare experiment of an anime. The plot is nonsensical, fights are incredibly over the top gory, violent and packed with cliche dialog and exposition. Plot ? What plot? Honestly I completely lost track of what is even going on there, who is fighting who and why ? At times it feels like Baki him self is not even the main character but a B-plot. Also the animation quality is all over the place , from very flash-like ""handdrawn"" scenes to just PS2 era cell shaded 3D, absolutely no consistency. Despite of all of that, it is really out to lunch crazy and it's almost impossible to predict what it's going to happen next, and it's somewhat entertaining in that sense, like watching a live car pile up on the freeway after a snowstorm and cold made the roads all icy. It's good to kill some time in a lockdown."
BAKI,If you find violence attractive,"Watch Baki if you find violence attractive and when you really enjoy being presented with something that doesn't make sense. Avoid this if you need good production values and need to think hard about the experience before you. You may end up liking Baki, but respecting his rationality is not something I see happen to any viewer. Baki can be intriguing as long as you choose to watch what's going on instead of thinking about what's going on. It was designed as an experience for you to enjoy.

The Raitai tournament arc is easily one of my favorite arcs in all of Baki, the level of detail and animation made me enjoy it much more than I enjoyed reading the manga, and when there was a good fight, the fight was always top level, this arc has some of the best action in the entire series, but what held it back were some disappointing fights."
BAKI,Crazy mix but addictive,Comentario no disponible
BAKI,Its called Baki but it's not about Baki,Comentario no disponible
BAKI,Baki,"Baki is a action and martials arts series directed by Toshiki Hirono. The series stars Troy Baker and Sora Amamiya who play the rôle of Baki and Kozue. It was originally released in 4 June 2020.

As of now 3 seasons and 39 episodes are available.

The serie is entertaining , for me is the best anime with martials arts. The animation is very good."
BAKI,Talk about powerful,"I've heard so much about the famous Baki anime and to my very eyes it was boom, like a blast that would set you so far of the main logic of fighting animes out there this one's different, com to think of it it was like seeing anime in a new light though it was fight then you just gotta see what's up in the end and that's the drive, One season so far if that's recently but then you know the sequel if nothing to sneeze at, it's fighting your stuff then prove it here there's only one goal who's the strongest alive. But don't get your hopes up really cause this is just entertainment like watching two grownups pulling punches ."
BAKI,Outrageous action and story line but epic none the less,I started watching the series after watching a few YouTube clips but I have to say was hooked straight on. Do not expect a mind bending story line like death note or brotherhood. This is a full on 80-90s action series done really well.
BAKI,Little plot but still fun,"Meh. It's mostly just ""turn off your brain and enjoy the MANLY FIGHTING"" and I can appreciate the art of Baki but if I wanted to turn off my brain and be entertained I have more options. If you're more story oriented then avoid this."
BAKI,It Had the Potential,Comentario no disponible
BAKI,Carzy addictive,"Love everything about this anima it's so addictive and worth watching just an old school fighting series,"
BAKI,Not for everyone but very entertaining if given time,"A lot of the reviews on here sound like people that didn't know about Baki before this show's first season. To be fair, the first season starts very slow and doesn't pick up until after the first 13 episodes or so. But if you power through that or back track through the previous anime or the manga itself, you really get a good idea of the driving forces in Baki. It's not the kind of anime where the main character is going to do almost every fight like it other big shonen series sometimes do. Baki is a show grounded in its absurdity between ultra violence and disciplines of martial arts. I honestly love this show, the fights in this latest seasons especially are incredible with seeing some absolute powerhouse displays of fighting. If animes where power scaling and minimum lengths of several hundred episodes are the norm for battle anime Baki stands out especially,"
BAKI,Goes downhill real fast,Comentario no disponible
BAKI,"Great series, abysmal season ending","I'd rate it higher, but the season ending just feels extremely unprofessional, I might alter my rating once the second season is out, but regardless, it's a sloppy ending for an otherwise rather good series. I'd highly recommend waiting until March for the second season before watching this."
BAKI,Not for newcomers to anime,"Baki is not for everyone.

Anime can be slow paste and sometimes really hard to follow for people not a fan of the genre. For those people I would say leave baki for what it is and go see ""Kengan Ashura"" Baki has some impresive art and some truely amazing fighting scenes. it however lacks the anime humor and takes itself a bit too serious.

so a 6 out of 10 mainly because of the slow past and the story line not adding up"
BAKI,Awesome,A really good anime. I'm hoping for a new season with lots of episodes! Have fun watching you all!
BAKI,Alright but why the random 3D models???,I was enjoying the series but they kept adding these really ugly 3D models. They're so terrible and only in for a few seconds at a time. Why even bother with them??? I don't get it.
BAKI,"S3 is wonderfull, great animation and fights.","Definitly recommended, thrilling fights with mix of different martial arts makes it a compelling story for the viewer, especially those who enjoy epic fight scenes."
BAKI,"Cool fight scenes, too much rambling","Starts off pretty promising, but when a villain needs 10 whole minutes mid-fight to rant an overly detailed description of the weapon he just used to cut someones hand off, it gets boring real fast... But, when the fighting gets going, it's brutal, bloody and relentless, which makes up for a lot of the boring stuff."
BAKI,Just what on earth is going on..,"I don't understand what this anime is trying to do. The characters and the plot are all over the place and I really, really don't like the animation. I mean it looks cheap and I just don't like the artwork at all. Call me biased but I regret watching it.. Unlike Kengan Ashura that was a much more polished article this is just an absolute mess. If I had a word to describe it I'd call it 'whatever'.

Gave it 2 just for the intro music which I like for both seasons. Haven't watched the previous ones nor do i want to."
BAKI,enjoyable,"A intriguing and violent series, what I expected it to be ,co pared to deep complex storylines, it compares a fun fighting experience, like bloodsport."
BAKI,Just epic,"Baki is martial arts on its highest peak. Some scenes won't make sense but thats what martial arts would get if its used to that level. Fights scenes are not so good but this series focuses on story more than a fight scenes. This series will surprise you a lot of time thats what make us to watch it more. I really loved it, everyone should try it out"
BAKI,Baki is exactly what it's supposed to be but this season has some issues,"''Baki'' (2018) starts where the previous anime ''Grappler Baki'' left off and it jumps straight to the point. Death penalty prisoners, who are all beasts in their own respective way, escape in impossible manners and are on the hunt for every strong person so they can eventually, maybe, be defeated, which is something they still haven't felt being all-powerful as they think they are.
Baki and the crew decide to contest them and meet them head-on in series of skirmishes filled with martial arts and weapons because these prisoners aren't very prideful and they'll do anything to win. I would describe the show as if Mortal Kombat had an anime set in the modern age. Brutal fights, bizarre characters, and events, and all-around shlock. The animation is not that good but it really doesn't have to be. The art is pretty good but the sudden shifts between 2d and 3d are kind of jarring. The soundtrack is fine and though not better than the previous show it has the same feel, the opening songs are great, especially the second one. One more thing that was off is the way villains go from terrifying to not in the same league as our heroes, getting beat up by everyone and toyed around."
BAKI,Great Plot,"Plot The plot for Baki is a pretty typical plot that is used for most shows and movies. Baki Hanma is an 18 year old martial artist who is insanely strong with great fight IQ and skills. He has a girlfriend named Kosue and they are very intimate and in love with each other. Baki's whole purpose of fighting is to protect his girlfriend but it's mainly to be stronger than his father. Baki's father Yujiro Hanma is the strongest fighter on the entire planet. Yujiro is six foot three inches tall and he is two hundred sixty five pounds of solid muscle with virtually no body fat. Baki is five foot six and a very muscular one hundred sixty five pounds, with a burning hatred and disdain for his father. Baki also has an older brother named Jack who is an immensely large individual due to his immense steroid usage. Jack is a violent seven foot eleven inch man with astronomical power, but he is a generally relaxed person who doesn't say much. The whole plot of this show is the fact that Baki and Jack want to be stronger than their Father. The reason why Baki and Jack Hanma have such a strong hatred toward their father is because they were both conceived out of rape. The show doesn't show this but it is mentioned as the reason why Yujiro is seen as evil by most of the characters. Baki and Jack come from different mothers, but both of their mothers exact identity is unknown and not really mentioned in the show. Yujiro However, is known to have raped and killed both of their mothers. The only negative thing to the show is that it gets side tracked with a lot of fight scenes to introduce the other characters."
BAKI,Good fight scenes but maybe a bit long,"This anime is THE anime you need to watch if you are looking for realistic kung-fu fights or just normal street fights .

Though the series might get a little boring when you are towards the end you will enjoy it more due to the fighting tournament but I am not going to spoil any of it otherwise this wouldn't be a good recommendation.

About 99% of the people who enjoyed this show will likely feel invincible and will feel like having secret fighting techniques that show deadly to others .

Doesn't exactly contain a plot but still interesting if you like fighting ."

Love on the Spectrum U.S.,A beautiful thing to see,"It's extremely heartwarming to see how people can be so caring towards others.

I come away from watching this show thinking hoping the best for those involved as they truly deserve the best things it life.

Great little watch."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,It is unbelievable sweet...,"Like the original.

It's decently portrayed without mocking or shaming anybody. And it's raising awareness for autism.

It's so unbelievable sweet and heart-warming, it really soften your heart. And it's a reminder that you will never know the whole story of someone's behaviour."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,"great watch, super insightful","Really, really wholesome and heartwarming. Loved the aus version, and the us version is just as good! It's been a while since I've seen some good non-toxic reality tv."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Rare treat,Just as delightful as the previous version from Australia. Life affirming and lovely. I only wish I could be friends with them all! Only disappointment is that there aren't enough episodes. Please keep making this show!
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Heartwarming,"I love how this show portrays austim as it truly is, a diverse spectrum. No two people on the spectrum are alike. There are a lot of stereotypes and ignorance out there and I feel this show along with the Australian version will help shed light on how truly unique each and everyone is on the spectrum."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Wonderful,"I can't say enough good things about this series as well as the original show from Australia dealing with adults on the spectrum looking for love. The filmmakers treat all participants with respect and caring and we the audience become fully invested in their happiness. This series emphasizes that no matter what difficulties/disabilities a person has, we all have the right to love and be loved. Bravo Netflix!"
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,So refreshing!,"No lies, nobody being fake to impress, just complete honesty. It was so refreshing to watch a dating show where there was no one making drama for the sake of drama. I was only disappointed at one point and that was when it was over. I wanted more."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Absolutely incredible!,"Growing up with a mom who devoted her life to working with children on the spectrum I may be a bit biased, but this show is just incredible! To see these beautiful people searching for love is astounding. My mom always worked with very young kids who I rarely got to see grow up, sadly. This show is so pure and perfectly produced. Letting these amazing people find themselves and hope for love and a partner is just so heartwarming. I love this way this show gives us an inside to autism and people in the spectrum that we normally don't get to see. It's amazing how much you can identify with these people as a neurotypical. They want and fear the same things as everyone else, especially in dating. It's beautiful to see these people come out of their shells and face their fears. It actually gives me more confidence in my own life to see this show. I hope it never ends and we see more like this."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Neurodiversity,"With so many great minds and inventors being neurodivergent, including Albert Einstein himself, it seems strange that neurodiversity, also known as the autism spectrum, remains largely misunderstood by the majority who are neurotypical. Many neurodivergent people go through life without being fully aware of their neurodiversity and some never reach diagnosis in their lifetime because autism was not well-understood and widely diagnosed in children until the 1990s.

Love on the Spectrum brings much needed awareness to the difficulties faced by neurodivergent people in a neurotypical world and humanises them. With increasing visibility of sexual and gender diverse populations, it is time for greater understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity. Successful neurodivergent people like Jennifer Cook, who makes an appearance as the autism expert and whose book ""Autism in Heels"" I have read, are shining examples of what autistic people can achieve when they allowed to express their creativity and individuality in spite of the bounds of the neurotypical world."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Need more episodes!,I'm so pissed there are only six episodes in this season there should be more! This is one of the best reality show so far. Pure and innocent people trying to find love.
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Insulting garbage,"What I hate about this show, as well as many of the reviews, that this show continues to ""other"" people on the spectrum.

This is a voyeuristic exercise, with the insulting premise that maybe these people deserve love too and they definitely need help from someone else

Of course they deserve love! And they do it without the help of condescending TV shows that exist to publicize their relationships and failings.

And the condescending reviews of ""I love them all"" or ""I want to be friends with them"" are disgusting. Go out into your community and actually meet people on the spectrum, they won't bite.

I can't wait until the sequel shows ""Love in a Wheelchair"" and ""Blind Love"", where we give those other poor disabled people a chance at love that they can't have without the help of those strong able bodied people. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the participants are just stuck here, but the show around the whole thing is repulsive."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,As good as it gets,"Heartwarming series which beautifully shows how much we all want to love and be loved as told through several lovable individuals on the spectrum. You root for everyone in the series to find love, some do while others keep trying. Each story is so well told. This is my favorite series on Netflix and I've enjoyed every season."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,So sweet,Comentario no disponible
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,The greatest show ive ever seen and I will tell you why,"I myself have been ignorant as a child and adult to the diffilcuties people in life that I dont share myself. This show really opens your eyes to the beauty we share as human beings wanting love and connection regardless of phsyical or mental differences we have as people. We all crave to be loved, embraced, cared for and wanted, this show really opened my eyes to understand that we all need to be more patient with one another as humans because we all have different backgrounds, experiences and cognitive abilities.

This show has made me tear up more times then I will admit, lol, but its because of how beauitful it is to see people overcome challenges and love life so unconditonally. The people on this show and their families inspire me to have my own family one day and give them at least 1/10 of the love these parents show for their kids. If you have a heart you will love this show and smile and cry because its amazing to see the power of adversity and compassion can play in our world if we just try to understand each other more."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,BEAUTIFUL,"This show is amazing! I had a smile on my face the whole time! Such beautiful souls just wanting what all humans want, a true loving connection with someone! This taught me so much about autism! Such awesome people!!!"
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,The most lovely experience,"What an absolute lovely show. These people are so sweet, and their families are so supportive. I believe the producers handled this show with such care, it's truly a special experience. We binged the entire season and by face hurt from smiling for so long. To see a dating show void of the disgusting antics made popular in the 21st century is so refreshing. I loved the characters and was excited to see where each story went. 63-year old Steve's story was my favorite. Even after all these years, the need for love and companionship was still there. If you want to smile, laugh, cry and feel good, I honestly can't recommend this show enough. Truly lovely."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,So wholesome!!,This show rocks! I found myself smiling the whole time that I watched this. It's so pure and wholesome. I'm rooting for everyone on here. This show really opened my eyes on Autism.
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Best Love on the Spectrum Yet!,"What a wholesome cast, I'd love to see their stories continued in Season 2. It was so heartwarming and I loved them all! Finished Season 1 in one day!!"
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Not sure,"Although the show is well made and captivating, I'm not sure I am comfortable with what is essentially monetizing a disability, I hope the participants were well compensating.

In many instances I felt like the production team didn't try very hard and matched functioning autostic people with potential partners with Dawn syndrome, which is probably creating confusion in the audience since they're not the same thing.

I'm also not sure that autism was accurately represented in this series or that people on the spectrum were.

It seems like producers ran out of ideas and figured out one day ""let's just make a circus of people's disabilities and make sure we make the family members famous too"".

The participants themselves are mostly sweet people and you want them to be happy and find a partner but maybe a TV show is not the right setting for it."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,As someone on the spectrum I find this show very inspiring,"Both Australian and US shows are simply excellent. I love everything about them - music, directing, camera work etc but most importantly I love all the characters because I can relate to each and one of them. It's like in all of them I see bits and pieces of myself. I totally understand when they say they don't like certain sounds, smells or tactile sensations, I understand how anxiety is part of our everyday lives and how routine is super important. And despite all those ""limitations"" being able to find someone who likes you and who you like for who they are is simply beautiful. I'm so grateful these shows exist because they inspire me to look for love and give me hope that it is possible."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,I'm neurodivergent and loved this very much.,"So often, ASD is presented in film and TV as bluntness, or savantry. Sometimes both. It's such a lazy caricature.

The participants who featured in Love on the Spectrum are a wonderful example of just how diverse the symptoms and implications of ASD can be. They also do a great job of highlighting how one person's 'simple act' that they take for granted, can often be a massive challenge for someone in a different situation.

I loved hearing all of the different expressions of what love means and what the participants are looking for in a partner. There was so much hope and joy in this show that it's impossible not to be drawn into rooting for everyone!

The production team did a great and respectful job that helped to retire tired old tropes and, in doing so, showed us that we have more in common than that which divides us. Bravo to all of you."
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Enjoyable,It was lovely seeing the experiences these individuals have as they search for love. They all seem so sweet. James needs his own show and Steve has an amazing voice!
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Wholesome!,"The purest, sweetest show ever! Really helps you understand and have better compassion for people on the spectrum, and also just breaks the stigma on Autism in my opinion. It's a beautiful show that will keep you smiling! Highly recommend!"
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Beautiful,"I just smiled the whole time watching it! All the participants are so amazing in their own unique ways. I truly cared for each of them and hope they all find the love they deserve. Steve and Dani just kept me smiling so much. I could just feel how much they cared about people through the show! But they were all so sweet and caring, kind and respectful. I'm so glad I found this and watched it, it truly brought me some happiness!"
Love on the Spectrum U.S.,Sweet and simple,"Whether or not you're neuro-divergent, I bet that the average viewer will be able to connect with the participants and can learn a thing or two about creating solid relationships. This is a relevant series, as dating online or blind dating can be an intimidating event for anyone. And I especially like how you see that everyone on the show has a strong support system at home."

...I was hooked from the opening sequence of this new show, which almost made me choke on my biscuit. I thought it was very funny, well acted, well paced, good effects; and nice use of a frankfurter sausage for comedy effect!

Having been a teenager in the '90's, I did find myself making the obvious comparisons with BTVS. But, although the basic premise are comparable, this seemed to have a very different flavour to Buffy. In BTVS, our heroine was fighting to save the world; so far as I could tell from episode 1, there were no such lofty or noble aspirations for the war waged on demons, which I find refreshing. Also, the humour is so British the show might as well come with complimentary cups of tea and wellington boots.

I am more than happy to sit down and watch episode 2 next week. Fingers crossed I come away feeling as happy as I did after 1!"
Crazyhead,Confused why canceled,It's like Buffy meets Supernatural but funnier. And I hate British comedies usually. Confused with the tons of garbage series on Netflix that lasts for 3 more and this was canned. Just lost. I found this out of boredom. Oh well. Enjoy what ya have if it. Those two ladies are quite charming and hilarious.
Crazyhead,The guy behind Misfits does it again,"I recently discovered the British TV series Misfits, a wonderfully weird thing about kids with superpowers, and after I finished it I looked around for something else by its creator, Howard Overman.

I wasn't impressed with the first episode of his next series, Atlantis, but now with Crazyhead he returns to the same mix of action, humor, and insanity as Misfits.

Following the adventures of two girls able to recognize bodies possessed by demons, the series is not quite as original as Misfits. While that show was a superpowers show without superheroes, Crazyhead treads along the lines of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, except there's an extra heroine and fewer side kicks.

But the show's very funny, particularly Susan Wokomo as Raquel, the characters are likable and the story is engaging.

I don't know why Atlantis wasn't better (maybe it gets better later?) but I'm happy that Overman has hit another home run."
Crazyhead,After two episodes.......,"Mind you, I am well beyond the target demographic and I am loving it. As a child of the 90's, now mid thirties I guess I am not looking for shows like this.

At first I was like 'oh no, not again!'. Then I was like 'Hold on, let me see more'. Now I am like 'Gimme gimme gimme'.

Much to my surprise this has been reviewed only once. It must have not made it across the pond yet, and there must be a freaking serious lack of British on IMDb. Also, Americans don't understand the Brits? It appears to be only a 6 part series, but the first two episodes were kinds fun to watch. Dialogues that are humorous make the big difference, though the production isn't bad at all, the acting fair enough and the storyline of course a bit absurd.

I wouldn't be surprised if there will be a US version of this soon, or if this gets picked up somewhere in the future and gets the praise it deserves. It is much much better than dozens of poor shows that airs lately (like Bull, Aftermath, Channel Zero, Conviction, Aftermath and horrendous mishaps like Too Close to Home).

Americans, sit back, relax, enjoy, let the British humor surprise you............ Take it from a Dutch!"
Crazyhead,Bring it back you cowards,"Listen, I'm not saying whoever decided to cancel Crazyhead after one season deserves to be taken out behind the shed and dealt with, I'm just saying the entire entertainment industry should get a restraining order against someone who's obviously off their entire rocker."
Crazyhead,Hilarious. Very well done,"Surprised Netflix did not give this a second season, this was an entertaining and quick watch. Very very funny, laughed out loud a few times."
Crazyhead,Solid.,"It pains my soul that shows this well written and created of pure charisma can failed to be renewed. I understand how the masses can determine success but the the masses have proven time and time again not to be an adequate judge of quality. Crazyhead was unpredictable, original, and entertaining. A great addition to anyone seeking a comfortable lineup for a good day on the couch or with friends."
Crazyhead,I'm done with tv,"They've finally done it, I am now too weary of investing in a show for it to be cancelled. I'm sticking to movies and music from now on.

This is a great show that deserved at least 3 seasons. In fact minimum contracts should be 3 seasons. They either put it on and let it run or don't show it at all."
Crazyhead,Amazing! Watch it now,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I was scrolling through Netflix looking for something new to watch. But this grabbed me from the episode opener. And then when I watched the second episode, I was immediately hooked and I could not stop watching. Raquel is equal parts hilarious and insane (which makes me love her more). Amy is equal parts sweet and awkward (which makes me love her more). Amy's awkward humor had me laughing so hard in the second episode I almost choked. The play off each other nicely, and the chemistry is great throughout the season.

The best description that I read of this show was that its part supernatural, part BTVS, and part Broad City. That description is pretty on point. But it is by no means a ""monster of the week show"". The twists and turns kept me guessing, and while it leaves it open for another season, the show is tied together nicely in the end. Highly recommended."
Crazyhead,good potential,"Amy is taken off her meds and hallucinations of demons hiding in everyday people return. She is saved by fellow seer Raquel Francis from one such demon. Raquel has mandatory psych unit visits, wacky ideas, and lives with her hunky brother Tyler. Amy's work friend Jake from the bowling alley has a crush on her. Her best friend Suzanne is taken over by a demon trying to kill her. The girls try to perform an exorcism and are rescued by a demon named Sawyer who turns out to be Raquel's dad. Sawyer asks Harry to defend Rachel against Callum and his minions including vicious single mom demon Mercy.

Misfits is a favorite and this is another one from creator Howard Overman. At least, I'm intrigued from the start. The two leads have an interesting fun chemistry. They need more from their supporting characters. Tyler is a bit stiff. Jake is not pathetic enough. Sawyer is killed before real emotional stakes are established. Mercy is quite a compelling villain but Callum is only a standard prick in a suit. He has his fun but he's not scary. It might be more intense to have Amy and Raquel portrayed as teens discovering this world for the first time. Hormonal teens are usually more intense and their inferiority allows for greater danger. This show has good potential but I doubt it's getting more than the six episodes."
Crazyhead,Love it!,"Loved it from the first minute. It has a Misfits feeling, with dirty humor, idiotic situations and attitudes, a few clichés, yet the two main characters are lovable and sweet while being total bad-asses.I know, we all miss a good Nathan or Woody in our lives, but the delicious, quick-witted Raquel is the right kind of awkward to root for, awesomely completing the sensitive and sweet Amy in all things new and dangerous.

The bad guy is a walking cliché, all-drama-evil-laughter-devious-plans-dude, but seeing how well the other characters are built, I can't help but think this is what was intended for him.

The special FX are not spectacular, but they don't feel forced and still manage to get you in the right mood.

Do try it for at least two episodes before you make up your mind about it, you'll probably have a charming, fresh, pleasant surprise!"
Crazyhead,Delightfully weird taste; sadly lacking in everything else...,"The only reason this got a 6 out of 10 was for the awesome, refreshing boldness in it's authentically tasty weird style... and yet... no substance.

I tried really hard to like this, even claiming it was good and ""my new show"" despite then somewhat laboring to get through each episode after episode (I draw the line after 4 episodes).

I love Raquel's character. The blonde friend (which is sidekick I can't tell) is decent and can pull off some kind of chemistry. You can tell this show is really trying to pull it together with the other characters. I'm not saying there's nothing there, but it's not even close to enough. That with the lack of substance in writing, lack of depth and flavor in the characters (Raquel has flavor for sure, but not so much depth) and overall just no payout really leaves me sad because of how badly I truly wanted this to be awesome.

There's a lot of ""glitter"" enough to spark your curiosity, and many attempts made to appease our appetite by some raunchy bold humor every now and then.

The marketing is truly wonderful because of what's available to work with. From there it is pretty much a lot of minor letdowns."
Crazyhead,"great show, why not watch?","This show is amazing. That is all. Watch it if you want to watch something great. I mean I guess I need 5 lines, but I really don't want to give spoilers. It's just an awesome show. It's funny, and touching and scary at times. It's suspenseful but also you can guess some things along the way so it's a fun mystery. It's just an excellent show. So go watch it...why not?"
Crazyhead,Decent background noise,"Gritting through three episodes, I can honestly say that creators confused originality with 'being badly patched together'.

I thought this would be a coming of age story in an urban fantasy framework. Content does not feel like a well-structured urban low- fantasy. Internal reality does not rely on established fantasy and it does not have anything original. Awkward instances seem like they are forcing cringe comedy. Sloppy and exaggerated action gives it a weak sit-comish feeling. So, it is annoying as a comedy and under performing as action. Characters are as deep as a tea cup and if there is any character development, I congratulate creators on making it really, really subtle. Plot has no attractiveness and I'm just waiting for creators' ""witness how interesting my idea was"" moment.

TL;DR Banality with glitter"
Crazyhead,demons and comedy,"The series is in the comedy-horror genre, but even though it's called horror, I think the comedy aspect outweighs it and it's enjoyable to watch. There is a good friendship, albeit absurd, in the series. It is enjoyable to watch the stories between Amy and Raquel. Adding a demon element to the comedy makes the show even more enjoyable. The color palettes of the series are generally light, but it gets darker in some scenes. If you want to watch a funny and short series about demons, Crazyhead is for you."
Crazyhead,Wwwhhhyyyyy?!!?!!!!!???,I cannot believe that I just found this show now(11/2018) it is awesome!!! So much fun & great acting!!! I am so upset that there aren't anymore!! 😢
Crazyhead,One season is enough,"Watchable but it took an age and a lot of vile sexual dialogue mostly involving female private parts to get to the finale and by this time my interest had been removed, at least for watching a second season which unsurprisingly never came. Still I got through. I liked the cast mostly, in particular Susan Wokoma (Raquel) and Tony Norman's villain (Callum). I didnt like Cara Theobold as Amy. She is just to wooden and she has one expression throughout the entire series. Not a bad series one but I can understand why it was cancelled as I think it was a one trick pony."
Crazyhead,If you like fresh fantasy and a/just the right bit of character study: come along,"I really liked this show, I am so glad I stumbled across it, because it is a lot of fun watching it. If you like battling demons: come along. If you like fresh fantasy, come along. If you like buddy constellations or (pretty much outsider) girls finding their way through life/ their youth, come along. If you like fancy Halloween parties, come along. I cannot see that the show is lacking depth in characters, because this is definitely not the kind of show you turn to, if you want to watch profound character profiles. This is a fun fantasy show and it serves fans of such fully, and in addition, for this genre, the characters are very round. More character elaboration would have been harmful to the entertainment side, so well-done, I could have watched a lot more of it!"
Crazyhead,Crazy Demon Hunters On The Prawl!,"It's a fun show. It's a little unique as they are all chasing demons and battling their own demons. The lead protagonists are female which is great. There is a great core of diverse actors.

The acting talent is very good. I like the script. It is a bit of a piss-take but the humour is there. I like that. It's just a fun pop-corn show to binge on and I think it does that job very well!

It's definitely not the best vampire/demon tv show but it is a very strong tv series which run at six episodes. Lots of poeple are confused as of why it is not longer-running. I don't think it's possible to continue these type of shows with multiple series when the concept of the show has been met.

It's well-worth a watch! 7/10."
Crazyhead,This is what happens when Buffy is done right!,"Excellent British horror-comedy.

If you loved Buffy the Vampire slayer back when and always wish someone would make a good gritty but funny and possibly British version- this is your lucky day!"
Crazyhead,Hooked,Such a great show! I waited and waited for the 2nd season to drop - ended up being bitterly disappointed when it wasn't renewed!
Crazyhead,TV's golden age,"More like TV's golden shower age. Same pap wrapped up in new shiny Brit cuteness. Otherwise obnoxious and kill worthy demon hunter (the originality is palpable) recruits dippy blonde who starts thinking that the CGI demons (so scary) she's seeing are real. It's the same old tedium that began with Buffy, continued with ""Ash the Evil Dead Whatsit"" and has continued on with shows like Dirk Gently (which actually predates all this stuff) wherein the jaded protagonists view the supernatural world with comic disdain and predictability, and it's a dirty job ridding the world of all these demonic meanies, but someone's gotta do it, right? Not really. The two dimensional world the people inhabit in Crazyhead begs the question..is it really worth it? It's so lame you might find yourself siding with the mediocre computer-faced demons, that is, if you can stand to sit through one episode of this boring tween pablum."
Crazyhead,Good plain fun,"Crazyhead. Two young women who can see demons, one who is half demon and go around kicking their butts back to hell. Seemed like a silly enough premise for a show to be funny. Well, I watched all 6 episodes of season 1 and found out it was! Nothing to strain your brain on here, nothing to get up in arms about or deep enough to argue about. You'll find it funny or not. It is just the right combo of stupid and funny to keep me laughing through every show. Not a lot to comment on here as the show is simple. They keep the story simple. The characters are likable and their friends stupid likable. Add it all together and I got a good laugh. Looking forward to more in Season 2."
Crazyhead,Hilarious horror-comedy,"This was a jewel we just happened on while browsing Netflix. We had not heard of it anywhere but the title and some tiles that accompany it on the site were enough to convince us to give it a try. After all, cost nothing right? In one episode we were so hooked I was already grumbling about the short 6 episode season. Make no mistake - the best thing about this show is the banter. The back and forth between Rachel, Amy, and Jake is absolutely priceless. We turned on closed captions so we wouldn't miss a thing (especially since the English accents here can be a bit thick). It takes a lot to get outright belly laughs out of me but this show had me howling at times. Especially one scene where Amy punts a rabbit in the woods. Man I hope this gets a green light for another hopefully longer season! Give it a try."
Crazyhead,Another great show gone....,"I still cant believe they decided not to renew this show. The dynamic between the two leads was just so awesome. It took a premise that has been done so often and out a spin on it. It was exciting, quirky and witty. This is yet another show with a great rating and reviews that gets canceled prematurely. This confirms that shows dont stay on the air because they're ""good"" or ""hits"". It must be some predetermined thing, where money changed hands. I guess this is why shows like Lucifer got taken off the air at the height of its fame and popularity, while shows like desperate housewives droned on for like a decade.

I guess these reviews dont really matter either"
Fuller House,Makes me smile,"This may sound silly but the lameness and nostalgia of this show make my laugh and smile. I genuinely feel happy when i watch it and it helps me relax. The new kids also do a great job. Great after a bad day this show. Credit to everyone, as this is a hard task to brighten peoples days."
Fuller House,"Doesn't reinvent the wheel, but that's not a bad thing.","Like a pair of well-worn shoes or catching up with an old friend, Fuller House doesn't break the mold but is refreshingly dependable: this is truly for the fans. You know what you're getting when you jump in, so if you weren't a fan of the original series, it may not be your cup of tea. If you were a fan growing up or catch the reruns, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Sure, some of it is familiar and fits into the sitcom template, but that is not a bad thing at all. The first episode truly feels like the finale we never got for Full House while also planting the seeds for the rest of the season. It's nice to see the original cast all together one more time, and it's especially refreshing to see the trio of ladies that anchor the rest of the season have not missed a beat.

I binged the entire season the moment I woke up this morning for its debut and it was everything I was hoping for. I was pleasantly surprised that it met & surpassed my expectations, had me laughing out loud every episode, and even some of the elements I wasn't a fan of (for me, the kid who played Max was a bit much at times) had their redeeming moments (some of his jokes miss wildly, yet others caught me off-guard with their hilarity).

To me, the two standout elements were some suggestive humor bits (still harmless enough for children) and Andrea Barber's portrayal of Kimmy Gibler: Kimmy may have gotten older in age, but she hasn't changed one bit which is s good thing for us. I'm already looking forward to the next season! 8/10"
Fuller House,"I want to love it, but it isn't the same","I grew up watching full house and being the same age as Stephanie, I related to her quite a bit. I loved growing up with the show and seeing it when new shows came out and then when I had my two daughters, we watched all the reruns of it on Nick. They fell in love with the show as well. I knew it was a clean, family friendly show that I didn't have to worry about.

When I found out that Fuller House was coming out, not only was I so excited about it, but my kiddos were too. When I got home the night that it premiered on Netflix, we couldn't wait and watched five episodes.

Don't get me wrong, there are funny pieces and the kids and Kimmy are the best part of the show. But it isn't the same. It definitely is not family friendly.

There is so many sexual innuendos and cursing that I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep watching with my kids. This made me sad because I was hoping for a clean, family, friendly show for them that we could watch as a family. Unfortunately, it did not turn out that way.

I will say that I love the kids that play in the show--they were perfectly cast. And Kimmy hasn't changed a bit. I love that part of her. She was always a goof ball and still is. I wish I could rate this higher, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Still good to watch, just be aware that there are some comments, scenes and words that are not family friendly if you care about letting your kids watch that."
Fuller House,"Wow, much better than expected","I watched the first four episodes today on Netflix, and I must say, i was pleasantly surprised. I was having doubts of this return / reboot of one the cutest family shows from the 80s/90s, but the show blew me away from the Pilot episode. DJ, Stefanie and Kimmi are back, now as grown ups where DJ needs to raise her 3 sons by herself, and of course require help. Danny, Jessie and Joey are also back, mainly as guest stars im guessing throughout the season. The show starts fresh with frequent recalls of events of the older show, the director even gives us split screen scenes with both the new and older show scenes playing. Subtle funny moments and not going over the top as i was expecting, with hilarious puns and jokes from the older show. The family battle newer challenges with their newer kids like the obsession with electronic tablets, etc Sadly, there is no Michelle, that the whole cast acknowledge in quite a funny way during the first episode! Who knows, she might be brought back in the future. In summary, such a great, heartwarming and funny reboot for the whole family to enjoy"
Fuller House,Don't listen to the critics - check it out for yourself,"Before I started watching Fuller House, I read a bunch of reviews and was so disappointed that it was getting ripped to shreds that I almost didn't give it a chance, but curiosity got the best of me and I started watching. To echo some of the other reviewers, yes, the first episode is incredibly cheesy and feels more like an homage to the old cast than an introduction to a new show, but after just the main cast of Fuller House is left, I found it actually quite fantastic.

Some say that it's just rehashing the original show and in a lot of ways, they *have* taken an extremely similar storyline, but beyond that it is totally its own. But what I absolutely love about it is that it feels like a 90s sitcom. I grew up watching Full House, Boy Meets World, Family Matters, etc., and I miss all of those shows. When Girl Meets World came out, I was excited for that one also, but was disappointed in how it turned out. However, Fuller House can stand on its own two legs without their Full House background and I have been very pleasantly surprised.

Nowadays there really isn't much family friendly material on TV; there are very few shows that aren't filled with innuendo, language, sex, and so on. But Fuller House stays true to the Full House values and while it may be cheesy at times, each episode has a moral to the story where someone learned something and is better for having learned it. It teaches the audience what's really important in life and how much families really matter.

If you're looking for a Modern Family type of show, you will not find that in Fuller House, but if you're missing the sitcoms of the 90s that you could comfortably watch with your whole family, you will love Fuller House."
Fuller House,It's okay,"Obviously the original is better! The forced laughter gets annoying and some scenes are cringey to watch but asides from that, it's watchable"
Fuller House,Annoying crowd noise and a lot of over acting,The annoying 'Wooooooo' every other second is what driving me away from this.
Fuller House,The perfect show 4 a estressful people!,"If you want to relax, not to think for a while and have fun this is the perfect show for you. And the best part of all, is that you travel in time, to your childhood!!"

Fuller House,"Relatively Enjoyable, Doesn't Stand Out (Some Spoilers)",Comentario no disponible
Fuller House,"If you liked Full House, you'll love Fuller House!","Let me just start by saying that I rarely ever give anything a 10 star rating. I just finished watching all 13 episodes in one sitting, and I couldn't get enough of it. I'm sick to death of all the negative reviews this show is getting. I don't know how you can be a fan of the original, and not love Fuller House. I went in with very low expectations, and still can't believe how much I enjoyed it. Look, I'm not above criticism. I can't even watch a rerun of Full House without cringing, and though I found myself cringing a couple of times during Fuller House it wasn't bad cringing. The show didn't try to reinvent itself to match today's times. It was Full House part 2. Anyone criticizing Fuller House either wasn't a fan of the original, or hasn't watched it in so long that they forgot what the show actually was. It was never must-see TV. It was fun. A lot of people tend to get all bent out of shape over fan service, but I am the complete opposite. The more fan service the better. I can never get enough of that stuff. If you're looking for callbacks to the original, and classic catch phrases you won't be disappointed. Fuller House delivers in every way that it could, and more. It's nice to see that in a world where everything else is different, the Tanner's remain the same. They say that this was for the fans, and whether true or not IMO they fully delivered. Don't listen to the negative reviews. If you liked the original you most likely will like this one as well. I know I did."
Fuller House,Nostalgic,Comentario no disponible
Fuller House,Love the series however.......,"It's not something I could watch more than once. All my other favorite sitcoms like home improvement, everybody loves Raymond, the Nanny and even early seasons of full house I can watch over and over. This one however, just doesn't have a great story. I love the actors, they're so great. It just seems the whole series is based on DJ Tanner and her love life with other small stories on the side but mostly about her. Really isn't much else. I was kind of excited about season five but already into six episodes and I'm bored. Only wish they'd shared the camera with more actors a little more often. It just seemed to me that DJ took the spotlight most the time."
Fuller House,Excellent - Don't Believe The Critics,"The critics didn't understand why people liked the first Full House so much and they don't understand Fuller House either. This show was great - it lived up to my personal hype! I was practically raised on this show and it didn't disappoint. The mix of nostalgia, the feel, and even the new ""meta"" comments totally fit. As a 30 year old I am right in Fuller House's wheelhouse and I identify with the characters, like I did as a kid. Stephanie was my first-ever crush, and it's interesting that she's where I am in life now too (trying to stay young, be free).

The cast's chemistry never went anywhere, and their pure delight on being on this show shines through. The premise is great, the new characters are good (especially cheeky Ramona) and there are so many great places the show can go with its story. The old cheesy humour remains, but the show is self-aware and points fun at it in great ways. In fact, the irony of how this show comes off in 2016 is part of the genius.

This show is satisfying my itch and my soul, do not pass it over because some critic says it's bad."
Fuller House,"Nostalgic fun, vastly improves after the first episode","So, I grew up with the original and sure, it was cheesy and dated, but had great characters and a lot of heart.

Fuller House...is pretty much exactly the same. Not that that's a bad thing! In this day and age, such a show is welcome.

The Tanner girls (sans Michelle) and Kimmy take the roles of their uncles/dad in the original, raising DJ's three sons along with Kimmy's daughter in the same house. The pilot is basically a reunion episode and isn't exactly great. It's forced and kinda cringeworthy. But when that's over, the show really takes off. The three leads all do a great job (and aged pretty darn well, if you catch my drift), and the new kids aren't too bad either. Max especially--that kid is going to be a star.

There's a nice mix of humor here, family stuff and some more adult stuff for older viewers. Yes, there's a laugh track. Yes, it feels forced in parts. But so did the original. If you're even remotely a fan, you'll love it."
Fuller House,Fuller House,"The entire universe is excited for Fuller House. It is phenomenal to see the entire gang return, but it would've been a honor to see Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen return. We all miss Michelle. The original Full House series brought so much happy memories and laughs. Fuller House brings true joy from that glad it's back. The entire cast looks stunning and they came along way over the years. Everyone does a fantastic job towards every role. The new child stars especially Michael Campion, Elias Harger, and the beautiful Soni Bringas are so amazing and talented. It's awesome to see new young youths a part of the show. Full House fans are in for a ride and will be watching this one forever. We're are thankful to be a part of this creation and believe it is a hit. Much love and a shout-out to Jeff Franklin, Candace Cameron Bure, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, Bob Saget, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, and the directors. We pray that Fuller House continues on for decades with more and more outstanding seasons. We vote this one: #FullerHouse beyond extraordinary, a childhood classic! family comedy! that everyone can connect to. THANKS BIG TIME!"
Fuller House,Over the top is exactly what it is..,Overall it's a kind remake of the old classic. The only problem is the over the top acting & producing by Candace Cameron Bure. The rest of the cast is good & light hearted. The scripts have a cheesy tone that leaves you parched with a dryness & the flatness of the lines they say throughout the series. I for one am glad it's ending.. Goodbye Fuller House.
Fuller House,Second Hand Embarrassment,"Fuller House has all the hallmarks of an abysmal sitcom. The comedy ranges from the standard ""adult"" jokes to flat one-liners. The writing is dull and predictable. The child actors are pathetic and unconvincing. The laugh track is extremely irritating and forced. Candace Cameron, along with the other OG actors, are awkward in their new roles. It's painfully obvious that they haven't busted out their acting chops in years. Full House was no masterpiece (by any means necessary), but at least there was decent jokes and heart put into it. Fuller House is nothing but a money-making exploit on people's blind nostalgia."
Fuller House,Nostalgia at its finest!,"Attention all Full House fans! You will not be disappointed! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed myself and how well the writing is. It was definitely a nod to fans with its Full House references but there are plenty of modern day topics addressed to keep it fresh and entertaining for new audiences. It was funny, and cheesy (isn't it supposed to be cheesy?) and heartfelt. I'm so grateful to get to revisit one of my favorite shows from my childhood. I really hope they are renewed for more seasons to come. I also hope the Olsen twins have a change of heart and at least come back for a cameo. Watching all of the old cast members return was like visiting family that you haven't seen in years, their friendship and chemistry is apparent through the screen. Bravo to the cast and producers!"

Fuller House,Fuller House is even worse than the original,"I totally agree with the critics on this show, this sequel series to the 1987-95 series is even worse than the original, it's pathetic, the story lines make no sense, the acting is over the top, the writing looks lost and the acting is terrible throughout, Candace Cameron bure looks too beautiful, too sophisticated and a little too old to reprise her role as DJ Tanner, a woman who has lost her husband and she has her sister and her best friend to take care of her and her three annoying kids, the only good thing about this dreadful show is the steve and dj love story, otherwise that is it, this is really bad TV show that will never work.

I Gave it a D- one of the worst TV of the year."
Fuller House,My comfort show,"I didn't grew up watching the original show but did grow up watching this so keep that in mind. This show is not meant to be some fantastic life changing series so don't expect that. I would say it's for older kids than 7 yr more like 10 and up. Sure it has some cringe moments, but I think it's funny. I personally liked the last season the most because it had so many happy moments and the acting was great. This is my comfort show to watch when I feel anxious or I'm just bored. I think the series are more enjoyable to a person who hasn't watched the original series cause based on the reviews people who had seen the original haven't liked this. All together this show was fun and entertaining I hope they will do a series dedicated to the children when they grow up."

Alias Grace,A Powerful Novel Brought to Life,Comentario no disponible
Alias Grace,Thoughtful and Deliberate Storytelling,"I found this to be a beautifully told, riveting story. It is certainly a slow burn so if you require fast-passed action this may not be what you are looking for.

Alias Grace is an example of thoughtful and deliberate storytelling. It presents the life experiences of Grace Marks (Sarah Gadon) as she shares her story with Dr Simon Jordan. Throughout the six-part miniseries, you are meant to consider whether she is culpable for the murders for which she was accused. Sarah Gadon gives a powerful, understated performance that draws you in. Her nuanced portrayal made me more interested in watching the development of her character than learning whether she had committed the murders.

I have read some reviews in which Alias Grace was criticized for being feminist propaganda which presented the male characters as predatory and the society in which Grace lived as patriarchal. I certainly agree that the series provided commentary on sexism and classism. But I think one should keep in mind that it's a historical piece set largely in 1840-1850.

A little history of Ontario, Canada: * In 1884, married women received the same legal rights as men to enter into legal agreements and buy property. * In 1917, women were granted the right to vote. * In 1928, the Supreme Court determined that the term ""persons"" in the British North America Act did not include women. This was appealed in 1929 and women became people under the act.

So ... Personally, I'm quite comfortable with the series' commentary on sexism and the presentation of the experiences of the female characters. If you aren't considered a person under the law, naturally it will reflect how you are treated in society."
Alias Grace,Gripping.,"The main actress was superb in this gripping drama. It was so good, I watched all the episodes back to back. (all in one night) A very entertaining mystery, thriller, did she do it? who knows.

Since it was based on truth, from 1843 the research on this must have been difficult."
Alias Grace,Superbly made true crime story and Sarah Gadon is luminous,"What a well made, superbly acted and completely fascinating series this turned out to be. A true life murder is always interesting but the details here are not too well known like Lizzie Borden's story. An Irish maid emigrates to Canada but gets caught up and convicted of the murder of her employer and housekeeper. The psychological and emotional insights are so well incorporated they ring true. The dialog is such that you listen for every word though some of the accents are a bit thick.

Acting is superb. Sarah Gadon is luminous and perfectly cast. Deserves an Emmy. Her facial expressions are just right for the complexities of the role. Anna Paquin is good too in a difficult role. Zachary Levi is kind and surprisingly not out of place in the time period. The supporting cast are good too.

The directing is precise and shows you what you need for the story. The horrific and painful parts of the story are such that it could not have been shown in such detail if it was adapted many years ago. What a perfect balance of beauty and horror.

The series is 6 episodes. Just the right length - neither too long to have any draggy moments or too short to feel short changed in any way. This series shows CBC more than matching the best BBC can produce."
Alias Grace,Truly Excellent Period Piece Filled With Human Drama & Intrigue,"""Alias Grace"" is a show that, normally, would not necessarily come across my radar as something to watch. I started it after a recommendation from a family member, who very interestingly told me ""it looks like a period piece, but it's done very well"". That was telling to me. Often, when one thinks of ""period piece"", they think of stuffy dramas that look old and outdated even when they are new. A few really rise to the surface (""John Adams"" a while back comes to mind), but many just reside in that ""muddy middle"". Fortunately, ""Alias Grace"" is a period piece done absolutely perfectly, as it creates and advances great characters, is at the same time a commentary on more contemporary times, and features writing/acting that is top notch.

For a basic plot outline, ""Alias Grace"" follows the story of Grace Marks (Sarah Gadon), who is held in prison for the charged murder of Nancy Montgomery (Anna Paquin). A psychologist, Dr. Jordan (Edward Holcroft), takes an interest in her case, and decides to interview her to determine if her conviction is legitimate or based on faulty confessions/evidence. Through these interviews, Grace reflects back on much of her past, filling in the backstory until getting to the day of the murder itself.

The main reason ""Alias Grace"" works so well is because it is just an incredibly written show. What's funny is that the main conceit (Grace being interviewed by Dr. Jordan) might lead one to think that this was a ""nuthouse"" or prison-centric type of show. While perhaps nominally the guiding path for the show, the real ""meat"" comes in the story of Grace's life and the events that happen to her over the course of a lifetime, really. Using Margaret Atwood's text, the filmmakers here really paint a visceral picture of what life likely consisted of for women (and men) of that time period. As I said previously, period pieces often have the tendency to ""soften around the edges"" a bit, but ""Alias Grace"" pulls no punches. It can be happy and cheerful, but also disturbing and dour.

Another highlight is Gadon's performance as Grace, which is probably award-worthy. While the auxiliary characters are great too, this is Gadon's show to carry, and carry it she does! One can't help but get swept away in her saga, as she displays such a wide range of emotions and actions from beginning to end.

I won't spoil any details here, but let me just say this: For the first five episodes, ""Alias Grace"" is an 8-star, ""very good"" type of show. The final (sixth) episode vaults it into 10/10 ""excellent"" status. That finale is one of the best single episodes of television I've seen since ""The Leftovers"" left the airwaves. It literally had me on the edge of my seat, with my jaw ajar when the final credits rolled.

Final verdict: Another step in the right direction (and a big one!) for Netflix Original programming, on the heels of ""Mindhunter"" and ""Stranger Things S2"". Netflix has show in the past year that it can ""play with the big boys"" when it comes to original programming, and that's a net win for appreciators of quality scripted television as well."
Alias Grace,Pains me to give this a 6.,"Very well written and brilliantly acted. Sarah Gadon is amazing. The story was told in an interesting way, and Grace's journey made me uncomfortable and tense quite often. That is until the last couple of episodes. All tension went away, things all of sudden appear rushed/forced, especially the last episode.

Could have been a 10/10. Worth watching though."
Alias Grace,Absorbing and thoughtful adaptation of the feminist classic novel,Comentario no disponible
Alias Grace,Great storytelling but disappointing end,"The series is great until the very end, when they rushed it and pretty much ruined everything by leaving no satisfactory conclusion nor resolution. I loved the main character, she makes such a great psycho on moments with her comments. Her storytelling is compelling, like Scheherazade she's buying her time seducing the listener. Pity the ending was not a bit more meaningful."
Alias Grace,An Amazing Story with An Amazing Cast,"I found this wonderful series by accident on Netflix. When I saw that Sarah Gadon was staring in it I knew I had to watch it. I have loved watching her movies since I saw her in Cosmopolis. When I saw the great director David Cronenberg was acting in it too. I knew I had to watch. I was not disappointed.

The story was very compelling and kept my interested through out the series. I have to say I would recommend this to anyone that like a crime, historical, or mystery type movie."

Alias Grace,Many good things until the end,"There are many good things about this, especially in the first half. The characters are well played. In the end, however, I was unsatisfied. It was as if there was a rush to be done with it all. Not a lot of depth in the last couple of episodes."
Alias Grace,Great show!,Comentario no disponible
Alias Grace,Amazing Grace,"Very much like in her ""Handmaid's Tale"" Margaret Atwood's heroin Grace is an intelligent low class woman that know better what she should say or not for the sack of her survival. Truth is given in small doses, and with lots of compassion poured in to the naive Dr's ears .He who is so eager to help yet so blind to the exploitation and abuse of working class woman.

Grace inner voice is strong and true. Also she has no control over her life, she is not broken. I often think that is the greatest sin of woman of her kind in the eyes of society."
Alias Grace,Loved all but the last episode,"The last episode ruined it for me - I loved the series otherwise - and it made me regret having wasted time watching it. I don't mind when a series leaves you guessing at the end - Sopranos for example. But this ending was so confusing, in so many respects. The doctor banging the landlady (on the hard floor, both fully clothed) and then horribly insulting her immediately upon conclusion - what did that have to do with anything, and what was the point. (I didn't mark this as a spoiler, because, as I said, it had nothing to do with anything.) And several other similar idiotic incidents which I won't cite, to avoid spoining."
Alias Grace,A great novel makes an excellent mini-series,Comentario no disponible
Alias Grace,"Good, but I wanted it to be better....","Great atmospheric period piece. I stuck with all of the episodes, though it was a little slow at times in the middle section. Exploring women during the 1800s - what it means to be feminine, what constitutes mental illness, how a female may (or may not have) committed a murder and why - those are all very interesting topics. The series spends a lot of time in the psychology of it with conversations between Grace and the doctor charged with deciding if she's still a danger to society. But because Grace has reasons to hold back her feelings and memories, she's a bit of an unreliable narrator, and I do find that hard to feel things for a main character who may or may not be telling the truth, because you don't know what's genuine and what's not."
Alias Grace,Underrated,Very underrated mini series Should be more than 8.5
Alias Grace,"Wait for it, wait for it. Oh wait, nothing's going to happen.","I am somewhat sate of all these flashy trailers that leave me breathing air through my mouth and then i realize i've fallen for the same old marketing trick.

Like many others that probably watched this show, i myself have not read the book, nor do i intend to because it just leaves me questioning so many different aspects of this book/show that i never thought i would be questioning.

What i expected was a psychologically disturbed pathological liar that got away with killing and manipulating more than five people in her favor, what i got was a bible study of the feminist mind and her hot 50 year old master. He is hot, stop denying it.

The last two episodes should or could have been so much more but they never culminated for me it just went up, up and then down down and flatlined.

I have the feeling we are probably missing a lot of backstory. Nevertheless i think the show was good...maybe. Let's leave it to god shall we?"
Alias Grace,"Well made, but dull and uninspired.","Most of the seven stars I've given this are for the excellent period detail, cinematography, and production design, which helped keep me watching when the endless scenes of sewing started to become wearisome.

This piece is slow-moving. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, if the dialogue is top-notch and the directing assured. Here, unfortunately, we are treated to scene after scene of two people sitting in a room while one talks (and sews, and sews, and sews) and the other listens. This gives way to a voice-over which narrates the central storyline in the form of flashbacks - an uninspired device which also tests ones patience after a while.

If the story was gripping, or at least told with more inspired directing, it would be a rewarding experience, as it is certainly very well made. Unfortunately, each flashback lasts just long enough to begin to arouse one's interest before lurching awkwardly back to the talking and the sewing - effectively destroying any build-up of tension.

Sadly, one thing that seriously challenged my ability to become immersed was the casting of Anna Paquin, whose facial gurning and increasing resemblance to Val Kilmer (as both their faces grow ever wider) was distracting, and her ill-fitting presence made the whole thing feel consciously like a TV show. Overall it's worth a watch, but could be so much better with more inspired writing and directing."
Alias Grace,When women's rights or feminism is approached correctly,"This series turned out to be a real surprise for me. I had expected to get bored. However, it was definitely a valuable piece with strong script elements and subtext, meticulously woven plot, engaging the audience, making them think.

Although the series may appear to be a crime thriller, mystery, and detective story, it's anything but. These are merely costumes and masks worn by the true narrative.

In one way or another, there isn't a single woman in the series who is completely happy and peaceful. They all experience some form of oppression or persecution from men and society. I believe that feminism and the empowerment of women are often misunderstood and diluted in today's society. In my opinion, the true essence of feminism should be to understand exactly what women are up against, what they experience, and what they have had to normalize.

Alongside that, the second most powerful aspect of the narrative is its focus on reality and interpersonal dynamics. In fact, the series is essentially about two people talking, one narrating her story, and both reflecting upon it. While watching, you can't simply accept anything said at face value; you're constantly compelled to question the purpose behind it.

Besides the storyline, the performances, stage designs, and ambiance of the era are, in my opinion, already topics that don't even need further discussion. In these aspects as well, I believe no viewer would have any complaints."

Alias Grace,wonderful so far,"although they've much improved, i always was a bit disappointed in Canadian productions but this is first class...from my humble perspective...i'm impressed with it's sophistication and intelligence...lots of soul.... cheers to the actors and those built into the foundation of this lovely tapestry.....go Canada..........now please don't tell me it's really an American production :):)"
The UnXplained,"Nothing new (mostly), but far more adroitly executed than most.","Shows about the unexplained have been a dime-a-dozen. But this incarnation delivers the facts with just enough fluff to make it interesting, without crossing the line into hyperbole and sensationalism. Often the segments feel TOO short and that it moved on TOO quickly. Laudable restraint by the producers/directors.

Even Shatner is restrained. Another reviewer describes his performance as ""tired"". I find him wonderfully low-key, which is a refreshing departure from the type of hype typical hosts try to inject into topics that, while interesting, aren't really as jaw-dropping as they pretend them to be. ""Tired""? I can only wish I'll be as ""tired"" at 88.

At the end of the day, would I watch more? You bet! Keep 'em coming."
The UnXplained,Dont take it seriously,"Judging by 2 different episodes, they approach each ""mystery"" in a supernatural/conspiratorial way and not in a what actual happened way.

Lost interest after realizing that."
The UnXplained,"A standard and cliche show about the unexplained made watchable by Shatner's narration, crisp camerawork, and solid production value.","We've seen about 30 of these same shows before about unexplained phenomena, but many are very cheesy with subpar presentation and production value. History channel manages to create a decently captivating yet cliche show that rises above most unexplained type shows due to excellent production execution. The narration by Shatner is a comforting aspect and is the foundation of the show. The subject matter is interesting enough and elevated by expert photography and well selected atmospheric settings. With 2 episodes so far I want to see what else they focus this season which is something I can't say about 90% of paranormal unexplained shows. It's all about the presentation."
The UnXplained,It's Entertaining and It's Shatner. Don't Expect Real Mysteries Though.,"I just found this show online and have watched season one and heading into season 2. To start with, I watch it because Shatner is entertaining and the show entertains me. Beyond that, they're rehashed stories and, more often than not, they've already been solved (Google a few of these 'mysteries' and you'll see). That being said, I enjoy seeing and hearing the story being told by Shatner. He has a voice and way of telling mundane stories that make them enjoyable. Honestly, I think he could keep us entertained doing a show about watching paint dry. He's just that good at it. If you're a fan of his, you'll probably like the show. If you're not, you probably won't."
The UnXplained,New to this show,Just started watching recently - I like what I've seen so far. More of the same of what's been done before. I'll watch anything with Shatner in it though to be honest.
The UnXplained,Makes for very interesting viewing and the series delivers an intriguing presentation style,"Please do not pay attention to some of the negative reviews as this series has a lot to offer its viewers. William Shatner may be long in the tooth (age 89) but his delivery is as smooth as a good scotch, and the production value of each short story are always top notch. I especially enjoyed season 2, episode 9, ""The Greatest Escapes"" which was delivered not as a series of documented facts, but merely speculative on the part of William Shatner which had me (for one viewer) wondering what the real story is, and what actually happened? Shatner discussed the escapes underwater of the Great Harry Houdini, as well as the escape of three convicts who disappeared off of Alcatraz island never to be seen again (which to this day are still unexplained, thus the series title).

If you enjoy real life mysteries, which can lead a family into robust conversations and various opinions, then The UnXplained is a must see.

I give this series a highly rated 8 out 10 IMDB rating."
The UnXplained,Good fun,"Actually most of the phenomena, artifacts and mysteries in this series CAN be explained, but it's still good fun to listen to Shatner's faux awe and excitement as he explains them. (Remember, he's the guy who thought it was a good idea to recite the lyrics to ""Rocketman"" while chain smoking on a variety show.) The episodes are interesting, and the research is good, but there really is nothing astonishing about them.

Give it a look, because you won't regret it."
The UnXplained,A Step in the Right Direction from Ancient Aliens and Worthwhile For William Shatner,"At one level, The UnXplained goes over stock supernatural investigation ground that has been seen many times before (in addition to tapping into X Files nostalgia), but William Shatner's wonderfully dramatic and foreboding introductions and narration make the show very enjoyable. More importantly, while the series includes some commentators who have appeared on Ancient Aliens, it is refreshing to see that The UnXplained also features (very plausible) counter arguments based upon scientific rationales to explain away the ghosts, evil forces, Dyatlov Pass creatures, native American burial ground curse theories, bendy trees, angelic carpenters, or the Knights Templar. And so, in addition to the marvellous presence and tones of the iconic William Shatner, we also have a more balanced approach from the History Channel that does not just uncritically espouse the otherworldly and the arcane. Now that is bordering on an uneXplainable mystery."
The UnXplained,Watchable But Not Ideal,"This program follows in the footsteps of Shatner's ""Weird or What"" series with much of the same content and themes. I watched the episode dealing with viruses and only parts of 2 others, so be aware of that when reading this review.

The virus episode stated some very valuable and good information but on at least two occasions, it veered into the 'paranormal' nonsense and that really turned me off. What's different about this show (as opposed to say ""Ancient Aliens"") is that while they mention unexplained incidents, they do not lend any credence to them necessarily.

I thought they did a good job of explaining the history of viruses and plagues and the origin of vaccines, though they could have gone much more in depth.

In summary, the fact that I watched it beginning to end is a good indication that this is not a show that focuses on paranormal subjects and that is a good thing. I could easily be a much better and more worthwhile program but as it is, it's tolerable and I did enjoy parts of it. 7/10 for me."
The UnXplained,Entertaining,Anything with William Shatner has to be entertaining! Some of the shows documentary info was the same stuff we've seen on Josh Gates shows and whether its truth or fiction its fun to watch and Bill has the best voice to narrate any show
The UnXplained,Embarrassing & Ridiculous . . . .,"First off, I'm not the scientific type who screams pseudoscience whenever something paranormal is mentioned. Just the opposite. I'm highly interested in metaphysical topics and have read hundreds of metaphysical books. That's why I had to stop watching this series after watching parts of two episodes. This is an embarrassing and ridiculous show. It takes events that are normal type of events and immediately makes them paranormal.

For example, there is a story about a family owned park opened for decades, closing in the 1960s, where six children died over the years. One unsupervised child, dropped off by his mother, drowned in a pool after being sucked up to a pool pump. Another was involved in a ride/vehicle accident. The other four deaths are not described, probably because they were also typical type deaths at a small park where safety precautions were limited, especially during the years such a park existed.

But, hey, years later they found artifacts from a Native American burial ground on the property! That must mean the deaths of those six children were supernatural in nature, not explainable childhood accident deaths! Hence, this series is strictly for extremely gullible viewers, or those who only want to hear something or everything is paranormal. At least William Shatner came across well. Not being a fan of his, I expected the worst with him being the host. It was just the opposite, though. He was a perfectly fine host with a nice voice."
The UnXplained,Good ol Shatner,"You've probably already heard or watched shows about the stuff that's in this show but it has good production value, they make it spooky and mysterious and Shatner always makes me laugh XD I'm glad they got him a chair, poor old guy lol."
The UnXplained,A good little show boosted by Shatner,"The show is ok , nothing new but nevertheless entertaining , seen all the shows so far and it's william Shatners creepy stern voice with robotic actions just engros you in to the show and make you smile , he is just like santa !"

The UnXplained,Heir Apparent To Unsolved Mysteries?,"While the latest iteration of Unsolved Mysteries may have some of the DNA of the original it's so re-vamped it seems like a wholly different show. Here we have William Shatner as host/narrator and he's a good later-day Robert Stack bedrock from which, like Unsolved Mysteries, guides the viewer through a wide variety of mysterious and strange stories. More of the usual current crop of talking heads, some unique story specific experiencers, and, perhaps, fewer criminals make up the average episode. Still, it seems like the best current heir-apparent to the original beloved Unsolved Mysteries. A more serious and restrained Shatner and good production values (i.e. Tight editing reeling in the hovering paranormal aspect) make the show fairly interesting and entertaining."
The UnXplained,Had me watching back to back episodes. Planning on catching more.,"Came across this while trying to find something interesting (now that's subjective). I watched enough to see William Shatner narrating the mysteries and then remained tuned in. This just seems to be right up his alley. For me he's a natural and perfect fit. Like another reviewer said, he bumps the rating up. I also don't believe he'd be a part of a series if it weren't done quite well and it is. They cover a number of angles. I appreciate that they don't try to sensationalize the unexplained or push me to think a certain way. Makes me feel like they know their audience and they respect our ability to think for ourselves. The network had the show run back to back episodes New Year's eve day and I never changed the channel. I hope they create many more. The stories and Shatner have me hooked. He also makes me laugh. Something about him hanging on his final line. Like what more does he really want to say? Then I picture him popping a cigar in that open mouth of his."
The UnXplained,Andrew Collins has got to go!,"I really enjoy this exciting and very informative show. Their coverage of ancient sites, prehistoric ruins and exotic locales is always fascinating and enlightening - EXCEPT for the commentary of Andrew Collins. I find his accent very, very annoying, distracting and possibly pretentious. This is true to the point where I sometimes have a difficult time even understanding what it is he is trying to say! William Shatner, Lynn Picknett , Travis Taylor, Rabbi Ariel Bar Tzadok, Nick pope, Paul Bahn and all of the other commentators are excellent and add a great deal to this excellent program, but Andrew Collins has got to go!"
The UnXplained,Exceptionally crafted,"Nothing new. . .however, the feel of the show and the manner in which the various presentations are delivered is done in captivating and intriguing methodologies."
The UnXplained,Shatner needs a proofreader,"Some interesting stories but most aren't unexplained. The experts are quite knowledgeable, unlike some other programmes. Someone please tell the man the proper definition of ""irony"". And FFS Shatner it's try TO find out, not try AND find out."
The UnXplained,The powers of the unknown,"I absolutely love this show. I'd watch it while getting ready for the day, its such an easy watch. You can just listen while doing other things at the same time.

As a person who loves to know things this show really hit the spot. Its so educational and I actually learnt things that I never even knew about (like the supernova asteroid). There wasn't a single episode I didn't find interesting and I'm a little gutted I've watched all that's available. I do hope they plan on making more.

I didn't quite get why William Shatner was the host but the more I watched the more I realised his voice fits perfect with being a narrator."
The UnXplained,The secret to this show is...,"Imagine a dark room with a pensive reviewer typing away. Does she have the answers? Will we ever know? Or, is the truth so incredible that it cannot even be stated for fear of personal sanity?

Are you sure you really want to know the mysterious answers to all the questions about this show? The truth may not set you free, but haunt you forever. Can any answers ever quench human curiousity? It is more paradoxical than the Arabian Nights.

Can you accept and surrender to reality, under the immense weight of your preconceptions and hope for information? For there is only one answer ever presented in 53 episodes -- UnXplained."
The UnXplained,Amazing,"The UnXplained with William Shatner"" is an exceptional series that delves into some of the world's most intriguing and mysterious phenomena. What sets this show apart is not just the fascinating subjects it covers but the charismatic presence of William Shatner. His iconic voice and engaging narration elevate each episode, turning them into captivating explorations of the unknown. Shatner's delivery brings a unique blend of authority, curiosity, and dramatic flair, making every topic-from ancient myths and supernatural occurrences to unsolved scientific mysteries-feel personal and compelling.

One of the standout episodes for me was the one about Satan. It dives deep into the origins and evolution of one of history's most feared figures, exploring how the idea of evil has shaped human culture and belief systems. Shatner's storytelling in this episode is particularly gripping; he balances historical facts, religious insights, and a touch of psychological exploration, all while keeping you on the edge of your seat. The way he asks probing questions makes you think long after the episode is over.

Overall, ""The UnXplained"" is more than just a documentary series; it's a thought-provoking journey guided by one of entertainment's most iconic figures. Whether you're a fan of Shatner or simply love delving into life's biggest mysteries, this show is a must-watch. It's the perfect blend of intrigue, education, and entertainment, and Shatner's presence makes it all the more unforgettable."
The UnXplained,Thought provoking junk food for the mind.,"I mean exactly what I said in the title, but in the most positive ways. I should have said comfort food, for the mind but I find this one more catchy.

It's so cool to see Shatner still doing something that interests him, it shows. I've seen them on talk shows, watched him do speeches about Star Trek and he had no love for the show, he was so bored of it. When he's talking about things that he's interested in and not just things to pay the bills you won't find a better host.

The subject matter of the show may seem inconsequential and irrelevant but if it's the kind of thing that interests you, this quote-unquote pseudoscience maybe of the most important nature.. I've never been bored watching The unexplained and I'd recommend it to anybody who has half an hour to kill and wants to watch something different, thought provoking and certainly interesting."

Taj Mahal 1989,Nostalgic!,"What a nice beautiful show! Brings back the memories of 90s. The portrays a time when people things aren't as straightforward as now, and the language of love is mostly spoken by eyes than words, even though the protagonists (especially the college students) are very hep and forward thinking. Loved the story of Sarita and Akhtar and Akhtar's friendship with Sudhakar. The show is at just the pace it is supposed to be. Exactly how it was in the 90s. Slow and steady. Brilliantly done Netflix!"
Taj Mahal 1989,Nostalgic,Well written & directed Love the cinematography & ERA of 1989. Poetic & meaning of love is so well executed.
Taj Mahal 1989,Tries too hard,"The series tries too hard to 'be cool'. It depicts 1989 but tries to be post-modern in its attitude. That just doesn't feel right. There are some excellent actors in Kabi and Kulkarni, but could have been handled better by more self-assured creative leadership."
Taj Mahal 1989,Created account to write Review for this Series,"This was just awesome! the amount of research in the content of the show was amazing. The amount of details on the characters specially the friend of the professor.

It was a treat to watch this series!"
Taj Mahal 1989,Fantastic,"I loved this show. Even though I'm just an average white guy and missed many of the cultural references, the themes of the show and the relationships were universal. I found the relationship between uncle and Mumtaz to be especially touching. Would recommend for anyone who is looking for an original, thoughtful show."
Taj Mahal 1989,"At times the old-world charm works, occasionally the show seems dated!","This show works primarily for its simplicity. Ironically enough, at times its unpretentious flavour seems so unembellished, without the usual ingredients of contemporary web-series (like thrill, drama, hook points, etc) that it seems a minimalist recipe dished out from Doordarshan days. And between it's old-world charm and occasionally dated demeanor, this feel-good piece finds a space of its own.

The title 'Taj Mahal 1989' might seem misleading as the monument of love finds reference only in the last episode. The story is largely set in Lucknow (7 hours away from Taj Mahal) and is predominantly about 3 individual tracks that loosely connect at some point in the series. The first is about a couple (Neeraj Kabi-Geetanjali Kulkarni) having regular couple compatibility issues which escalates towards a divorce consideration. The second is about a man who has a live-in relationship with an erstwhile sex-worker (Sheeba Chaddha - Danish Husain). The third is about friends turning foes over campus politics and some love tracks in between (a subplot largely dealt in Mirzapur). None of the stories are path-breaking in nature. Still with an easygoing feel-good charm, each one passes off.

The setting is in the year 1989. However the period is touched only marginally and the retro era does not add any element or character of its own (like say a show like 'Yeh Meri Family'). The plots however are relatable even today.

The major issue with the show is that it takes a little too long to come to its point. For the first 3 episodes, the characters are just getting established and the storytelling is so scattered that you aren't sure who are you following or rooting for in the show. Also most episodes do not end on any cliffhangers. So chances are if you aren't patient enough, you might leave the show in between. The new trend of just 25-30 minute episode runtime gives some respite.

Performances is one department where even the average shows today do not disappoint. Even this one boasts of convincing acts. Veteran actors like Neeraj Kabi, Sheeba Chaddha and Marathi actress Geetanjali Kulkarni do a commendable job. From the newer lot Anud Singh Dhaka is particularly impressive. He has a Ranveer Singh hangover in his looks and performance but has good scene presence from the start though he gets more scope only eventually. He gets to play one of the most righteous roles that an actor might have played off late when everyone usually have shades of grey to them. The female cast of Anshul Chauhan and Shirin Sewani are charming and confident.

'Taj Mahal 1989' is a show that evokes mixed emotions from you. At moments you like it, at moments you feel there's nothing special. You won't regret watching it. But it isn't a must-watch either."
Taj Mahal 1989,one of the best shows .excellent story,Awesome plot and story. looks like its golden age of television in india
Taj Mahal 1989,Don't miss it!,"It's a very well made show with excellent acting by one and all. Even the young actors Anud sing and Anshul Chauhan have acted very well. Without the use of excessive foul language, violence or sex, unlike most web series these days, Tajmahal 1989 is very refreshing. Thanks to the team!"
Taj Mahal 1989,Realistic Pure depiction of love.,Some excellent realistic performances. Loved it. Depicting love in a very elegant manner.
Taj Mahal 1989,Quite an okay Indian TV Show,"People always have negative thought about Indian drama, which includes me as well. But this one is quite new to me. It's cinematography is so good compared to typical Indian drama we've seen a lot in memes. The story line is quite good, every character are linked in some ways and I really like when they talked about philosophy. Not that deep but it felt good when something informative are mentioned. Everything seems natural and realistic like nowadays series that we found normally in Netflix. (Typical new wave) So it is a recommended one, nice to binge."
Taj Mahal 1989,Realistic,Well written and very well acted. Such an accurate recreation of an era gone by. Probably the best Netflix Indian show till now.
Taj Mahal 1989,Simple Sweet Remind of Old Time,This series is simple sweet series contain lots of drama...This series is totally different from today kind of web series...The best part of series is it teach us not to judge anyone according to their past.
Taj Mahal 1989,Showing cream rolls doesn't recreate 1989,"The series claims to be of 1989, but it got everything wrong. They recreated some period pieces like karamchand to bring upon a nostalgic feeling, but make no mistake, this is absolute trash.

Here characters hug in cafes, youth are shown to be okay with pre-marital sex, cakes in bakeries look like cakes from today, people are celebrating Valentine's Day in 1989!! They just got NOTHING right.

The female college goer talks like an absolute bimbo who's interested in nothing but materialism, another wannabe cool character thinks this obsession with sex covers up for his inability to understand ""love""....and all character stupidly go on saying they don't understand what is ""love"". Like, seriously?? How crass can the makers be? Have you ever heard about something called ""characterization ""??

I don't know who from Netflix decides on these kind of shows to be brought from India, but whoever that person is, they got it very wrong to give unskilled directors and makers to make such a tacky, cringe show.

I feel like I wasted my time by watching the first episode. And of course it's tough to go beyond that."
Taj Mahal 1989,Excellent story,"The story is excellent, realistic and romanctic. Very good a acting. Thank you NETFLIX"
Taj Mahal 1989,Brilliant !,"The show portrays an era where love was not diluted by technology. Shot in Uttar Pradesh ,it gets most of the references of its time right. Even though sometimes the show might get less pacy, the little stories that try to figure out love , finally knitting up on a larger narrative makes it interesting. Everyone has their definition of love , and I must say this one by Netflix was lovely. Binge watch worthy."
Taj Mahal 1989,Splendid!,"Story of simpler times, a more tolerant society. Sets feel real, local, aligned with the 80s. Shoutout tO the director/writer for capturing the originality of Lucknow rather so well. The cast stands out too; everyone performs to the best of their abilities. However, the work of the ensemble cast from the older generation showcased more finesse (but obvious). I loved how it all culminates at last. More power to Netflix india."

Taj Mahal 1989,"Brilliant film, great plot and superb acting","Sunio, Kahiyo, Dil Se Dilon Ki Jo Batein Hain will haunt me for a long, long, time- so the Lyricist and Amar Mangrulkar deserves my heartfelt thanks as does the gentle gaze of Will Humphries on objects, people, and the scene before him. The casting was impeccable - I am sure Paras Priyadarshan wud be grateful for attaining escape velocity from his Fogg Ads! There are several nuggets too that were so endearing be it the play on ""cope"" or even the supercomic ""Akhilesh Tendon"" - not to speak of ""Taiyan"".

The conversations on philosophy are so deceptive and filled in like ""throwaways"" in keeping with the languid pace of the series (although it picked up pace near its conclusion) but also so profound as one muses on them. Brilliant. Anshul Chauhan says in the end that you dont find love when you look for it - her sweet disposition so convincingly worn may perhaps obviate the need for her to search hard for new roles. I kept thinking that probably it is the first time Danish Hussein played ""against type"".

Overall, I felt so good in this excursion of Taj Mahal. Hope there is more from the Flying Saucer stable!

Congratulations, Taj Mahal team!"
Taj Mahal 1989,Can't recreate 1989 correctly,"The show claims to be the story of 1989 but lacks realism bigtime. Trains didn't have green coloured coaches in 1989. Agra station didn't have their names written in black on a perfectly yellow background. Trees weren't painted red and white back then. Books available in India didn't have barcodes back then.

If you are making a show claiming it to be from 1989, pay attention to detail."
Taj Mahal 1989,Simple drama acted best,"Simple straight forward story telling. Explores love in different age, change between old school and new, love beyond physical relation...goes on and on. I wouldn't not say it is the most perfect drama, but certainly watchable."
Taj Mahal 1989,Wonderful,"Beautifully written and directed, superb acting full entertainment"
Taj Mahal 1989,"NO fairytales, ordinary happiness authentic storyline.","Each character played fabulously good, hoping to see more."
Taj Mahal 1989,"Tajmahal is forever, and so is Tajmahal 1989",Fabulous! Out of this world! Thanks Pushpendra ji! Splendid performances by one and all! But most noteworthy in my opinion (in the same order as given) are:- Danish Husain Sheeba Chaddha Neeraj Kabi Geetanjali Kulkarni Anud Singh Dhaka & Anshul
Taj Mahal 1989,Sweet & Simple,This is such a beautiful way of portraying love. Pure & simple...
Taj Mahal 1989,Totally irrelevant times ..,It can't be telling the story of 1989... I just couldn't watch past 2 nd episode.. I loved yeh mera ghar.. but this one is unbearable.. I'm an avid TV watcher...
Surviving R. Kelly,Nostalgic!,"What a nice beautiful show! Brings back the memories of 90s. The portrays a time when people things aren't as straightforward as now, and the language of love is mostly spoken by eyes than words, even though the protagonists (especially the college students) are very hep and forward thinking. Loved the story of Sarita and Akhtar and Akhtar's friendship with Sudhakar. The show is at just the pace it is supposed to be. Exactly how it was in the 90s. Slow and steady. Brilliantly done Netflix!"
Surviving R. Kelly,Nostalgic,Well written & directed Love the cinematography & ERA of 1989. Poetic & meaning of love is so well executed.
Surviving R. Kelly,Tries too hard,"The series tries too hard to 'be cool'. It depicts 1989 but tries to be post-modern in its attitude. That just doesn't feel right. There are some excellent actors in Kabi and Kulkarni, but could have been handled better by more self-assured creative leadership."
Surviving R. Kelly,Created account to write Review for this Series,"This was just awesome! the amount of research in the content of the show was amazing. The amount of details on the characters specially the friend of the professor.

It was a treat to watch this series!"
Surviving R. Kelly,Fantastic,"I loved this show. Even though I'm just an average white guy and missed many of the cultural references, the themes of the show and the relationships were universal. I found the relationship between uncle and Mumtaz to be especially touching. Would recommend for anyone who is looking for an original, thoughtful show."
Surviving R. Kelly,"At times the old-world charm works, occasionally the show seems dated!","This show works primarily for its simplicity. Ironically enough, at times its unpretentious flavour seems so unembellished, without the usual ingredients of contemporary web-series (like thrill, drama, hook points, etc) that it seems a minimalist recipe dished out from Doordarshan days. And between it's old-world charm and occasionally dated demeanor, this feel-good piece finds a space of its own.

The title 'Taj Mahal 1989' might seem misleading as the monument of love finds reference only in the last episode. The story is largely set in Lucknow (7 hours away from Taj Mahal) and is predominantly about 3 individual tracks that loosely connect at some point in the series. The first is about a couple (Neeraj Kabi-Geetanjali Kulkarni) having regular couple compatibility issues which escalates towards a divorce consideration. The second is about a man who has a live-in relationship with an erstwhile sex-worker (Sheeba Chaddha - Danish Husain). The third is about friends turning foes over campus politics and some love tracks in between (a subplot largely dealt in Mirzapur). None of the stories are path-breaking in nature. Still with an easygoing feel-good charm, each one passes off.

The setting is in the year 1989. However the period is touched only marginally and the retro era does not add any element or character of its own (like say a show like 'Yeh Meri Family'). The plots however are relatable even today.

The major issue with the show is that it takes a little too long to come to its point. For the first 3 episodes, the characters are just getting established and the storytelling is so scattered that you aren't sure who are you following or rooting for in the show. Also most episodes do not end on any cliffhangers. So chances are if you aren't patient enough, you might leave the show in between. The new trend of just 25-30 minute episode runtime gives some respite.

Performances is one department where even the average shows today do not disappoint. Even this one boasts of convincing acts. Veteran actors like Neeraj Kabi, Sheeba Chaddha and Marathi actress Geetanjali Kulkarni do a commendable job. From the newer lot Anud Singh Dhaka is particularly impressive. He has a Ranveer Singh hangover in his looks and performance but has good scene presence from the start though he gets more scope only eventually. He gets to play one of the most righteous roles that an actor might have played off late when everyone usually have shades of grey to them. The female cast of Anshul Chauhan and Shirin Sewani are charming and confident.

'Taj Mahal 1989' is a show that evokes mixed emotions from you. At moments you like it, at moments you feel there's nothing special. You won't regret watching it. But it isn't a must-watch either."
Surviving R. Kelly,one of the best shows .excellent story,Awesome plot and story. looks like its golden age of television in india
Surviving R. Kelly,Don't miss it!,"It's a very well made show with excellent acting by one and all. Even the young actors Anud sing and Anshul Chauhan have acted very well. Without the use of excessive foul language, violence or sex, unlike most web series these days, Tajmahal 1989 is very refreshing. Thanks to the team!"

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,,
Nailed It!,I like it!,Idk why a lot of the comments complain about the host. She is the best part. Jacques is great too. So is Wes. Simple concept and fun.
Nailed It!,Good Natured Fun,"This show is great. Although the tasks are difficult, everyone is light hearted and silly. The participants have ups and downs but they put their best foot forward and don't give up.

The hosts are good at poking fun instead of criticizing the participants. The structure of the show is great and the second round buttons for getting help or messing with your competition keeps it good natured. There are tips to learn but that is not the point.

The guest judges are all great and the regular judges never disappoint."
Nailed It!,Wes is the best!,"I enjoy the show, it's kind of a sad funny. Like some of the professional bakers look like they are questioning why they accepted to be on this show = sad funny :) But the backstage assistant guy Wes is the best! His clever awkwardness is funny. It is a little weird when they share stuff. Like when they all took sips out of the same drink.... let's share our coodies."
Nailed It!,So Much fun!,"I've seen a lot of negative reviews of this based on complaints about the host, but I personally love her. In the world of straight-laced cooking shows, the host comes off as spunky and silly and perfectly in tune with the pastel backgrounds. She can be a bit over-the-top at times, but for the most part I find her really enjoyable, and she's an excellent foil to the more serious French chef. The more-advanced baking tips are pretty neat and make me want to try some of these highly-advanced sculpture cakes myself. The cooks who fail are hilarious, the cooks who nail are inspiring, and the judges try to keep things very positive for the most part. An uplifting, cheery, goofy show for anyone who likes baking or cooking."
Nailed It!,"Everybody having fun and stuff, Nicole is kinda annoying though","I normally use these kinds of shows as background audio but this one in particular is just a happy, feel good show that anyone can watch and have a good time and also learn about baking itself. Since it amateur bakers as the contestants of course there's going to be a moment where a contestant does something completely wrong and then realizing that you weren't supposed to do that and it's messed up now, those kinds of moments can be seen as a learning experience for the contestants and I like that. The final products come out to be close sometimes and that's a surprise, even if the judges may or may not see it being close to them. However, the main judge Nicole byre is pretty annoying and not that funny and kinda kills the show for me and I'm not saying that because I saw some reviews that said that, she is genuinely loud and not funny, maybe someone else will find her funny but it's not for me for sure."
Nailed It!,Instant Love!,"The hosts are hilarious, the rules are silly and the contestants are having a blast! I suddenly wish Nicole was the host of ALL shows, she is unconventional and fun in her approach and keeps the other judges guessing what will happen next. The upbeat atmosphere of the show is a welcome change to the catty negative vibes fostered by most reality/competition shows. Had so much fun watching season one and have my fingers crossed there will be more coming soon!"
Nailed It!,"Great show, terrible host.",I watched this all in one sitting and laughed A LOT but geez the host. What is going on here? They've got her trying wayyyy too hard. Simmer down about 5 notches and we've got a winner here.
Nailed It!,Low budget joy ride,It's fun and a little sloppy but that's what makes it so entertaining.
Nailed It!,Great show... host is extremely annoying,"Love the show, the French judge is hilarious. The host is super annoying, I don't find her funny at all; if they replaced her the show would definitely be a 10/10"
Nailed It!,The host is annoying,The show would be totally up my ally cause that's me when I bake but the host is just so damn annoying.
Nailed It!,good show,Love this show. The host is so off the wall that she drew me into the show. What is the song that they play at the end of the show?
Nailed It!,"Man, Is Byers annoying!",Comentario no disponible
Nailed It!,Stop screaming,"The idea is amazing and funny, but wtf is going on with this host? Why is she screaming all the time? It was supposed to be funny. You can be funny without screaming. Pretty sure i'm deaf now"
Nailed It!,Love love love this hilarious show!,"Everything about the show is so great. The fact that the contestants have no professional training makes it very relatable to the common person. The host is hilarious and you can tell she is funny on her own without having to read a cue card. Each episode they have a guest judge on the first one is a little old lady and she talks about how the fact that the contestants haven't bribed the judges with the vodka that Theyre using for cake pops means they're cheap and prude. Who doesn't love a grandma calling people prude for not giving her vodka LOL Even though these contestants have no idea what they are doing, I am still learning from the show, Because as they do things wrong the judges explain how to do it right and they even come up with a little advice tips on the screen throughout the show."
Nailed It!,"Love everything, except the host","The contestants, challenges and guest judges are really entertaining, but the host is so annoying. She is an over actor, loud, brash, screetchy and so far from funny that I would rather watch the news.... and that sh!£ is depressing. I can't watch it anymore because she irritates me so much.. Jacques is a cutie though"
Nailed It!,Instant fan!!!,"Holy heckaroni!!! I was in tears from the first episode, this has got to be one of my fave shows in a while! It is basically Pinterest Fails meets n00b baking show and the judges are hilariously shamelessly savage in their critiques. I pray for season 2 already!"
Nailed It!,Overall I like it but...,Comentario no disponible
Nailed It!,Binge watched it. HILARIOUS I want to be on the show!,What a great show. I laughed so hard. I love it! Just binge watched it and am sad its over. How can I be on the show!? LOL
Nailed It!,Nice show but...,"It's really interesting to watch, it's well made, but some things just don't make sense.

Why would they give ridiculously short amount of time for the second part of the competition? They participants are people with no baking experience and the time they give them is simply not enough. I'm pretty sure not even the professionals would be able to make such an exceptional cake in under 120 minutes.

Also, the host, Nicole Byer, who seems to me like a really nice and fun person, is way too loud. It's the first time I've ever seen her on the screen and all I saw at first was her yelling. All the time. Whatever she says, she screams it. She simply cannot talk. She makes the show extremely hard to watch, not only because it gets way too annoying after the first 10 min of constant shouting, but also because you can barely hear anyone else talk. If you wanna be able to make out what the others are saying, you should put the volume nearly at max, and then after a few seconds, Nicole starts shouting and the sound wave throws you against the wall. They could've edited this before releasing the show... I mean, you don't hear the other stuff in the background, like the mixers and everything else that makes noise, do you."
Nailed It!,Needs a new host,Nicole Byers is annoying and so not funny. She makes the show almost unwatchable.
Nailed It!,Hilarious,"I am a terrible baker so this show really resonates with me. I also love things that are so bad they're good, and that's exactly what a lot of the baking attempts by the contestants are. I'm fairly sure I couldn't do a better job, so credit to them all for having a go.

I love the host. She's warm, loud and joyful. She'll laugh at disaster cakes without being cruel. She seems like the kind of person I'd want in my life as a friend.

This show is dumb fun, and since I'm writing this during a COVID-imposed lockdown it's just the sweet dessert I need to stay happy and sane."
Nailed It!,Fun.,Enjoyable. I do wish they would show some of the art/craft in more detail. It would be interesting to learn.
Nailed It!,"Great Concept, horrible casting","This show is something that we have been screaming for for years, and we have it. Sadly, the host makes it virtually unwatchable. There is no chemistry between any of the judges, and there seems to be no organization or direction. This show could have been so much better if they would have aired it on Food Network and had been able to replace the broken pieces."
Nailed It!,Omg Nicole and Jacques are a match made in heaven,"Nicole and Jacques are a well paired and hilarious duo. Omg I've been binge watching this and I'm in tears laughing at their interplay and reactions to the creations of the contestants on the show. A must watch especially if you like baking cook offs, comedy, French men..."
Nailed It!,If you skip the parts where the host speaks it's fun,How the host on TV is beyond me but I like the show because this is me cooking. French is guy kinda funny. Why do Americans just bake bread and (sometimes) add butter and call it a c a k e ?

Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Not much new - just recycled material,"Don't get me wrong it was funny. Brian is funny.

But I was disappointed with this special. It's about 90% recycled material from a selection of his most classic bits. With several of them a sketch has been made to elaborate on the point of the joke. Didn't really do much for me."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Great comedy, flawed format (esp the floor producer)","Brian Regan is a legend and his stand up alone is worth watching here. But the show format is somewhat contrived and feels forced and deliberate in some parts. The audience questions are interesting enough but appear pre-arranged and coming from super fans (like me). The ""floor manager"" is completely unnecessary and too obvious as a cue for segues to segments or banal reactions. A complete distraction. Can he not host this himself? In essence, great, original comedy delivered in poorly conceived concept that adds unneeded waste and insults the viewer's intelligence."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Disappointing,"I love Brian's standup and he's great at his bits in this but the format does not work. Brian doesn't need a contrived overenthusiastic 'live/studio' audience. He's an immense talent in search of a concept and a point of difference. Greatest hits standup throwing to TV screens with sketches doesn't seem to be it. The show 'Seinfeld' successfully interspersed standup with a sitcom based on the standup. This show has Seinfeld as a producer and it is trying to intersperse standup with sketches based on the standup.

I went to check this out thinking it was a new standup special. I was intrigued to discover it was a series, then disappointed at the execution. The audience interaction and Beth banter are further unnecessary and distracting contrivances.

The standup is fine. The sketches are mostly solid. I love lap griddle and the restaurant with tables too close. But the means by which the standup and sketches are brought together is clunky. I'm sad to not be able to recommend this and, given the mass of other comedy choices to watch, won't be returning to view any future efforts should there be any."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Solid, sometimes even brilliant","I don't understand and the negative reviews here. I've liked Brian for a while. I have most of his CDs and have seen him live twice. I was prepared for disappointment with the show based on the IMDB reviews and instead found myself laughing out loud.

I give this a sold rating and recommend it!"
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Love Brian Regan - This show, not so much","If you're new to Brian's standup act, you may find this very enjoyable. Otherwise, it's a lot of recycled material. Some of the acted out bits are pretty funny, others not so much. The interaction with the ""floor manager"" and the audience seems forced overall. Was hoping for better."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Very good,This is a really good show. The switch between the stand up and the sketches is a tad awkward but it's worth it. BR is a stone cold killer. It's pretty much all winners.
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Love Brian, this show...not so much",He's my favorite. And this show does have a few moments. But overall it just misses. Whoever had the idea for the 'floor manager' should re-evaluate their creative skills. She's painful to watch and it feels like Brian is forced to talk to her. Just a painful show killer. Same with the reoccurring 'I'll fix this'. I wanted this to work so bad. Oh well.
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Brian Regan is hilarious, give it a try","Seriously, Brian Regan is hilarious! Sure it has some of his old material but it's still just as funny. His sketches are hit and miss, but always entertaining"
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Seinfeld meets Conan and Key & Peele,"Jerry Seinfeld is a producer and public promoter of the show, and it is quickly apparent that Regan appeals to a similar sense of humor. Adding a bit of color and bravado, he succeeds in modernizing the ""Why do people..?"" approach; however, this show tries to do too much.

The cutaways from live audience to sketches is reminiscent of successful comedy Key & Peele, though Regan's primary skill is in his live stand-up, not his acting, so the comedy routines dominate the show. Some of the skits featuring other people feature pretty poor acting, but this actually brings out Regan and his teams' tremendous ability to bring the routines to life. Particular actors are able to steal the show, however, and over time these figures should be used more often (think of how Key and Peele both rose to fame on MadTV).

Then there's Beth and the audience dynamic. I have no doubt Beth adds to the show and probably knows much more about producing than Brian; still, the conversations with her seem very forced. It is impossible not to think of Andy Richter on Conan, but it is possible to realize it doesn't work well here.

Overall, the experimentation with the audience will most likely work itself out, and the mix between stand-up and sketches will probably swing more towards sketches. Though this show still features more stand-up than Seinfeld ever did, the earliest Seinfeld episodes showed much more stand-up, than fully developed as David and Seinfeld improved as writers. This first season paves the way nicely for Regan, with still some things to fully figure out."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Not funny,I like Brian but this is out dated and unfunny. I mean a whole skit on turning on a landline??? And the floor manager thing and audience question is forced. He can do better.
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"New Show, Old Material, Loved It","Yes, it was some of Brian Regan's older material, however, it is basically a concept show at this point. Once it becomes established it will be even more funny than it already is. Remember, ""Seinfeld"" was almost a flop in the beginning, and this show had a very decent start."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Not Great,"Brian is hilarious but the format seems really forced. Wish Netflix gave him true standup time, not this"
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,I expected better,"Brian's comedy has never really evolved over the years, which is fine for the most part but it shows its age here. Especially since, as mentioned in other reviews, a lot of it is recycled material.

It was only 4 20(ish) minute episodes so it was pretty painless, but two days later and I really only remember one skit being funny. There were a few chuckles here and there, but hopefully they don't green light a second season."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Material too old,"I used to LOVE Brian. When i found him like 15 years ago, i thought he was a genius comic. His physical comedy augments his material PERFECTLY. I love that he works clean. I had gone to see Brian 5 or 6 times live in the northeast area over the years and as each visit happened, i noticed something that was clear. He was relying on decades old material on each successive event. And this was over a period of 10 years. He of course has people shout out from the audience to do these old bits, but i don't understand that. I almost thought it was plants in the audience to do it...even when they DONT shout out requests, he still does bits that he's done from the early 90's; a LOT. I ALWAYS give material he puts out a good shake. This show included. But unfortunately, it's been the same. To get me back, he needs to do a lot more recent material. That's my take."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Witty & Observational Magic,"Though some material is reincarnated, the addition of breakaway segments adds a new layer of comedy to the act. Comedy that is just funny, Brian has no need to shock the audience with rediculous sexual accounts or loud fowl language to get a reaction. The real to life situations and funny observations brought my wife and I to tears from all the laughing. This show is a much needed addition to the Netflix repituar."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Decent Material with Unbearable Production,"Brian Regan has been a great comic for decade, so I was happy to see him get a new opportunity, but almost everything about this show is terrible. The production is so bad that you actually think the choices made are intended to add to the comedy. Unfortunately, it's not. It's 100% serious.

The stand-up by Regan in between sketches is just regurgitated material that he did in a half hour special on Comedy Central in the late 90s. He has so much more material than that. Why is he only doing the same 20 year old jokes?

The laughter from the crowd is probably genuine, especially when Regan is doing stand-up, but they don't mute the crowd noise after cutting to sketches so it ends up sounding like a laugh track. Cringe.

The transitions into the sketches involve a ""producer"" who feigns stupid and interrupts with uncomfortably forced questions or comments related to the topics of the bits. It's so terrible and unnecessary.

The camera work in the sketches is super shaky and they make 15 cuts in a 6 second period. The stand-up segments do this as well. It's almost as if they were trying to impress you with how many cameras they have recording the show.

Even the intro to the show has ridiculously corny narration, music, and visuals. It feels like a horrible 80s tv stand-up production.

So many comics have done this formula well (stand-up to sketches) and it is not a difficult one to follow. It's almost impressive to screw it up so much.

Stop over-producing and over-editing the show. Stop using the same tired, old material. I feel bad for Brian Regan because there's no way in hell this gets another season. If you are a fan of him, do not watch this."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Brian is so funny! Just listen to his standup and avoid this.,This was so hard to watch because Brian is one of the funniest people on the planet. The editing was awkward and the stage manager thing was annoying. Most of the bits are from his standup and the punch lines didn't have the same zing without the build up of the whole set.
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Oh Brian, so talented yet so lazy","Brian Regan is the only major comedian that I know off who's hell bent on STILL recycling his jokes 20 years later, every special, every new thing he does - same tired, aggressively outdated jokes again and again...

And this one is even worse because there's an annoying, forced interaction with someone called a 'floor manager' - and it's very cringy.

Brian used to be fresh, animated and super funny in the early 2000s but wow, he hasn't tried being any of those things since. I hope for at least one more fresh special from him someday.

Write some new jokes, Brian. Even non-comedy fans who don't know you have already heard of your current jokes by now. There's recycling and there's just being lazy and disrespectful to your audience."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,Say it ain't so Brian...,"I've been a big Regan fan for years. His style of observations about the world mixed with clever jokes and his facial expressions have always had me giggling in the past. As a big stand up fan I was beyond excited to see a new Regan special. I came to find out it's actually a show. So this is great news right?

Well unfortunately I found absolutely no redeeming quality in this. I had to force myself to watch the entirety of the first episode as I wanted to turn it off after only minutes. The fact that he is rehashing his old material in itself is not such a bad thing. If done in a proper way I actually would love to see some of his crazy and zaney ideas expanded upon. The delivery of this however leaves one to wonder ""did I just watch the worst tv show / stand up special ever?"" Unfortunately I would have to say pretty darn near close.

We are practically in 2019 and I thought my days of hearing laugh tracks are over. This show does not use a laugh track, however the audience is actually worse. I actually would rather have the Full House laugh track as opposed to this audience. They actually start to laugh BEFORE the punchlines sometimes. It is extremely forced and contrived. I do not believe I am exaggerating here when I say I feel this is the most annoying audience I have ever had the displeasure of seeing/listening to. They literally laugh at everything and in the same almost ""monotone"" way. It is incredibly distracting and has to be one of the worst decisions a tv show has ever made... It's 2019 for pete's sake! This would have been outdated in the 80's!!

Then there is that producer woman (I think her name is Beth?). Her banter with Brian is once again very forced. It is so bad you get the feeling she is being forced to do this under threat of death or something because she is the most insincere ""actor"" I have ever seen. It is pretty hard to make Brian Regan unfunny but well... She's making it happen. I just wanted Brian to pull some cord and a giant bucket of slime falls on her the entire way through watching this. This person has no business doing what she is doing.

Now it wouldn't be fair to just blame her and the audience. After all Brian obviously had a large creative hand in creating this (although that is an assumption). Even if he didn't he should have enough sense to see this as a train wreck a mile away and steer clear. I sure hope he is making a pile of $ for this and that's what this is about. He's a great guy and totally deserves it and I would not lose respect if that's what he's doing. Because he sure as heck is not doing this for critical acclaim. He himself is as unfunny as I've ever seen him perform. He seems to have about as much energy as he had when he was on the Joe Rogan podcast and that is to say he had no energy. His previous stand up specials are full of energy.

This special was so bad I felt compelled to post a review online. I've never done this before and had to create an account just to do so."
Standup and Away! with Brian Regan,"Old Pro, Old Hat","This guy has been around the block a few times, so you're going to see a pretty polished act, but that's likely the problem. You want to watch this for one bit though...a fake informercial for the ""Lap Grill"", it's fantastic."

The Founder,Heartbreaking,"Really don't even know how to review this movie. Acting was superb, but content makes me sick. I give this a 1 on storyline alone. Ray Kroc was a scumbag of the highest order, in a class all his own. My heart breaks for the McDonald Brothers who were steamrolled, manipulated, and who had their livelihood utterly destroyed by this cunning, ruthless, and I'm convinced, sociopathic man. Especially with the notes at the end how they never received one dime in royalties. This story will really make you hate McDonald's."
The Founder,"A tale of treachery, greed and a code of ethics toxic enough to spoil a Big Mac.","Biographical dramas tell stories about significant people in history but they are always much more than that. The person chosen for the bio-pic reflects something about the values of the era and the society from which they came. In this sense, The Founder (2016) goes well beyond the story of a global hamburger empire to the values that made McDonald's possible and it does not paint a pretty picture. The mantra ""persistence is everything"" is heard at the beginning and the end of this film but when decoded it means persistent treachery, greed, and a code of ethics toxic enough to remove some gloss from the world's most recognised golden arches.

The real founders are brothers Maurice (John Lynch) and Richard McDonald (Nick Offerman) who pioneered the idea of standardised burgers made quickly that led to the modern fast-food industry. Into their lives came Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton), a struggling milkshake-mixer salesman who is amazed at the queues of people lined up for burgers and fries. The brothers trust Ray, tell him their secrets, and in 1954 Ray becomes the franchise manager responsible for setting up new stores. Driven by insatiable greed, Ray wants to go national but the brothers fear loss of quality control. When Ray realises that owning the property on which stores operate gives him complete control of the business, his takeover plans are rolled into place.

The storyline follows the facts of history but it is the film's characterisations that are its real achievement. Perhaps best known for his extraordinary performance in Birdman (2014) Michael Keaton is in a class of his own when it comes to portraying deeply flawed people living on the edge of sanity or evil. From the opening scenes his eyes express callous disregard for others, and at one point he boasts that if a competitor was drowning he would not hesitate to put a running hose deep down the victim's throat. His flawed humanity is contrasted by the authenticity and honesty represented by the brothers. Excellent casting, directing and period sets make this a thoroughly engaging story.

This film also arrives with remarkable timing given the current global spotlight on the home of capitalism. Millions of McDonald's fans are regularly processed by one of the most sophisticated marketing machines on the planet. Seeing The Founder is a bit like finding out that Santa Claus is Satan in disguise. Good cinema not only entertains: it shows the world as it is, not as we believe it should be. The Founder tells a story that should be told, and it does it brilliantly."
The Founder,I simultaneously respect and dislike Ray Kroc,"The Founder is a fascinating and frustrating story about a man (and a restaurant chain) that you simultaneously respect and dislike. Michael Keaton becomes Ray Kroc, and this film makes you realize how revolutionary the concept of McDonald's really was. It may have made my wife want to boycott the Golden Arches for a while, but it's still a well-made movie."
The Founder,Kroc took their lunch money,"Greetings again from the darkness. How you define success will likely determine your interpretation of this film that is every bit as much about the humble beginnings and explosive growth of McDonalds as it is a biopic of Ray Kroc, the self-professed ""founder"" of the golden arches empire. Capitalism and its corresponding businessmen have not typically been favorably portrayed by Hollywood in such films as The Social Network, Wall Street, Glengarry Glen Ross, Steve Jobs and The Wolf of Wall Street. This latest from director John Lee Hancock (Saving Mr. Banks, The Blind Side) and writer Robert Siegel (The Wrestler) is no exception, and it's obvious why.

It's 1954 when we first catch up with Ray Kroc (as played by Michael Keaton). He's the type of travelling salesman who totes around his latest widget (a multiple milkshake machine), rehearses and polishes his spiel (via extreme close-up), and listens to motivational record albums that preach the importance of persistence, while he stays at roadside motels that act as his home away from home. Kroc doggedly pursues the American dream, and optimistically bounces from one project to another  convinced that he's found ""the next big thing"".

When circumstance leads him to a crowded little octagonal burger shop in San Bernardino, Kroc becomes fascinated with its simplicity and success. Over dinner, Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald detail the Spee-Dee kitchen design and unique focus on quality, consistency and speed that today is considered the starting line of the fast-food industry. The tennis court sequence is especially creative and fun to watch. While the brothers prefer to keep the business small and remain in control, Kroc pitches his vision of franchising  a pitch with emphasis on ""Crosses. Flags. Arches"".

The full story is likely one most people don't know  despite the fact that McDonalds now feeds 1% of the world population each day (a statistic posted on screen). The relationship between Kroc and the McDonald brothers was never a smooth one, and it's a perfect example of dog-eat-dog, or unprincipled vs idealistic. Kroc sees himself as a ""winner"", while it's likely most will view his actions as unscrupulous, even if legal.

Keaton's performance accurately captures a man who is impatiently ambitious, and whose confidence and ego grow incrementally as it becomes inevitable that the decency of the brothers is actually a weakness in business. Offerman and Lynch are both excellent, and other support work is provided by Laura Dern as Kroc's first and mostly neglected wife who is tossed aside when something better comes along; BJ Novak as Harry J Sonneborn, the key to Kroc's power move; Justin Randell Brooks as Fred Turner and Kate Kneeland as June Martino, two trusted employees; and Patrick Wilson as a key franchisee. Linda Cardellini (Mad Men, Bloodline) plays Joan, Ray's wife (she was actually his third) and business adviser from 1969 until his death in 1984. The film shortchanges her importance – at least until the closing credit recap.

Bookending that opening extreme close-up sales pitch, is a near-conclusion zoom on Keaton's face as he prepares for an event where he will tell his story  at least his version of the story. The film does a really nice job of capturing the era. Of particular interest is that the cars don't look like they rolled right out of a classic car show, as happens with most movies. It's nice to see some faded paint and a dented fender on screen. The early McDonalds locations are beautifully and realistically replicated to provide a nostalgic look for some, and a first glimpse for others. Carter Burwell's score is complementary to the proceedings, and director Hancock deserves credit for not just making this the Michael Keaton/Ray Kroc show. Rather than serving up a Happy Meal movie, the film instead provides a somewhat toned-down historical view of ambition and drive, and the birth of an empire  one that changed our culture."
The Founder,Keaton shines in this fascinating biopic,"For many the thought nowadays of takeaway food is but a convenience we all enjoy (some more than others) but at one stage during human history the very idea of having your burger, fries and ice-cold Coke ready in mere seconds was a novelty that began sweeping the nation of America before taking over the world as we now know it today.

A staple for over 60 years, McDonalds restaurants are a mainstay of everyday life, a reliable source of cheeseburger delicacies, crispy French fries and refreshing beverages that continue to supply the goods to those both young and those young at heart. When consuming McDonalds however, its unlikely many of us have ever truly considered where this establishment was born from and thankfully for all us, the story is a real doozy.

It's often the case these days that high profile, well-marketed biopics are reliable as a Big Mac (you always know what you're going to get) but John Lee Hancock's film is imbedded with both an energy and pace that elevates it above the usual bio-fair and with another awards worthy turn from Michael Keaton as its centrepiece, this enthralling slice of history is a fabulously entertaining ride tinged in nostalgic 1950's vibes and garnished with a quick- smart script from The Wrestler screenwriter Robert D. Siegel.

Capturing the time, place and allurement of this mankind changing business model, The Founder does a great job of transporting us back in time as we ride alongside struggling salesman Ray Kroc, whose eyes are opened when he comes across the McDonald brothers, whose business model of ""fast food"" finally gives Ray the chance his so longed for all his life, to make a buck and then some.

Keaton's performance as Kroc is quite the feat. His a genuinely cold and calculated character but as the film begins we are happy to see him put in the hard yards as his franchise model of stores takes off but as the brand grows so does Kroc's ego and Keaton's performance morphs naturally as it does in fascinating and unexpected ways.

Come the films later stages, the real feat of Keaton's turn comes into the spotlight and what we're left with is a layered character brought to life by the performer, whether it's in comical situations or brutally raw moments shared with lawyers, Keaton is on fire here and while his ably supported by the likes of Nick Offerman and John Carroll Lynch as the unfortunate McDonald brothers Dick and Mac, The Founder is founded off the back of Keaton's turn and whilst unlikely that this film will find itself in to many awards categories, Keaton is looming as a key player in the upcoming awards season.

The Founder is one of those rare biopics that grabs you from the get-go and doesn't let up.

A well shot, scored and acted studio film that tells a story worth telling (plus one of the best advertisements McDonald's has never paid for), The Founder offers a fascinating insight into the beginnings of the McDonald's brand that also gives us an equally fascinating real life figure and another chance for the career revival of Michael Keaton to continue on its merry way.

The Founder,A solid biopic made worth seeing for Keaton,"The Founder is another tale of the American Dream. It's the kind of tale we've seen a million times before. American man wants to become successful, sacrifices morality for moolah, etc. It's The Godfather, it's The Social Network, it's The Wolf of Wall Street. And The Founder, while entertaining, offers pretty much nothing new, or distinctive, to contribute. It is directed fairly conventionally, the story hits all the beats you'd expect, and it's not going to stick to your memory for too long.

But that discounts the fact that the film is rather well made. Performances are uniformly solid, and the film is undeniably compelling for much of its run time. But the real reason to see the film is the powerhouse performance of Michael Keaton, a neglected actor throughout the 2000s who seems to be finally getting roles that he deserves with this, Spotlight and Birdman to consider. He is slimy, charismatic, and curiously sympathetic in all the right ways.

In all The Founder may not light your world on fire, but it's a rock solid tale of greed and the American Dream that ought to entertain most that it meets.

Side Note -I have no idea why this is playing in Australia over a month before it comes out across the rest of the world, but hey I'm not complaining."

The Founder,Fast Food Nation,"Based on the true story of Ray Kroc, a traveling salesman who franchised the first family-owned McDonald's restaurant and turned it into the international conglomerate that it is today, 'The Founder' tells a fascinating slice of twentieth century history. The title is well chosen, hinting at the dynamic at the heart of the film with Kroc declaring himself the ""founder"" of McDonald's when in fact the idea of fast and efficient food service was never his to begin with - something that becomes a point of contention with the original owners. Michael Keaton is excellent in the lead role, exuding both charm and charisma while also always coming off as if he has something up his sleeve. There are several great shots throughout that linger on his face in close-up as he delivers persuasive sales pitches and there is a magnificent sequence late in the piece where several of his sermons in different locations are edited together to overlap as one big speech. Keaton also does well coming off as both victim and aggressor at varying points. At times, he comes across as an all-too-sympathetic underdog whose dreams are hindered by the McDonalds brothers' unwillingness to compromise in the name of progress. At other points, he seems insanely ruthless with how he circumvents everything in his way. Telling a similar slice of contemporary history, 'The Founder' is bound to be compared to 'The Social Network', to which it does not stack up as well, but it deserves to be considered as a film on its own. The storytelling approach here is more comedic than in the Facebook film and while 'The Founder' may have benefited from even more comedy to lighten the mood, it is an amusing film as it is - and a thought-provoking film when considers its basis in actual fact."
The Founder,Well made but a tough sell since the central figure is difficult to like.,"""The Founder"" is a well made and interesting movie. The filmmakers had so much faith in the film that they counted on it being Oscar bait....and were apparently shocked that it didn't receive a single nomination. Why? Well, I'd bet that the film has one fatal flaw that prevented it from being better received...the central character to the story, Ray Kroc, was not an easy man to like. Selling a film that exposes him as a rather cut-throat businessman probably left more than a few people cold when the film ended.

The story begins in the early 1950s. Ray Kroc is a salesman, on the road constantly, trying to sell his milkshake machines to restaurants...and without a lot of apparent success. However, when he comes upon the Dick and Mac McDonald and their restaurant in San Bernadino, California, Ray developed a dream...to franchise the McDonald brother's design and concept. The film is about the early rocky years getting the franchises going as well as how Ray handled his eventual success.

I have no complaints about the film...it was well made and engaging. But, as I said above, the central character, Ray Kroc, was a tough sell. Although the world, and especially America, has a huge love of nostalgia, learning that the nostalgic feeling engendered by McDonald's is actually the dream of a rather amoral and scheming man. Still, it is worth seeing...just not exactly a feel good film."
The Founder,I'm Lovin' It,"A competently crafted, steadily paced & extensively researched biographical drama that's further uplifted by Michael Keaton's fantastic performance, The Founder covers the rags to riches tale of an ambitious salesman who sensed & tapped the potential of a small fast-food diner in California and turned it into one of the largest & most successful restaurant chains in the world with a bit of hustle, persistence & ruthlessness.

Set in the 1950s, The Founder tells the story of Ray Kroc, a travelling salesman who comes across a small diner operated by two McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California and is left dazzled by their lightning-fast service, high-quality food & strong work ethic. Wanting to be a part of their business, he joins them as their franchising agent to expand the fast-food chain all over America, and ultimately buys the company from the brothers.

Directed by John Lee Hancock, The Founder is as much about the cut-throat world of business as it is about the rise of McDonald's, and is told in an intuitive manner that keeps the interest alive at all times. Hancock handles the subject matter with restraint, maintains a firm grip over all aspects, and never deviates from the main premise. Also, the momentum is never lost as it moves from the discovery, creation, operation & expansion of McDonald's to the ultimate swindling.

The old style McDonald's restaurants depicted in the film are in tune with the timeline this film is set in and the vast countryside shooting locations help in further evoking its 1950s era. The sharp focus & still handling of camera, in addition to its warm colour palette, helps in providing a homely texture to its images. Editing keeps the pace steady and provides a tight & gripping structure to its plot while Carter Burwell's score is ever present in the background and silently performs its duties.

Coming to the performances, The Founder features a talented cast in Michael Keaton, John Carroll Lynch, Nick Offerman, Linda Cardellini, Patrick Wilson, B.J. Novak & Laura Dern. Leading from the front is Keaton who delivers another strong performance in what's the second coming of his acting career as he brings Kroc to life with flair, passion & panache. Lynch & Offerman are in as McDonald brothers and play their part convincingly, plus the moments between them & Kroc is as amusing as it is riveting.

On an overall scale, The Founder is a carefully investigated & smartly scripted biopic that's just as informative as it is entertaining and wonderfully illustrates the rise of the man who dared to dream bigger and single-handedly turned a small fast-food restaurant into a billion-dollar conglomerate with his aggressive business practices. It's also commendable for keeping Kroc's personal life out of the main narrative, something most Hollywood biopics are guilty of. A mostly satisfying journey, this story of McDonald's made me go ""I'm Lovin' It"" more than once over the course of its runtime, and is definitely worth a shot."
The Founder,The Founder (2017),"This film is not really what you expect it to be. Upon first glance at the trailer you would think its the story of the founder of McDonalds who comes from nothing and works hard to start a global fast food chain. That's really not what this was about. I would say this film is quite unique; I never expected the roots of a popular fast food chain to get a film. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued to see the film though. Overall, I'd say its a mixed bag with a stronger first section than second.

Michael Keaton plays Ray Kroc, a down out of luck milk shake mixer salesman, who one day stumbles upon a restaurant owned by the McDonald brothers. This restaurant innovative service where orders are made in 30 seconds or less, through the technical setup of equipment, staff, and assembly line-like practices. Kroc becomes enamored with the idea of fast food chains and eventually sets into motion multiple stores around the country, much to the brothers behest. Kroc is not a lovable guy at all, if anything he is an extremely selfish, self-motivated snake who betrays his partners and family. Keaton is perfectly fine in this yet again continuing his acting resurgence.

There is betrayal and greed at every turn, thus the films marketing doesn't prepare you for the type of greedy character seen in Kroc. It is what it is and this is probably how many business men get ahead in life. It was interesting to hear the McDonald brothers story and seeing just how the first store started up. As stated earlier, the film starts off very engaging but goes through lapses of being uninteresting despite being in an unfamiliar place from a storytelling perspective.

I wasn't sure if this was going to be one of the Oscar season pictures but after seeing it I can see why it isn't because it becomes too generic and doesn't really offer much worth talking about besides a story that may be shocking to people. I'm not really sure if its a film we needed but at the very least you may be interested to see the history of probably the most recognizable fast food chain in the world. They should rename this film The Thief.

The Founder,An interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire,"The Founder is a biographical drama film starring Michael Keaton based on the life of American businessman and founder of the McDonald's Corporation Ray Kroc. Whether you love the McDonald's brand or hate it, this film offers a compelling view into the way it has captivated us all with its worldwide presence.

In 1954, salesman Ray Kroc (Michael Keaton) meets with brothers Dick (Nick Offerman) and Mac (John Carroll Lynch) McDonald, the owners of the hamburger restaurant known as ""McDonald's"". Fascinated by the brothers' ability to have burgers and fries cooked in a matter of seconds, Kroc suggests the idea of franchising the restaurant nationwide, hoping to use this as a way to take control of the company and earn money for himself.

Featuring yet another terrific performance from the ever-versatile Michael Keaton, his second best behind Birdman, The Founder is an interesting look into the way one man helped turn a small hamburger restaurant into a global fast food empire. It is fascinating seeing how one simple idea - fast food - has changed the culinary world forever. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the misfortune the McDonald brothers went through as a result of franchising their name and the exploitation they received. I should also mention that the film reminded me of the 2010 film The Social Network, with its similar plot about one man exploiting a clever idea from two brothers for his own financial gain.

I rate it 8/10."
The Founder,Made me furious which means it's good,"Sometimes you choose to watch a movie just because it has one of your favourite actors, but you can't imagine how many feelings you will get from that movie. I got exactly one feeling and that is hate towards Ray Kroc and the whole McDonalds franchise. I don't know how this film was supposed to present Kroc, because if its point is to idolise him even the slightest, I'm just even more furious about the whole thing.

I got to appreciate Michael Keaton though. He doesn't portray Kroc simply as an asshole, even though that's what he is. We still see him as the jerk he was, since his actions are shown as ruthless as they were. Now of course in the capitalist wonderland this all might seem admirable, but the audience should be able to see that ruthlessness as something other than ""business blah blah blah"" or whatever it is to those same asshole businessmen.

I mean I could go to a full anti-capitalist speech here, but perhaps I shouldn't. After all the fact that this movie made me actually feel something this strongly and made me think means it's a very well made movie. I didn't really have time to consider the technical side of the movie since I was mostly thinking about how angry the story made me and how much I wanted to punch Kroc.

The Founder can be a bit boring at times but it definitely makes you think about the capitalist s##thole that is the US and it's business world, and it makes you angry. Of course I'm not here to tell you what to think."
The Founder,A missed opportunity,"I'd heard, jokingly, that The Founder was a remake of the Social Network, but instead of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg, it's Ray Kroc and McDonald's. By all accounts, this should have been a captivating movie starring Michael Keaton who seems to be getting better with age.

The Founder never really commits to a clear picture of who the McDonald brothers were, nor who was Ray Kroc. The McDonald brothers are certainly somewhere on the autism spectrum. What other personality type would have wanted to or could have invented fast food? Their quirkiness is bemusing and not much else. We instead see more glimpses into Ray Kroc, who might be a psychopath, a salesman who knows McDonald's could spread across the globe. He emerges from a vapid life into one of billions, becoming a ruthless monster who refuses to let anyone stand in the way of his vision. He even employs selective memory and conveniently overlooks all the hard work it took to establish the Speedee system, all the exploited labor that served the billions.

The biggest question left open is whether Ray Kroc was a psychopath before, or after, he became rich and powerful. The movie ignores pretty much every social aspect of commodity consumption and capitalizing on other people's work. What we are left with is about as satisfying as a Filet-O-Fish."
The Founder,The Real Story of a Real Jerk,"McDonald's has been one of if not the most influential brands in the world. It has been a staple of not only American fast food but American life, whether you like like it or not. Going into The Founder I did not know a lot Ray Kroc, other than that he was in some way involved with the mega chain. Turns out Kroc is a real piece of work, and while there were things about this story that interested me, overall what we get is the tale of an asshole and how he succeeded in screwing some people out of a lot of money. This is where the movie runs into its main problem, half the time it feels like praying at the alter of Kroc, and the other half feels like a pulled punch to the gut of ultra-capitalists.

The first act tells about Kroc struggling as a milkshake mixer salesman, when he discovers a restaurant unlike any of the others that he has visited. The speed of service, the consistency of the quality of the food and the way it brought the community together draws Kroc to the burger shack known as McDonald's. The rest of the movie plays out with Kroc slowly bleeding the McDonald brothers of their company and really the original intention of the restaurant. Kroc did implement some innovations that pushed McDonald's into a worldwide franchise, but these moments mostly come after the events of the movie. The innovative ideas that we do see are almost exclusively created by the McDonald brothers, who as previously stated basically get screwed the whole movie.

Michael Keaton is probably looking right back at you from both sides of the screen right now, so you have probably figured out he plays an important role here. Keaton plays it with his normal light comedy tone, which would work perfectly if the movie had embraced it more. I have no idea what Ray Kroc is like so I really don't know if he was anything like Keaton's performance, but darn it if he is not enjoyable to watch. When Kroc begins his descent into jerk off Keaton is professional enough to pull off the switch in character just enough to keep the original idea of him intact. For the most part everyone else just pops in and out. Nick Offerman and John Carrol Lynch play the McDonald brothers who come and go quite regularly, again mostly getting screwed. Poor Laura Dern plays Kroc's first wife, who is relegated to the bummer at home. She never gets to be anything but disappointing which in turn, is disappointing.

The McDonald brothers main concern for franchising their restaurant, which had taken them years to perfect just the way they wanted it was that the quality of the food would suffer and thus the name would suffer. Now some 60 odd years later it is funny to think about how that is exactly what happened, and there in lies the main problem with The Founder. There is no critical look at the moves Kroc made. They don't fully back his decisions, but they also don't condemn them. This movie needed a side to take, with it stuck in the middle the story becomes so much less than it could have been. It's like if The Big Short did not make up its mind when it comes to the bankers that caused the financial meltdown.

My final thoughts on the movie are pretty simple, there is an interesting story here, where in some ways the world was changed for the better, and some for the worse. I just don't believe it was told in the right way, and while not an incredibly important tale was one that was not difficult to sit through. at an hour and 55 minute run time, The Founder just sneaks under the magic 2 hour mark, but honestly could have been about 15 minutes shorter. There was something here, but with the tone of the movie stuck on the fence, The Founder is pretty forgettable."

The Founder,Who would think a film about McDonald's would be this interesting?,"I was actually surprised when it was over, because the movie had gone by so fast. Who knew a film about McDonald's would be this interesting? Of course Michael Keaton has no problem diving into the character of wheeler dealer Ray Kroc. His perfect foil is Nick Offerman as Dick McDonald, deadpan, a solid rock of a man with strong ideas about integrity. John Carroll Lynch as Mac McDonald, Dick's brother, a taller but more accommodating man, is also outstanding. Linda Cardinelli as Joan Smith, eventually to be Joan Kroc, is quite lovely and looks good in the period costumes. At the end of the film Kroc offers what are now, I believe, called ""alternative facts"" about the founding of McDonald's. The film is very much about two different visions of America as reflected in two different approaches to business.

For car buffs, this film is a must, with many fine 1950s vehicles on display."
The Founder,Good Movie Poor Man,"I need to seperate the movie and the person Ray Kroc.

The movie is quite fantastic and does a superb job of outlining the story of Maccas.

Keaton is brilliant and the supporters Offerman and Carroll Lynch are just as good. Its entertaining and engaging.

Now Mr Kroc. It took me a while to determine how I felt about the man (based only from his portrayl in the movie). He was motivated, ambitous, creative and as was mentioned persistant. Should he have felt slightly aggrieved when the brothers refused to help him when he nearly went broke...probably. He is clearly the primary force behind the Maccas we have today.

What was the deciding factor for me in determining Mr Kroc was not much of a human being? The handshake for royalties. He shook hands on a deal and then renigged on it. That's not what an honourable person does. The McDonalds family missed out on millions of dollars. The Kroc family then donate millions to charity but couldn't send some to the family of creation??? Weak."
The Founder,The Founder!,"The story of the ""founder"" of Mc Donald's and how he made it from a single shop to the largest leading firm in food industry.

Ray Kroc is a desperate salesman trying to sell his product, a milkshake maker that no one needs. To his surprise, he gets an order for 6 machines. He cannot believe it and calls them back if it was true and to add to his surprise, the quantity was raised to 8. He himself goes to the restaurant to see the elegant and professionalism maintained by the brothers called Mac & Dick. Their restaurant is called Mc Donald's. Ray was eager to know their story and the brothers explains all their trade secrets. Ray couldn't sleep that night and goes back to the brothers with a new proposal. Here begins the story of the business tycoon Mc Donald's.

The movie is amazing in all the ways. The director was successful in making the movie very involving and entertaining. Beautiful camera visuals, color tone and production design add to this retro tone of the movie. Performance of the actors are highlight of the movie. Rapid editing makes it a very fast movie with very less or no lagging. This movie is going to shine at the Oscars for sure.

After watching the movie, at-least half of the audience will quit McD for a few days. The market value of McD will be interesting after the world wide release of the film.

A must watch and highly recommended.

The Founder,"Came for Michael Keaton, left to buy a shake and fries.","If you're a Michael Keaton fan, you'll enjoy this movie. He was born to play a salesman. And that's what this movie basically is, a tale about a hardworking salesman. Through hard work, determination, and thinking constantly on ideas to become more successful (with some help from others sometimes), a middle aged struggling salesman can find success when dealt the right cards. Meanwhile the people who invent the possible goldmine business aren't always capable and the best people to progress the idea into greater fortune.

This is a good movie for a business major to watch. Some of the tricks of the trade by what Keaton's character discovered that would make McDonald's grow in popularity and in fortune is common knowledge nowadays, but you still cant help but root him on as he discovers these things. The McDonald brothers on the other hand are too scared to risk anything and are content with what they already accomplished. In this film you see examples of stubbornness on both sides of the main characters, but showing it in opposite ways.The 'go getter' vs the 'we already did's'. Watch this movie if you want to get inspired to go get the already did's and try to show them that everything can be better. Oh and warning, you might get a craving to go eat at McDonald's."

The Founder,"Ironic, isn't it !!","I'm not gonna write a synopsis of this film; others have done that already. Small town salesman stumbles on the chance of a lifetime, and from it creates a food empire. Along the way, things start to change. Against the noble-minded but provincial McDonald brothers, Ray Kroc struggles upstream, good-hearted American dream seeker at first, then insidiously segueing into the vicious, cannibalistic uber-capitalist that he insists is absolutely necessary to establish great marches for himself.

Well acted, well done, this movie tells the story chillingly well. Keaton, with his indomitable go-forward-and-blitz-the-opposition really knocked my socks off. To no small manner was his dry, monotonic, gravelly voice expressing his quick, no-nonsense, no-further-argument directives in a manner like orders from a colonel: end-of-story, no questions accepted.

OK, the movie. But why did I call it ironic in my summary? Now, the product. A few years back I showed the movie ""Supersize me"" to a class of high school students. For those of you who don't know, it's a doc of a healthy young man who eats nothing but super-sized McDonald's burgers, fries and cokes (not diet cokes either) for a month. Afterward, he was obese and diagnosed with a variety of ailments that took a lot longer than the month he OD'ed on his McGorgings. So, putting these two films side by side is the iron: A man with very questionable ethics creates a gonzo empire that sells a product with questionable health value. What would the original McDonald brothers think about those burgers now? I wonder what goes into them? Oh, yes, I've eaten plenty of them, in a few places here and abroad. I'll give the movie a solid B+."
The Founder,worth watching,"If it weren't for the shrewd business man Ray Kroc McDonalds wouldn't exist today as we know it. He took the idea from the. Mc Donald's brothers and turned it into a franchise. Soon more people followed and the menu went from just burgers, fries, coke and milkshakes to chicken sandwiches, chicken nuggets, fish and yes the quarter pounder and the big mac. Michael Keaton was extrodinary in this movie. Very well written and acted. I remember when McDonalds first came out, A lot of cities didn't want it around. It put Royal Castle and a few others out of business. Turn on Netflix and sit down and watch this epic movie about how McDonalds became a corporation just because one man ran with an idea."

Minority Report,Underrated & A Film To Think About,"This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).

The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.

The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?

I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (""Cold Case"") and Neal McDonough (""Boomtown""). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems."
Minority Report,"Looks great, interesting story","May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.

In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.

I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10."
Minority Report,Minority Report is one of the top films of 2002,"I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie."

Minority Report,What must film makers do? This was GOOD - believe nothing else.,"I think some people just write reviews for sites like this because they like to complain. I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.

The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already hurtling with some speed).

The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;)

The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours.

The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured, as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.

Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately care about, innocent and tragic.

Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably never find another one you like again. But if you need another reason, go to see it just for another fantastic soundtrack from the master, John Williams.

Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie."

Minority Report,Looks like I'M in the minority here...,"Based on the mostly positive reviews for this, it looks like I'm in the minority here (wink), because I don't think that this film quite worked the way it should have, or the way it could have. It's quite rare that I leave a moviegoing experience feeling dissatisfied, but I think that the movie set high expectations with a very cool premise, but then lost it in a mess. I can break down my thoughts into two categories:

1. Plot

The notion of ""precrime"" is pretty slick, and I don't mind that the first 20 minutes of the movie spend time explaining and demonstrating it. But it sets rules and guidelines that are ultimately broken by the end, leaving me quite confused as to why I should buy into these plot points in the first place. I don't really find myself feeling like they are plot holes, but more that the premise becomes loose and messy. To be reductive, in a movie where beings are predicting the future, there really shouldn't be too many surprises or plot twists, right?

2. Tone

This is what stuck out to me first. This movie plays it pretty straight, and doesn't have comic relief characters (like Goldblum in ""Jurassic Park). So when the first big fight scene breaks out, the tone shifts and things start to get quite silly (bumping a breakfast table, interrupting a student practicing saxophone), and then all of a sudden it feels like ""Men in Black."" I welcome moments of levity, but the ones here did not feel earned. Any cheerful or ""funny"" moments really stuck out from the rest of the film.

I won't dock it any points for weird SFX or anything, even if I think that the ""conducting"" while using touchscreens looks super forced and unnatural.

Ultimately, its 145-minute runtime allows it to explore more plot twists. The movie doesn't necessarily feel long or slow, but it does have a moment towards the end where it felt like it should have ended. I think the script was trying to do way too much, and resulted in having four separate stories that barely dovetail gracefully.

I don't feel inclined to give Spielberg or a Williams much credit here. I think there are some cool sci-fi moments, and some good performances (though I don't think that anyone delivers a Top-5 performance here), and that's why I feel like a 6/10 rating is appropriate."
Minority Report,Full of imagination.,"Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.

The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo's H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story's inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg's occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it's not 'nuke the fridge' bad).

7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the 'sick stick' a police baton that makes the victim projectile vomit."
Minority Report,Minority Report,"So - can you be arrested for a crime that you haven't actually committed yet? I suppose that is conspiracy - but this cleverly crafted crime drama questions even the morality of that stance. Tom Cruise is a policeman in the ""pre-crime"" unit who uses information from three people who are able to see into the future, to arrest the spiralling crime rates by intercepting the perpetrators on the cusp of their criminality. Murderers, rapists, bank robbers - you name it, and this has a profound effect on the crime rate. All looks plain sailing until Cruise ""Anderton"" becomes embroiled in a potential killing of his own, and his erstwhile colleagues - not least Colin Farrell (""Witwer"") and Max von Sydow (""Director Burgess') are on his trail using his own techniques against him. Steven Spielberg has concocted a plot that, though complex, is relatively easy to follow with plenty of action and thriller elements that do exactly what they are supposed to. The ending is maybe just a bit disappointing - far too tidy for my liking; but Cruise, Farrell and von Sydow combine well to generate a fair degree of menace and suspense to keep it interesting. The CGI hasn't really stood the test of time so well and I hope Bulgari (amongst others) got their money's worth - I wouldn't rush out and buy one, but I would watch the film again."
Minority Report,You still have a choice...,"Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects. Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.

Cruise takes the lead role here as John Anderton, who leads, more or less, the agency of police that prevent all murders on the basis of predictions from three Pre-Cogs (one of them Samantha Morton who has the most important role of the three). The system is presumably perfect, until to the surprise of Anderton, he is seen to commit a murder and so starts his quest to try and find out if there is a flaw in thirty six hours. This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.

Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures. Grade: A+ or A"
Minority Report,A merely good Dick adaptation,Comentario no disponible
Minority Report,Wasted Opportunity,"This film has elements to it that could've made it a dystopian masterpiece, yet it failed due to its at times unrealistic writing and unamphatic character development and lack of deep conclusion.

Action scenes are great and the idea out there is pretty great it just has its missing pieces.

Tom Cruise is doing a good job as the leading action hero as he always does - his bread and butter."
Minority Report,One of the best/most complex science fiction films,"Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a ""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.

We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.

Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black & white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.

But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.

This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.

""The Maltese Falcon"" ~ film noir ""A Clockwork Orange"" ~ science fiction ""Blade Runner"" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)

***** out of *****"
Minority Report,Amazing concept well made by master filmmaker,"It's 2054. Crime has been virtually eliminated from Washington D.C. area due to the Department of Precrime. They use three Pre-cogs to predict future crimes and arrest the criminals before any crime actually happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) investigates the precrimes. However one day, the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will murder and the system is now coming after him. He kidnaps the most powerful pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) and discovers a flaw in the system. Federal agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is on the manhunt as Anderton tries to prove he's innocent of a crime he's yet to commit.

The concept of free will vs determinism from Philip K. Dick is amazing. The production from Steven Spielberg is terrific. The movie is so well made that it maintains its tension with all the crazy ideas being thrown at the audience. Tom Cruise is the perfect protagonist for this movie. He has a touch of that boy scout with a dark edge. He matches the intensity of the material. There is a good mystery, compelling performances, and expertly made all growing out of a great story. It does wrap up a little too neatly. I'm not sure a Spielberg movie could have gone that dark."
Minority Report,Philip K Dick inspired sci fi gem,Well worth a watch. This has stood the test of time. Tom Cruise plays it straight as an officer in the Columbia District Pre Crime Division. Excellent special effects and good performances throughout.
Minority Report,Minority Report,"Minority Report is a scuzzy futuristic action thriller based on a short story by Philip K Dick.

John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is law enforcer in a pioneering Pre Crime unit in Washington D.C. He catches murderers before they commit the crime thanks to some psychics called Precogs who can see these future crimes.

Anderton is an ace cop who is also part Judge Dredd. He he also takes drugs. The after effects of losing his son in an abduction that resulted in his marriage crumbling.

Murder rate has gone down in DC and the system is about to go national under the leadership of Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow.) Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is the Federal agent who arrives to examine the system. He is sceptical and is also out to get Anderton.

Anderton's world falls apart when Precogs saw a vision of him killing a man that he does not know. Now his colleagues wants to arrest him. Anderton needs to see if the system of pre crimes he believed in has any flaws. He thinks Witwer has set him up.

Steven Spielberg after his second Best Director Oscar win attempts to be a different type of filmmaker. Eschewing Ridley Scott's dark neon look of Blade Runner. He has gone for washed out colours and hi tech. Characters get tailored adverts but it also allows the film company to introduce product placements. Some of the brands ain't going to make it into 2054.

Minority Report is also a murder mystery with religious symbolisms. The three Precogs are seen as religious deities by some. One man immediately kneels and starts to confess his sins when he sees one.

The screenplay also plays around the ideas of Isaac Asimov. What if this perfect system have flaws and it can be exploited?

The movies works better as a sci fi mystery thriller. I just felt that the action sequences were tagged on, allowing for Tom Cruise to run like a rabbit. The clever scene was when one of the Precogs Agatha (Samantha Morton) guides Anderton in the mall.

However there are a few weak links in the narrative which resorts to cliches. Witwer begins to have doubts about Anderton's guilt but then he makes a clumsy error, surprisingly for someone who was also an experienced homicide cop. The comparisons to Judge Dredd makes the villain easy to guess.

The ending was also a little too pat especially when the villain is publicly revealed but still gets to have a showdown with Anderton."
Minority Report,A rare dose of true brilliance,"In the year 2054, Washington DC is run by a new type of crime fighting system - PreCrime. Using sophisticated computer and neural technology, the police are warned of crimes that will occur (via ""previsions"") in the future and they try to stop them. With a 100% success rate and no murder in their jurisdiction for the past six years the system looks flawless. A coming vote, which looks very hopeful for PreCrime, will instill the system nationwide. But when Chief John Anderton, a loyal and decorated PreCrime cop, is seen to be killing someone in one of the previsions he suspects that someone set him up and that not everything is as perfect as it has been made out to be.

It doesn't happen very often that a big studio production with a big name star produces such a great movie. But here it is. Spielberg and his team have crafted an engrossing vision of the future that is not only good looking with its top-notch special effects, but thought provoking and actually interesting on a pure story level. Adapted from one of science fiction's cleverest authors the story is complex and thought provoking on many levels. Not only does it get you thinking about the possibilities where the film can and cannot go, but it will get you thinking about what you yourself actually do.

The direction is also among Spielberg's best with a terrific pace and nail biting tension in some scenes that almost recalls Hitchcock. Backed up, of course, by a great score from John Williams. The movie's vision is also great - the whole futuristic world is shown in what are not just money/eye candy shots, but shots that really place you in the film's world and take you for a terrifically exciting ride. Also of note is Peter Stormare, who has a brilliant, but brief, appearance as a whacko surgeon.

One of the best science fiction films to come out of Hollywood in a long while. 10/10

Rated PG-13 for violence"
Minority Report,Interpretations,"It's the year 2054 and mankind through the good graces of pioneering criminologist Max Von Sydow we're about to abolish crime all together. Von Sydow employs three psychics, no doubt the three best in the world and while it looks life is a pretty dull thing for them, spending all that time in water the better to receive images they're doing yeoman service to mankind anticipating murders to come. Right at the beginning of the film we see them in action as police are dispatched to capture Arye Gross as he's about to murder his wife and her boy toy.

But some disturbing images come in regarding police chief Tom Cruise murdering a man who he doesn't even know. Now Cruise is a Richard Kimble like fugitive and he hasn't done the terrible deed he's supposed to do. But one of the water bound psychics turns in a different interpretation of the images she sees. It's that Minority Report that Cruise is interested in so Samantha Morton is taken by Tom who wants very much to find out what's going so he can alter his destiny if possible.

I won't say more other than destinies can be altered and images can be manipulated and wrongly interpreted by some malevolent forces at work.

Cruise and Von Sydow and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances for Steven Spielberg. And Spielberg's own vision of the future is fascinating. I did love those images of horses making a comeback as a method of transportation. I'm guessing that fossil fuels had polluted the planet enough and we wanted biodegradable waste once again.

Science fiction is always interesting, even the worst future films offer us someone's vision of the future be Steven Spielberg or Ed Wood. Spielberg at least has the talent to bring it off.

And maybe crime prevention taken to its ultimate is not such a good thing. Watch Minority Report and see how you feel."

Minority Report,Dick's Paranoia Watered Down to Hollywood Chase Flick,"I went to see ""Minority Report"" as a Philip Dick fan, not for Tom Cruise.

As soon as I heard he was cast, I knew he was either mis-cast or the movie would substantially change the original story. Ed Harris would have been a brilliant choice for Dick's intent in showing a mid-life crisis of faith with bureaucracy, and more logically setting up the conflict with his older (Max von Sydow as his usual craggy self) and younger (terrifically aggressive Colin Farrell) competitors.

In Dick's story the titular discovery is a shocking revelation of the bankruptcy of policy-making behind bureaucratic intent, whereas here it's just a means to an end for Cruise's character to clear his name. Instead we get an action story that grafts Dick's story outline onto a tribute to George Lucas's brilliant student thesis project ""THX-1138,"" which he himself later expanded into a feature film; I always cite those films as the best visual analysis of bureaucracy. I guess Spielberg wasn't satisfied that we never really knew what the politics were in Lucas's films so he provides explicit reasons via a personal rather than systemic conspiracy theory for the chase and an optimistic conclusion.

On its own, we get a rippling Hollywood chase movie with a soupcon of the old ""The X Files"" paranoia, now newly relevant about our Justice Dept. arresting people, and even several laughs.

The cinematography for the future is wonderfully metallic and there's so many clever CGI's that the long credits list three ""in memoriam""s to colleagues.

Lois Smith is very effective as a cynical inventor, reminding me of the last time an older woman made a key appearance in a sci fi epic, ""Outland"" in a role not necessarily written for a woman.

John Williams's music is interferingly bombastic.

(originally written 7/5/2002)"
Minority Report,"One of the rare, great science fiction movies","It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed. Spielberg's triumph with ""Schindler's List"" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... ""Jurassic Park II"", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed (""Hook"" had its moments). His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in 2001).

But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy. I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance. I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better). Yet, in the end, big deal. The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable. Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of ""Blade Runner"". The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.

Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance). This is interpretation is strained. Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here. When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, ""It's best not to think of them as human"", I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement. The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals. Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all. (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder. But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)

The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge. After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve. But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose. It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one. (Apart from the precognition, that is.) Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake. (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why. Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)

The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances. They're all good. Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that ""Minority Report"" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life."

Jab We Met,"Lovely, simple and full of life","Imtiaz Ali's Jab We Met is one of the most refreshing love stories made in recent times. It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film's mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor's film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks."
Jab We Met,My faith has been restored !,"I love everything about Indian movies. Even if they sometimes come as unrealistic, but this movie is something different. I've had the misfortune of watching many movies that were either too unrealistic or too westernised which made them lose that special magical Indian touch.

This movie had that touch. Kareena proved that she can indeed act without over-acting and the chemistry between her and Shaheed was incredible. Shaheed also proved that he can be taken as a serious actor.

I loved the songs and the simplicity of the sets. there were no over-budgeted scenes of Indians living abroad. This movie was all in all Indian in its essence and that's what made it a big hit."
Jab We Met,Now that's entertainment!,"Imtiaz Ali's 'Jab We Met' is cinema at its best! One of the finest Romanctic love stories to come out of Indian Cinema. A simple story told in the most interesting and enjoyable manner. The film's first hour is enjoyable, the second is exactly the same. 'Jab We Met' holds your attention from almost start to end, leaving the viewer completely satisfied. The film was a success at the box office, and has remained to be a fan favorite. Thumbs up!

Songs: The sound-track is a brownie point. Tum Se Hi and Mauja Hi Mauja are superb songs.

Performances: Kareena Kapoor is outstanding. She got all the awards in the best actress category and she, without a doubt deserved them. Shahid Kapur is fantastic. He's natural from start to end. Pawan Malhotra and Dara Singh are good in supporting role. Samuya Tandon looks cute. Tarun Arora is adequate.

On the whole, 'Jab We Met' is a pure example of entertaining cinema. As said before, its one the finest romantic films to come out of Indian Cinema in years."
Jab We Met,Kareena Kapoor is incredible!,"I am new to Indian movies. But I think I have just fallen in love with Kareena Kapoor. Honestly, I think this actress is more charismatic than any of the big Hollywood or European names I know right now. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole world will soon know about her. Tell me if you know any American or European actress who can even start to level with her in terms of style and beauty - and most of all - charm. None! Because of her, this movie is one of the most endearing love stories I have ever seen. It just makes you fall in love - what better can you say about a romance? And I am not usually interested in these kinds of movies, plus this is only about the 5th bollywood movie I have ever seen."
Jab We Met,So Sweet!,"I have grown up watching so many Hindi flicks, which invariably are love stories by the way. However, there is something different about this movie which sets it apart from the usual stuff. It is fresh and young - something which is missing these days. The songs too keep playing in your head long after you've listened to them. In short, it is not a drag.

Both Shahid Kapur and Kareena seem to be at their peak in this movie. I don't know how to compare their roles in this movie to ones in their previous flicks, but I must admit that they make a good pair. Kareena's excessively talkative personality matches very nicely with Shahid's reserved character. There are no villains too.

It is a pity that Shahid and Kareena will not be starring together in the foreseeable future...Enjoy! (8/10)"
Jab We Met,Jab We Met is the BEST!,"Jab We Met is definitely one of the best movies I've seen so far. Everything is very nice about this movie, totally perfect.

My Reviews: Kareena Kapoor - She really impressed me with this movie. I love how the way she portrayed the lovable & talkative Geet to the sensitive & sad Geet on the second half. She is the life of the movie, no doubt.

Shahid Kapoor - We all know that Shahid is a good actor, but in this movie, we saw something different. We are used to see Shahid in chocolate, college stories, but Jab We Met proved that he can do serious roles without any problems.

Music: Mauja Hi Mauja would definitely my favorite. They saved the best for the last. Mauja Hi Mauja is the best song for the film. But for some reason, it reminded me of ""Macarena"" (a popular Spanglish song) and ""Simarik"" (a famous Turkish song).

Story: It's really a very predictable story, but I can say it's refreshing. Why? Most Bollywood movies have heroines that are very ""damsel-in-distress"" and have no relevance in the story. Jab We Met, on the other hand, has a female for a lead. You can see a woman's pain when she's heartbroken, which I can say is very realistic and I can totally relate to it.

Overall, 9/10 is my rating. Good movie, good actors, good story, good music. Very good. :)"
Jab We Met,As fresh as it can be,"If a director has courage and the guts to take an outdated story line and execute it to a perfection that is altogether to a new height; new level, the director seriously has got some talent. If you ask me a good/talented director is all you need to get the best out of everything; be it a story line, situation or performers. Same situation same actors has brought such a new , absolute fresh piece of cinema, which probably would have been another needle in the hack had it been directed by any run of the mill director. The store line is the usual girl meets boy on a journey moving towards their own destinations and eventually fall in love but again the execution is so damn superb and realistic that no situation in the movie looks out of place. The dialogs are sparkling despite being mature. The funny moments are truly funny and emotions look absolute real. U immediately relate to them. Over all the chemistry Imtiaz Ali (who directed soocha na tha) manages to built between the lead characters is stunning, absolute real, natural and believable, I have not seen (and I am sure people would agree) such a sweet and heart warming chemistry in any romantic couple for a loooong time. Music is good as well with 2 absolutely amazing romantic songs........""Tum he se"" and ""Aaoge jab tum"". People specially couples whose heart throb with a universal feeling called love go and watch the movie, you would come out mesmerized by the romantic extravaganza.......trust me."
Jab We Met,A Funny Little Film,"I was at a Punjabi wedding of one of my dear friends early this week. The folks there danced away the whole 3 days like there is no tomorrow. Lot of Jab We Met brought back all that even before the week ended.

There is so much life in some people we meet, they infuse faith back in it for us with their sheer presence. Geet is happy-go-lucky girl living life on her terms. Aditya is at the lowest ebb of his life. They meet and life changes for both of them.

Imtiaz Ali knows how to make small, endearing films. His characters are next door, his settings are small towns or cities and his stories are simple. He did it well with Socha Na Tha and Ahista Ahista. He hits bang on again with Jab We Met.

The casting is precise. I was pleasantly surprised to see Shahid mature up to his role and Kareena bring alive the lively Punjabi girl that she plays. Both of them then slipped into their role reversals with equal ease. Rest of the cast is equally good. I'd like to see more of Pawan Malhotra. He is a very talented actor but hardly seen around.

The background score sets an intriguing tone within minutes of the film starting. But it does not maintain that high standard throughout and averages out. The music, otherwise, has some romantic and bhangra numbers which won't stay on charts for long.

Jab We Met is an entertaining romantic comedy. Go and enjoy it."
Jab We Met,"Excellent Movie, Great Plot, direction and songs.","So i basically made an IMDb account just because i wanted to comment on this movie. Its great, a very good mix of business and life (im a business student) and it teaches so much about life. I recommend this movie to everyone. The plot is excellent, a bit predictable just like any Hindi movie , but the way the story goes is great. The humor is great, although some of my friends complained of it being a bit dry, but you need an open mind to enjoy it and look beyond the obvious. The songs are beautiful, has an ending item song which is a great dance mix. Has soft songs (atif aslam style), a punjabi song (bhangra style) and pretty much its a complete movie for everyone.

A great Family Movie and A Great Date Movie."
Jab We Met,A Cute Romantic-Comedy,"Devasted by the news that his recently widowed mother has decided to remarry and that his fiancé has chosen another man to wed, a wealthy businessman by the name of ""Aditya D. Kashyap"" (Shahid Kapoor) boards a train in Mumbai to get away from it all. He doesn't know where the train is heading and doesn't really care. He just wants to be left alone and, in his misery, even contemplates suicide while on the train. It's during this time that he happens to meet a young woman by the name of ""Geet Kaur Dhillon"" (Kareena Kapoor) who is not only extremely talkative but also radiates a positive personality as well. To that extent, she even suggests that he travels with her to her small village in order to marry her younger sister ""Roop Kaur Dhillon"" (Saumya Tandon) at the same time she elopes with her secret boyfriend ""Anshuman"" (Pawan Malhotra) so that the two of them can be related by law. Needless to say, Aditya thinks she is completely insane but when the two of them temporarily disembark from the train-and subsequently become stranded in another village--he finds himself becoming more enmeshed in her crazy scheme. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I stumbled upon this film quite by accident and I didn't know whether I would like it or not. To my surprise, I found it to be a really cute romantic-comedy which passed the time extremely well. I especially liked the performances of both Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapooro who played their parts quite well and seemed to enjoy working with one another. That being said, I enjoyed this film and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."
Jab We Met,.Imtaz Ali is Hrishikesh Mukherjee of modern times....,"Remember Hrishida's movies? We laughed with it, loved it, because he created the characters who we could relate. You look around, these characters are in one of your friends. Imtiaz Ali is in the same league. The characters, the shots, the sets, the train, the bus - we have been there! We have lived them.

And he creates a gem incorporating these elements. It is humour in pure form! It will brighten you up, no matter how grumpy you may be feeling! I think this is one of the loveliest movie of the year. Pure, unadulterated fun! The strength of the movie is in its script, and in its characters, esp that of Kreena Kpoor (try saying that, you know what I mean) - yeah - Ms Kapoor is in her elements. She plays the role of sikhni convincingly! The lingo, the body language, the attitude, she is 100%! Kareena Kapoor 2.0 (that's what I call post Chameli) rocks! Every movie, she surprises with histrionics, that is very few in current Bollywood can match! And what a transformation from Omkara's Dolly? That's real actress right there! Shahid Kapoor... mmmm, could improve in the acting dept. If I were to choose, I would choose someone like Shreyas Talpade for this role. Shahid has definitely matured as an actor from his chocolate-boy image, but still leaves something to be desired.

In my opinion, the comedy is one of the most difficult of the genres. To execute it well without sounding cheap, or going overboard, or cheesy, is not really easy. Imtiaz Ali, in this case does justice to two most important depts, Writing & Direction! A word about music: Pritam brings a fresh set of music, some of it grows on you after listening few times. Definitely I am not talking of the radio-friendly Mauja Hi Mauja, which is tailor-made for music video channels. Songs like Aao Milo Chalo, Tum Se Hi are real nice pop or soft-rockish tunes. Sandesh Shandilya shares the burden on Aaoge Jab Tum, and Rashid Khan does a fine job on the vocals. On Tum Se Hi, watch out for Ustad Sultan Khan's ever soulful crooning.

I still give it a 8/10 because Shahid Kapoor's acting has rooms for improvement, the second half has rooms for editing and making it more compact. But the movie is worth watching just for Kareena Kapoor's acting! Way to go Imtiaz Ali!"
Jab We Met,"Surprisingly good, unlike most of the love stories","None from my family were that keen about this film. I myself preferred watching a movie directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali instead of this and didn't pay much heed to this film. 'Another love story' I thought because, even though Sanjay's film too are love stories, they have a delightful charm in them which make them stupendous.

I was taken aback after the critics gave this film a 4 out of 5 stars and then, my family decided to watch this movie on the big screen. I yet was ambivalent whether it would live up to my expectations, after watching preposterously bad films like Dhol, Muskaan etc.

I myself admit that I am harsh as a critic and most of my reviews, whether bollywood or Hollywood, are somewhat criticizing the film in some or the other way. I never go with very high expectations, just as a 'normal person', without any feelings to review my feelings after watching the movie and after I left the theater, I was happy and that meant, that the movie was good.

I am afraid that I might give away some important details of the movie deliberately; therefore, I am not going into the story details. I will first mention the points that I liked in the movie:

1) The performances of both the lead characters were strong. Shahid as the 'jeevan see hara hua' man and Kareena as the 'sweet, bumbling but annoying chatterbox' are at top notch in this movie and their chemistry is clearly visible. Shahid, thank God, is portraying a much matured role in this film unlike his other movies and Kareena is just Kareena with great acting.

2) The humor was good in this film. Karrena has good comedy timing while Shahid's expressions just makes anyone laugh, especially in the first half. I even liked the character who plays Kareena's boy friend as he was really funny and it was humorous to watch him get agitated by you'll know when you watch the movie.

3) The first half was really good, witty and humorous as the audience didn't get bored or didn't feel to leave their seats.

4) The songs were a mixture of catchy and melodious. 'Mauja MAuja' and 'Yeh Ishq hai' were really good songs while the others too were decent.

Now, in one paragraph, I will explain the flaws in this movie. I coudn't understand Dara Singh's role at all nor was he funny. The camera effects were not amazing and I felt that the editing was somewhat odd and glitchy. I suddenly realized that the characters were in another place. One or two of the scenes looked as if they were taken from another movie and pasted into this movie. Some of the jokes too were childish and a bit loud. The second part was dragging and you felt as if it was monotonous, that is, if you compare it with the first part.

Overall, it was a relief to watch this movie as I was relieved from a state of shock after watching the abominable film Dhol. But I didn't feel that I could watch it for the second tome immediately after leaving the theater and even after a few days after watching the film. 7 out of 10."
Jab We Met,"Hollywood ""influence"" once again",Plot looks borrowed from the movie Elizabethtown. Though I would love to know people's opinion whether I am right or not?
Jab We Met,"'Jab We Watch' it , we are totally entertained","This is an interesting romantic and funny movie from Imtiaz Ali Khan once again after Socha Na Tha, and it fulfilled my long waiting desires to watch it. Imtiaz is going on in his improvement to produce every time a better movie. And it should inspire all the directors of his genre. The scenes have been mostly shot at outdoor spots like Chandigarh, Kulu, Manali and Shimla, and this entertains us as if we are experiencing ourselves a real tour. Again and again seeing daily studio scenes made the eyes wounded and fed up the mind. And thats why it's a nice pick up at nice time.

Although the storyline is not that new with the old movies as a boy meets girl and slowly fall in love but the way Imtiaz presented each and every scenes are worth to watch. From the beginning to the end I personally enjoyed the whole movie, and happy to spend some amount of bucks on it. After Shikhar this is second time in which Shahid has proved that he has all the required potentialities to become a genius actor one day. But I was damn irritated by Kareena's irritating and annoying much chatty and talkative role. But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story. For Shahid's lovers and fans, you must have got something relaxed after watching this unique love story (just like ME!!!)."
Jab We Met,Shahid n Kareena are wonderful pair....,"Inspite of some frivolous mistakes the movie is worth watching once... Shahid has a decent look n more over the spectacle he wears throughout the movie suits him perfectly... coming to the story... Its an ordinary love story scripted differently... Aditya(Shahid kapoor) son of a successful industrialist is dumped by his girlfriend. Depressed aditya attempt suicide by jumping fro train... but Gita(kareena kapoor) stops him... later a series of events occurs resulting in landing of Aditya at Gita's house... Durin this period Aditya learns to take things easily n Gita teaches him to listen to his heart more often n do rather than what has to be done n not to think much bout result... Gita's marriage is fixed with her childhood friend... But Gita is hell bent upon not marrying him,so she tells aditya abt her plans of running away from the house uninformed.aditya initially opposes but later helps her in doing the act. .. Aditya leaves Gita at Manali where her Boyfriend lives... Aditya returning to his normal life achieves thunderous success having learnt the ""art of living"" from gita... ... But what happens to Gita? Is she happy with whatever decision she took?? watch the movie for answer... Climax is as expected... Music is wonderful... Cinematography is good... Shahid and Kareen are wonderful..."
Jab We Met,A movie thats much more than a movie,"Movies are as much a part of my life as Dal- chawal (rice and pulses) but I can't remember having been as insanely in love with any other bollywood/Hollywood/Tollywood movie as this one and if at all, this love affair has only intensified over the years. That doesn't mean, there haven't been better movies, or the actors in Jab We Met haven't given better performances elsewhere. It only means, somewhere in those 2.5 hours, Jab We Met metamorphoses into something far more substantial than just a movie. On the surface, its a simple story of a guy and a girl but if u dive deep enough, it is a heartwarming assortment of stories, about losing and finding love, about internal and external journeys, about forgetting and rediscovering oneself, about letting go with a smile and above all about finding hope in despair. I won't go into the details of the plot, screenplay, acting,direction or any such technical aspect. You will find plenty of people telling you about that. I can only tell you how i can speak every single dialog, having repeated them a million times in my head, or how I can hum those songs which cheer me every time I feel alone. One little thing though, I can't articulate is how Aditya and Geet stay in my heart permanently and keep telling me once in a while.... ""Go listen to your heart, everything will be fine then."""

Jab We Met,Good I Saw....,"When this movie actually knocked off a few shows of the high profile Saawariya I knew I had to see it, the reviews were very good as well and i must confess i had unnecessarily high expectations from this movie.

The first thing that struck me about this movie was Kareena Kapoor, I've never really liked her, but the moment i saw her climb the train i was smitten, the non-bitchy look really works for her, and i must confess my opinion of her after this movie has completely changed, she looked superb and her acting was very good as well, HER LOUD TALKATIVE CHARACTER ENDEARED MOST OF THE TIMES BUT THERE WERE TIMES IT GOT ON THE NERVES AS WELL (may have been intentional).

THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS COMPLETELY HER MOVIE, shahid makes very good attempts at making this film his but there is no doubt who will walk away with all the kudos.

The movie starts quite well and at a good pace, the hotel decent sequence was particularly brilliant, as were most scenes with the family throughout the movie.

The entire cast including does very well with very good casting specially of the family, nobody really had much of a role except shahid and kareena but each and everyone does a good job in their limited roles.

The movie really loses out is towards the later part of the second half, the reconciliation scene between the 2, the useless song, and the extra long stretched out sequence before the light dawns on Kareena was particularly excruciating though surprisingly un-melodramatic, still this is clearly the weakest part of the movie and what brings down the ratings.

The humour and the 2 main protagonists are clearly the hallmarks of this movie, but what also endears is the lack of melodrama even the climax of the movie which is tailor made for tears had none of them, the kiss was unnecessary considering most of us have scene photos/mms of a much more passionate kiss between the two, hehahaha.

The cinematography of this movie was also very good, the filmmakers were equally adept at capturing the small town station, as they were with the haveli, and the mountains.THE LACK OF FOREIGN LOCALES WAS PARTICULARLY GOOD, AND THIS MOVIE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE SCENIC BEAUTY OF India IS MORE THAT ADEQUATE. Indeed the mountains and its people looked brilliant, im sure thats where im going for my next vacation.

I am an ""in the closet"" romantic comedy lover (obviously ill deny it later), and although i give it full marks for the lack of melodrama ((which is most undesirable for me), the over stretched ending was still very bad.

IF you keep the right expectations unlike me and maybe even pay lesser rates like me than this movie is a clear winner, watch it on TV or DVD and you cant go wrong.

-s the end and nothing but the end.

+/-s kareena did annoy sometimes.

+s Kareena Kapoor, less melodrama, good comedy, nice small movie feel, great acting all around.

total 7/'0 (just fell below expectations that may have been too high but don't want to spoil others experience by giving it a higher rating)."
Jab We Met,Really helped me to get out of my Breakup..,"I really loved someone from years and proposed her some fine day. It turned into no. But i don't have any regret that I have proposed her and it turned into negation. I firmly believe love can't be forced or you can't force somebody to love you. I really liked her the way she was but that's my problem not her. Not at all bad feeling towards her and I hope she progress in her life and may have found someone who liked her or sooner will find better person for her. And finally talking about me i will also find someone who love me unconditionally and I love her from bottom of my heart 💖. Finally talking about movie it's just awesome can't express this movie helped me too get over her and given me a brilliant piece of advice. "" Love will find a way "". Thanks entire team of ""JWM"" for making this seminal masterpiece.. Love you guyz. Thanks a lot.."

Jab We Met,entertaining Indian screwball comedy powered by Kareena Kapoor,"In Jab We Met, a heartbroken guy meets a wacky, headstrong girl on a train who upends his life as she drags him into her adventures.

Kareena Kapoor is hilarious as the wacky girl. Her endless monologue to the guy is long-winded prattle that is both annoying and charming. She is the equivalent of characters like Katherine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby; a madcap who irritates and fascinates the guy she has swept into her tornado.

The movie bounces along effortlessly for the first couple of hours, with scenery, chemistry, and pleasant but generally forgettable musical interludes, but gets a little messy in the final third. Kapoor's actions go a little beyond wacky, a lot of very unlikely things happen, motivations seem arbitrary and it's all a reminder of why American screwball comedies stay well under 2 hours.

In spite of a shaky and somewhat peculiar (or just so Indian-specific that a westerner like me doesn't get it?) final hour, overall this is a charming, funny, and romantic movie well worth watching."

Jab We Met,Jab we never should have met,"This is one of the worst movies ever. I never thought Kareena could act so bad! Shahid will never be a man, he'll always remain a boy, no matter how often he tries to grow a beard. The boy has never acted. The leads lack chemistry. The supporting characters are annoying big time!

This is one sick waste of time and those pathetic critics who are praising it! Shame on them! It's as bad (if not worse) than Bull Bulaiyya. How could the director think that this will be called a good movie? The plot is obviously another Bollywood ripoff. Kareena should win worst actress for this. The songs are better forgotten. Why only the songs, the whole stupid film is better forgotten."
Jab We Met,Only Imtiaz can do it,"In 2007 Shahid and Kareena were very much in love, and anyone can feel that sparkling chemistry between them in this movie. In case of Imtiaz Ali, he always love to experiment with this kind of real life romantic bonds. Along with that he will always show his deep affectation of mountains and road trips in his movies like he did with this one. It will remain a classic romantic movie in the decades to come for its unique comedy and musics also."

Heaven Official's Blessing,Mine was love at first sight...,"Wow, I don't know if I can express my feelings for this masterpiece with words but I'll give it a try.

Heaven Official's Blessing, a.k.a Tian Guan Ci Fu, a.k.a. TGCF is my first ""donghua"" ever. I haven't heard of it before, hence I realised it was very reasonable I haven't heard it before cause appearently it's considerably something new.

I have a strange story about discovering it though. I had seen some pictures, fan arts on the internet of it and they were really great - so great that almost enchanted me. Then I kept seeing other arts too and I was really curious about what they were all about. Hands tight up in a red thread, floating lanterns everywhere, flying silver butterflies all around, a couple seem to be - very committed... I almost felt a strange connection to it, I was kinda hooked even before I saw it - just because of the arts. The power of art is such a strange thing, really...

Then I realised a couple of them were actual - official arts, concept arts for the donghua or from manhua. Then I decided to watch it and I knew I was gonna like it before I even started it.

I didn't just like but loved it. So yes, it was indeed love at first sight. The more I watch, the more I love it. I have never seen something this elegant before. The way of telling a story is also as much as important the plot itself. This show proves that again. Even after the first episode, I realised it had such a great story behind it. A story full of history of more than 800 years...

Luckily, I found it just right after the first season was finished. So I didn't had to wait for a new episode - not for a while at least. After seeing the whole show for three times, now I can say that this show can be a true masterpiece. The story is so deep that it is full of every emotion a person could have, even so much that it made me laugh and cry at the same time. The whole story of Xie Lian, the Crown Prince can be considered tragicomic. His past is like such a sad song, so captivative that you can't just stop to listen, but also admire its beauty. Then there is Hua Cheng, another sad story. And when you combine them, a more beautiful story takes the place...

I captivated by the story so much that I started to read the novel and I can say I haven't read a story that catches my heart this deeply for a long time. The characters are very detailed, one can understand the dreams, the happiness, the grief of every one of them. I can't help but relate with Xie Lian or Hua Cheng. I'm literally feeling like living in the story which is a great deal because I always had this saying: If I can feel like living in the story, if I can imagine the characters are living and enjoying their own universe, if I can think of them exist in somewhere out there... then it means it's a good story.

And this is one of the best stories I've ever seen.

The story is already good, the soundtracks are good, the art is good... I have such high hopes for this show.

About my 9 stars, I wanted to give it a 10, I even would like to give it 11 because that's how it made me feel. But the only trouble is about the animation. When I saw the opening, I thought I have never seen such a beautiful opening before, but after I saw some battle scenes... Well, they need to work on that part. But if the upcoming seasons will have a better animation, then I guess this show would be one of the best animations ever.

I only have one warning for those who are interested in watching it - this show is a BL so if you don't like that sort of thing, then consider your decision again. But if you are into BL stories, then don't wait, just jump in..."
Heaven Official's Blessing,Art. Action. Romance. Plot. Characters.,"The art is stunning in this donghua, and I adore the solid mix of action, romance, fantasy, and mystery. It can be minorly confusing at some points as you start to get into it, but I think it does an overall good job of explaining the characters, expanding their backgrounds, and building relationships all while furthering the plot.

Hua Cheng is all powerful in the most modest way possible. He's the type of character that has ALL the power and skill, but casually brushes it off and keeps moving with his absolute mess of a love interest, Xie Lian, a god who has been demoted all the way to the bottom ranks to collect scraps. For me, the main point of confusion is whether Xie Lian knows who Hua Cheng is for the first part of their story. He's obviously suspicious, but he seems somewhat oblivious as well. Then I get confused about whether he is keeping his own identity a secret because over time, that also becomes lax to the point of obvious.

Other than those minor details, this is an awesome show. I can't wait to see more after those wonderful action scenes, touching deaths, incredible introductions, past revelations, and budding relationships. I particularly like the adventure format that takes our characters to different areas with other tasks all while furthering their main plot and deepening ties. Watch this."
Heaven Official's Blessing,Beautiful in many ways,"Heaven Official's Blessing is my first donghua (chinese anime) that I've seen. It is such a beautiful show. I love the story, the different characters (especially the chemistry between Hua Cheng and Xie Lian is amazing) and so much more. Can't wait to see more of this!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,Beautiful,Absolutely beautiful animation and I love the story. Loved it so much that i'm starting to read the book!
Heaven Official's Blessing,Season 2!!!!,"PLEASE I am needing a season 2, 3 and so on. This show is so good!!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,Wow. Makes you want their love in real life,"Beyond beautiful. Romance was everything that I wanted. Their chemistry is precious, and their love is seen through their body language and motions.

You become incredibly wrapped up in their story, that nothing else will matter. Highly, highly recommended."
Heaven Official's Blessing,"Beautiful story, animations, and music. Top must see 2020-2021","Just recently watched it and I love it so much...that I watch every single one of these episodes again and again. Everything, from the stories to music to the animations and characters is all beautiful. Even though China has a bad review for this series, I hope this studio will continue it until the last chapter of its novel. It will be a big shame to waste such a beautiful story just because of what it represents: Love is love, no matter what you choose in life. Can't wait for the future upcoming seasons and episodes. For the directors, producers, publishers, and studio, please continue 'till the end, you have a lot of supporters here who love to see it until the very end. Finally, for the creator, thank you for creating this lovely story."
Heaven Official's Blessing,TGXF,Hmm... PERFECT! HUA CHENG 💗 XIE LIAN 💗💗💗💗💗💗
Heaven Official's Blessing,This is soooo great,Im just really curious about the way Hualian are gonna transform spiritual powers lol
Heaven Official's Blessing,"Taoist Theology, Beautiful Visuals, Gay Undertones, Strange Worlds","The review is for the Chinese language version.

The show presents the story in a setting that should be utterly foreign to most western audiences. In order to understand how the world in the story functions, one might want to brush up on Taoist Theology first. The show does not introduce the audience to the world of Taoist Theology. Instead, it immerses you in it assuming that you came prepared.

The story revolves around 2 immortals, one that is a ""deity"" (yang) and the other a ""demon"" (ying). The ""deity"" is of very low stature and twice banished from heaven for doing something that is right but offensive to other deities. In order to pay back his debts to other deities, he takes on difficult exorcism tasks to help people in the human realm. Along the way he meets the yin to his yang. And together they rid the human world of demons and lessen human suffering.

The art for the show was beautifully crafted, the story lines were pretty tight as well. The action sequences could be better, awkward split second pauses are found in the sequences that shouldn't be there. The story was interesting, but ultimately I found it empty because the characters are unrelatable. The story was interesting because it presented a mystery, but the characters are deities and demons, both immortals that behave in somewhat unrealistic yet predictable fashion. The show is worth the attention for the immersion in the world of Taoist theology, but ultimately came up short because it's very difficult to relate to."

Heaven Official's Blessing,Beautiful at but cringe worthy story and performance,"Great first impression. The artwork, character design, and music is very nice. Until the story starts to unfold and the voice acting starts it all falls apart. I watched the original Chinese version."
Heaven Official's Blessing,The first donghua that i really like it,"It's really deserve of your time to watch This donghua, and i'm already finished reading this novel too, i just really love with the story of san lang and xie lian"
Heaven Official's Blessing,Literally the BEST!!,"This was so good that I had to write a review! It made my heart do pitter-patters, I teared up, I laughed! It was just SO good. I 1000% recommend this! I liked it so much that I've started reading the manga as well, since I'm not patient enough to wait for season 2 of the show to come out! The first two episodes are slow starting, but I promise if you make it through those, you'll be hooked!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,beautiful story,"The storyline is certainly nicely done and interesting. in addition, the characters are well-built. the only thing, in my opinion, was that things were progressing too slowly, especially in the first several episodes, hence i lost patience lol. i forced myself through it because i was sure i was going to like it :p (i read the manhua and novel). regardless, i enjoyed it. looking forward to the special episode and the second season! the novel was EXTREMELY beautiful and amazing, so i hope this donghua continues to stay loyal to the novel's storyline and walk through it 'til the end. a must read for those who watched this donghua."
Heaven Official's Blessing,The most beautiful Chinese anime i ever saw,"This was the first Chinese anime i ever watched and to be honest it's my favorite. The characters and the plot are confusing at first but once you start to familiarize yourself with the whole thing it's absolutely gorgeous. The characters, art and music are unique and it's a true pleasure to watch them. I highly recommend this to anyone who want to try Chinese anime. If you want to find more about the story you can read the online novel or just search for the official manga(I'm telling you that manga is the most detailed thing i ever saw in my life. Every panel looks like a painting)"
Heaven Official's Blessing,"Stunning, one of the best animes in the genre","The adaptation is very consistent with the original novel and the animation is great. It is such a pleasure to watch and rewatch it. Can't wait for the second season!

The only negative side, it can be hard to understand everything for people who haven't read the novel, but comparing to other Chinese animes it's one of the easiest for understanding the plot."
Heaven Official's Blessing,"Powerful, delicate, truthful and anticipating.","I have only just started to get into Anime, and need to watch with sub-titles. This urges me to watch the series twice so I can not so focus on the words the second time round, but be able to watch the beautiful expressions on the characters faces. I loved this series so much, it truly deserves a 2nd and 3rd series. And I am sure there is enough back story from the writer to be able to create 10 seasons !

This is a must see animation. The critical themes, powerful fight sequences, deep questioning, history and most importantly the love between San Lang and Xie Lian is just insatiable. The humor, suggestion and stolen moments between them urge the viewer at the edge of their seat because we just want Xie Lian to realise exactly who San Lang is....beyond him being the demon king, but the absolute truth of this man. I was laughing, tearful, and in the end left hanging to know if the realisaiton had finally set into Xie Lian's heart. Does he run off, did San Lang made a decision to disappear for a long time or what?!!! Too many questions!!! I feel in my heart the undivided attention and sacrificial love that San Lang gives to Xie Lian is just to die for. Please dub an English version!!!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,Beautiful chinese anime adaptation,"This was unexpected in a good sense.

Production is very good. The drawings and the chinese characters during both the opening and the closing themes are especially outstanding (and the songs as well). The chibi sections are great. Music is atmospheric. Drawings and animations are ok.

The only caveat for me is the storyline. The often present irony and the action-adventure side of the anime help digest a plot where traditional chinese beliefs and legends, taoist ethics and escathology, war-heroes demigods reincarnated and male-male affection get mixed up. Quite original but - for me - also hard to feel really passionate about.

But give it a try! Hopefully the production will come up next with a story more appealing to my ""adult western taste""."
Heaven Official's Blessing,Excellent adaptation,This was an excellent adaptation of the book. The art work is excellent and it really captures the scenes of the book accurately. The characters are well drawn and look as you would imagine them. The chemistry between the leads are well illustrated. I can't wait for season 2!
Heaven Official's Blessing,Intriguing!,"The animation in this series is beautiful, especially with the intro! The complex folklore that follows as well is especially intriguing. However, the plot was a bit repetitive and some of the characters were a bit lackluster. Overall, there is a lot of actionable and interesting content in this previous Netflix series. This series makes me want to read the book and learn more about the fictional universe that the characters live in. There's a lot to learn and discover when watching this series and I hope that Netflix adds it again to their diverse selection of series. For now, feel free to check out the book!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,Good looking Characters but....,Good storyline but... The voices! Lack enthusiasm. Lacking of emotion. Voice actors did not execute Character's feelings and its tone - less..... Have you guys even watched & listened to how Japan's voice actors perfectly executed their Anime's characters? U can hear and FEEL what you're watching!
Heaven Official's Blessing,This animation is great!,"I've seen the first three episodes. Can't wait to see the next one. The storyline is great! The characters are so funny! I love the music. After seen the first three episodes, I start to read the original novel. Hope this animation will loyal to the original version, which is by far the best story I've read this year!"
Heaven Official's Blessing,masterpiece,"I love love love this show!! It's so beautiful, the characters, animation everything is well done!! The relationships too."
Ugly Delicious,Great show about food.. and politics.,"I'm going to start by saying that those who complaint about the amount of political debates in the show, most probably is because they don't agree with Chang's position. But I do... Food is by far, the greatest way to represent a culture, and how much we value some food reflects perfectly how we value the culture behind it. And maybe it's about time that people in the states understand that all this food they like and often consider as their own, comes from cultures such as mexican, chinese, and black people, that deserves to be respected as well. I'm a huge fan of Chang since Mind of a Chef, he is very honest and is not afraid of having uncomfortable conversations, and racism in the food industry is one of those. That being said, the show is great: casual conversations among friends and experts, lots of delicious food, and a beautiful effort of showing that the greatest food of all is not in the expensive, elitist restaurants, but the one you share with your loved ones and is cooked with intention and feeling."
Ugly Delicious,Iconoclastic on purpose,"I enjoy Chang's stance against culinary orthodoxy, even if I don't always agree with it. He equates it with rigidity, and there is some truth to that, when you have some self-styled institute in Naples deciding what is and is not pizza, or things like those ultra-stuffy French contests. But there is value in keeping traditions and maintaining the purity, if you will, of certain foods just because they're really good. You can also still have fusions and crossover, but not everyone has to be busting through the old way to be appreciated. There is something deeply satisfying about, say, a traditional shrimp etouffe or cheese blintz or Peking duck.

I do not at all understand the complaints about it being too political. The history of different foods is to some extent the story of the cultures who make that food. And sometimes those cultures clash. I found it fascinating that he was riding around on the white guys' boats when the Vietnamese shrimpers started working in the Gulf coast. I'm guessing most of the complaints about it being political came from white people, because they get nervous talking about race. But when you're talking to Asians who came to the US, part of the experience that forms the food they serve is how they were received in the US, and how subsequent generations view the situation. For an Asian-American, race is always a thing. He's dealing with his and others' reality. Food is deeply ethnic.

One last thing: I love the music choices. Very cool."
Ugly Delicious,Well worth the time,"Enjoyed the show and the commentary, but David Chang is so opinionated as a person- just don't like his personality- that it takes away from the show."
Ugly Delicious,Thought provoking and unlike any other food show!,"I enjoyed David Chang's new show. It was highly original and entertaining. Sometimes in shoes like this there is a certain point where I get bored. I think he knows that and pokes fun at food shows where they get too over the top on describing food.

This series is called Ugly Delicious because it challenges conventional norms about what is good food. I highly recommend this series and the arguments that David is bringing to the forefront of conversations in North America."
Ugly Delicious,Raises the bar!!,"I am blown away by Ugly Delicious. I've finished season 1 and can't wait for a season 2.

Each show focuses on a single food item or topic and David Chang travels America and the world exploring it, discussing its history, it's rise and development.

For example, the episode on fried chicken wasn't content to just show David Chang eating some fried chicken but he dives into the history of it, teaches us why it's a racial food and why some people won't be seen in public ordering it. I had no idea. I just thought it was delicious. The episode on Chinese food, discusses why Chinese American food is completely different than the food in China and how western tastes are coming to change over time.

This is a far cry from a typical food show that just glorifies a few chefs or is endless shots of food porn. Give it a watch!"
Ugly Delicious,Hungry viewing,"I loved this show. The fist 6 episodes were great, though the last 2 were less so. In particular I thought the episodes on pizza, BBQ, Viet-cajun, and fried chicken were excellent. I liked that this was not a cooking show - that it was about what food means and about some of the best, most iconic examples of the subject food without getting lost in a Gino's vs Pat's type debate."
Ugly Delicious,See how powerful food truly is,"I am an amateur home cook with a strong fetish for cooking shows and shows about food and in my opinion this show is one of the best I have ever seen. I love how it explores dishes and topics from a vast array of perspectives, I love how honest it is and I admire how open David change is. I always believed food is one of the most powerful things on earth and this show is both a prof and an explanation to that. Cant wait for Se 2!"

Ugly Delicious,Good food show... stretching race comments,Comentario no disponible
Ugly Delicious,Absolutely perfect!,"Due to Netflix I am sure that David is getting a global audience, which is great. All the places he and his crew visit to find the perfect food is fantastic, the in depth commentairy about the topics are insanely well done as well. Almost a 10/10 for me, giving it just 1 minus point. This is for the 'racial' topic, something that is truely an american thing. Not that this does not need to be mentioned, it just does not need to come back that much. It is a topic for a whole different kind of documentairy. Besides that, I am greatly looking forward to Season 2."
Ugly Delicious,Mutual admiration between Meehan & Chang,"First of it starts out great, they are talking about the overall arch. ""UGLY food that is DELICIOUS""... But this is maybe in the 3 first episodes but then the show is about the mutual admiration betweem the main characters.

I've always loved Chang, but this feels like his first season of ""mind of a chef"". Almost the same persons as well. Is Mehaan out of ideas regarding presenting Chang as the great chef as he is?

I thought this show was going to be about what Chang has posted on instagram. Those lovely / ugly pots that probably taste super delicious. How he cooks them and the history about them where he learnt etc.

I mean, the pizza episode is great! but pizza isnt ugly. The vietcajun are awesome and same with fried chicken & dumplings. But those meals are not ugly. Those plates are good looking and for sure delicious.

Wrong title, too much admiration for Chang (we know he is one of the G.O.A.T.S).

Anyhow, it is really viewable and it appriciate but it is just that I wanted more from it.... not to get tricked. (sorry for my english, not my native language)."
Ugly Delicious,"I want to like this, but . . .","I want to like this, I really do, but why does so much of this need to be about race. I have no problem discussing the origins and what the food means to that particular ethnicity, but this goes way too far. I'm white and I felt so much unneeded guilt. They completely broad brush that every white person thinks and acts the same way and does not appreciate Asian culture and thinks the food is weird. They say Americans will not eat traditional Asian food, but that doesn't make them hate a culture or ethnicity. It just makes them human and their culture is not used to that type of food.

And David Chang makes himself a complete hypocrite when he says it ""pisses him off"" when White people say they like Chinese Food, but have never had traditional Chinese food. Skip 5 mins and he is talking to a WHITE Chinese food expert in China. She has him try traditional Chinese food and he spits it out right in front of the chef who prepared it. WTF!?"
Ugly Delicious,A show that holds its voice in many voices.,"When it comes to reality television, the genre that always has interested me the most is food and travel. What I've always liked about the genre is it's ability to represent a culture and take me to a place I've never been, as well as introducing me to something I've never experienced before. Duh, right? Food TV has begun to represent the tastes (pun intended) of every reality television demographic, with different moods and personalities for each audience. But all of these suffer from usually one of two things: these shows are either boiled down to a basic, mainstream view of the culture and cuisine that is mainly targeted towards white middle aged moms and their children (think any show on TLC and a majority of the Food Network), or is aimed at a demographic that believes itself to be superior in taste with a level of pretension that either insults the culture that is engaging itself in or inserts an equally insulting level of appropriation. God forbid they end up doing both. The closest thing I've seen to breaking this mold was Anthony Bourdain's television efforts, and up until now, his entries were my favorites. But even then, these shows were coming from a white, upper class, gourmet male chef's point of view. No matter how much of a ""cool dad"" aesthetic Bourdain put on, he's still experiencing culture from a point of view that is entirely privileged. Until recently, Bourdain was the only celebrity chef host that was permeating the genre to a mainstream audience, whilst keeping himself mostly unpretentious (although his attempts to do this could very well unintentionally land him in the very direction he was clearly avoiding.) Then enter the new Netflix series from chef David Chang, Ugly Delicious. Ugly Delicious is a show that focuses on a different type of food each episode, dissecting the individual food's culture, its representation, its roots and history, and the reflections of it from various individuals. David Chang brings a new view that is unique to him particularly as a Korean-American chef, and his background and history is referenced frequently. Each episode of the show feels like it's own documentary, about Chang and his personal relationship with a different kind of food or tradition. Now, this isn't anything extraordinarily different. What is different, however, is that this show is not about David Chang experiencing food and culture exclusively. Alongside Chang is a revolving door of casually introduced food-world individuals; Restaurateurs, chefs, food critics, food journalists, cookbook authors, and even actors with a personal connection to the food that they're experiencing. This keeps the show incredibly interesting. Nearly none of these people (besides a brief appearance from Jimmy Kimmel and arguably Eric Wareheim and Aziz Ansari) are talking heads whom you've seen a thousands times before. These are all people who know their stuff because they're actively working on it away from television. This is what keeps the show from approaching the mainstream baseline that the Guy Fieri's of the food tv world so frequently engage in. What's more, there is a story to each episode that makes it unique from every other show of its kind. We jump between different times in Chang's food journey, varying between different company members, and even occasionally omitting Chang entirely. This show is about people, and about food, but does not focus on one or the other exclusively. Here's an example: In the first episode of the show, the Pizza episode, which is my personal favorite, we open to Chang and longtime friend and food writer Peter Meehan observing pizza chef Mark Ianco at his Brooklyn Pizza Lucali, talking about pizza and Ianco's personal craft, to then talking about pizza as a conceptual whole-what makes pizza authentic, what makes pizza, ""pizza""?. But then we begin jumping around to different settings and stories. We see Chang and actor Aziz Ansari trying a unique japanese pizza, discussing the culture of japanese cuisine and what is fusion. This continues on the theme of what authenticity is when it comes to pizza and food as a whole, and continues into the following segments: Ianco trying Connecticut pizza for the first time, Meehan and Ianco visiting traditional and conventional Neapolitan pizza restaurants in Naples, Italy, Attilio Bachetti, of one of the oldest pizza kitchens in Naples talking about their tradition and techniques, a charming animated segment about all the ways to fold and eat pizza, Chang visiting Wolfgang Puck talking about his pizza and his freezing of it, Meehan and Ianco observing an italian mozzarella making process, Chang talking to Norwegian/Italian chef Christian Francesco Puglisi about his process and cultural background, trash food writer Walter Green attending a commercial pizza convention, Chang visiting a Domino's location and observing their process to then adouring the blue uniform himself and making deliveries. That is a lot of different content to fit into a fifty minute episode, and each of these segments is woven into each other, coming back anywhere between two to four times, all the while talking about what it is to be authentic, with various ideas presented throughout in a very conversational way that ranges from calmly neutral to incredibly aggressive. To a frequent food and travel television viewer, this approach is extremely refreshing, as it defies the convention of what food and travel TV is, and blends them both incredibly. It's not just about Pizza, and it's not just about New York, or Naples, or anywhere else Pizza is produced- it's about both. All the while doing so in a tone that doesn't avoid pretension specifically, but naturally dips in and out of it, leaving the show with not just one identity or voice, but many. Many of these people come from places of success and privilege, and some of them aren't even entirely aware of it at times, but this adds another layer to its tone. Whether its Chang cooking traditional ""white people"" Thanksgiving food alongside his Korean mother whilst she cooks Korean, interviewing restaurant chefs on cooking at home, debating on dumplings vs pasta, eating Donkey in china, ordering Taco Bell in car full of food critics, or in what is my favorite scene from the entire series, talking about Asian Americans making themselves more prominent publically with Steven Yeun, the curtain is being pulled back in many ways that we've never seen before in this kind of TV. The individuals who become mouthpieces for the discussion shape it, but they all think rather differently, and while Chang is always a voice in each episode, talking about almost all foods from an Asian American approach, he's not always the primary one, so different views are always being represented. You'd think by doing all this at once the show would be unfocused and even hard to follow, but it's actually quite opposite, being very organized, and cohesive, without ever becoming boring. Visually, the show ranges from creative, colorful, and cinematic, to pretty standard jump cuts and average doc shots that don't reach very far beyond the genre's standard. Each episode has an entirely unique introduction, many of them very cinematic and enjoyable, but sometimes have very little to do with the particular topic the episode is addressing. Some intros flair simply lies in the editing, going for very little further than the bear minimum of an introduction. Some episodes also have informative animated segments that never really feel to have any continuity between episodes, which I think is kind of the point, but this is never explored to its full potential. Much like Anthony Bourdain's productions, each episode of Ugly Delicious has its own thesis layden throughout, which almost always has to do with cultural, racial, and political history. This is the shows biggest strength, and also, its only true weakness. In watching this show, we very quickly learn that David Chang is both progressive and aggressive in his standing by his opinions. Whether it's all but berating a vietnamese New Orleans chef to cook VietCajun food in an area of the country that clings to its food traditions without question, or his asserting his views on working and immigration while in the home of an Vietnamese immigrant chef who believes in long term, vetted immigration, we see that Chang stands by his views that both food and politics should be continually moving and changing. But we also see that he does have a reverence and appreciation for long standing tradition in both respects. While I personally agree with Chang's approach, and what he says about it, I don't think the show ever tries particularly hard to reach an answer; sometimes leaving us floating with no real conclusion, whilst other times it belabors its point. I'm not saying I want to be told what the right thought is- we have Bourdain for that- but there's definitely something here that is extremely interesting and intriguing, but isn't bringing us far enough. Again, we see really good, unique ideas being brought forward, but they're not always explored fully. The show is defying convention, but occasionally stops halfway when it gets tired and relies on the crutches of that convention again. Hopefully, we can see these ideas pushed further in a second season, and really bridge this slight gap in the show. Overall, I really, really enjoy the this first season of Ugly Delicious, and hope to be able to see more. The direction in this show is incredibly refreshing, and is proving again that while you can't reinvent the wheel, you can still modify it. What David Chang has done is brought forth something that all travel and food audiences can nearly unanimously appreciate- something that isn't quite artsy, and yet not quite undignified. Ugly Delicious has a voice in that it is made of many voices, with many different views and backgrounds- and honestly, isn't that something we could use more of right now? 9.2/10"
Ugly Delicious,Loved it,This was more than a food show. I like the host David Chang as he was fearless in asking the right questions or calling people food snobs e.g ordering dominos to an italian pizzeria. What a great idea. I hate food snobs. I loved how they detailed the history behind food e.g fried chicken or the vietamese shrimpers. More seasons please!
Ugly Delicious,Form your own opinion. It might not be for you,Comentario no disponible
Ugly Delicious,It is a great show,"Its beyond your taste buds. It is a history lesson in foods from across the world, said honestly and bluntly. Egypt btw is part of Africa not the middle East. Amazing episodes, really insightful."
Ugly Delicious,"Finish your storytelling, Chef!!","I love this show minus the storytelling. David Chang and guests never seem to finish their thoughts on subjects. Maybe this is due to poor editing or directing, I'm not sure, but it irritates me to know I'm missing that one elemental moment of truth. I wanted to understand what Indians truly thought about American Indian food but they never showed it minus what they felt about yoga. Otherwise, this show is very lighthearted and very interesting to watch."
Ugly Delicious,At last someone said it.,"What David Chang did here was on a lot of people's mind for a long time but they hesitated to say it out loud for various reasons. Selective appreciation of some food cultures is so wrong and what it does is diminish other food cultures. For some reason stupid people start flowing ""trends"" in food and lose their originality. ""Follow the food"" you may say but ""trends"" change what people eat and the distinction of this food is classier than that is wrong and a lot of food cultures die because people stop eating it as it is not considered ""fine dining"". Food, of all things is an individual's representation of all his/her living years. It shouldn't be judged by the way it looks. As he rightly said, people should stop charging for food by the way it looks but by the way it tastes. Flavors are a living testament to how rich a culture is and how it evolved feeding billions of people. (Rich or poor) food is for everyone."
Ugly Delicious,Unique Perspective on Food,"David Chang's attempt at detangling complex food mysteries can be a hit or a miss based on who the watcher is. You cannot go into this show expecting to be see the how/where/what of the food item or cuisine type or how you can cook it or the history of the food itself instead the show is a commentary from David Chang, his conversations with friends fellow celebrities what not, about a particular or general food type or item and they go wherever their conversations take them. Chang's character itself is as real and authentic as one can be but he's not a charming intelligent critic like Anthony Bourdain. So watch Chang & Company's Food Adventures at your own risk."
Ugly Delicious,An objective take on food and a challenge to what good food actually is...,"The idea that David (and team) tries to push with this series is that good food does not always mean expensive or fancy. He has no problem doing the unheard of and bringing chain pizza restaurants in the mix of a discussion. He sets the low bar, the high bar and your every day level of cuisine in each topic. It's about culture as much as food with a little light hearted humor thrown in with short skits seemingly picked out of thin air and as much thought, but it's creative and that's why it's important.

A memorable episode about his mother's home cooking really shows who he is as a person.

People who love american chinese food may be slightly annoyed at the episode highlight how it is actually terrible and not what anyone living the chinese culture would seek. If that surprises you, you're likely a white american, plain and simple just like me. This is meant to make you think of what chinese culture is and not what you have been hand fed because it's what ""we"" as americans will open our wallets, purchase, and eat.

I love the show, I love the ideas of culture enlightening and pushing one's boundaries to find a more true experience through food."
Ugly Delicious,Uneven,Comentario no disponible
Ugly Delicious,Mixed message,"I guess my complaint can be highlighted by two episodes: The first is about pizza. It frames the series showing us what is perfect about pizza, what a risk taker can do with pizza, what a perfectionist can do with pizza and what a corporation can do with pizza. It shows how even the Americanized version Domino's makes has some value because of a connection to our childhood or maybe just events in our life. How some food can be ugly and delicious, there's value in all cuisine and you shouldn't look down your nose at something just because you can order it on an app.

The second is the episode about Chinese food. It is a celebration of Chinese food and Asian culture. It puts down, and puts down hard, American Chinese food and highlights the reason why Chinese food will never be big here: It has to be eaten by white mouths. They highlight why Chinese food is the way it is over here (a lot of oppression and immigration bans) and tells the tale of a ruined art. Now, I understand that there is anger there because Chinese food is delicious and they want it represented over here but it doesn't fit with the statement made in the first episode.

I guess I didn't like it because it didn't fit tonally. It turned into a celebration of Asian cuisine, which is awesome, but it strayed away from what I took as the message of the series: not all food has to be pretty, not all food has to be perfect. I think if it just wanted to be a show about Asian cuisine you should just call it Delicious and go nuts. I'd watch that show."
Ugly Delicious,Great show!,I would have given him a 10 If chef Chang was a little bit more open minded. I get it he is proud of his roots but his comments about even a taco was Asian was a little annoying but still love him and his show and his cooking
Ugly Delicious,Stop with the snowflakes... I like the bluntness and truthfulness of the cast.,"Just want to say for people saying it's so political or turned off by the swearing... Give me a break. Go watch some twisted version of Truman Show that just caters to your palates.

Although some of the comments that the cast says may be ""offensive"" to some, I think this creates an opportunity for dialogue and thinking. It brings people from many different upbringings and culture together to discuss a single theme -- food. You get to see what kind of opinions and thoughts these people have, and at times see that even the most famous chefs have very opposing views.

Would recommend."

So many cringe moments, the f-bomb was used so often, casually! It was great to see Lily Tomlin, in updated mode. I loved seeing Loni Anderson as blast from past rarely seen and still hot. Billy Crystal I think had best bit, deserving to be there!

Last they made Neal Patrick Harris (way to much % of screen time) (irony since had cancelled variety show) pretty much the host along with Tiffany Haddish (vulgar beyond) All in all, this was a disgrace to Laugh-In, Sad the very elderly creator was there, took it all in happily. 4/10 being not LOL generous."

Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,Wow...,"Just unwatchable, imo. I will watch and enjoy everything from Laurel & Hardy to Big Bang Theory, but couldn't get through 20 minutes of this. Pay tribute to the greats who came before, as we should, but redoing their acts POORLY is such a disservice."
Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,What an insult to a true classic!,"I grew up watching Rowen & Martin's Laugh-in. To this day I still find its humor funny, if dated. The show really did break new ground and introduced comedy routines people today can still relate to.

But in its attempt to (ahem) ""honor"" this classic show, Hollywood managed only to disgrace the original. Updating some of their more famous skits (such as the Joke Wall, the Party, the Dirty Old Man On the Park Bench) they used a large all-star cast of current celebrities. But to anyone who actually watched the original show it was downright painful! The jokes fell flat and were poorly-delivered...and acted. And updating them to reflect today's politically-correct culture severed any true connection they were meant to have with the '60s version.

And finally, if there was any doubt about this show's leftist agenda you need only stay to near the end (I barely made it there myself), when Bill Maher reenacted the classic Flying Fickle Finger Of Fate Award, presenting it to...wait for it...President Trump.

Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,Mix of the Old and the New...,"In a tribute to Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, it was a mix of old clips and today's talent paying homage to the original. The show was, also, a comedic reminder that ""what comes around goes around"" as what was occurring then in the U.S. and the world is relevant, now, again. It's a show that doesn't take itself too seriously (while being insanely serious), isn't politically correct, and only panders to itself - if you can't handle any of this, you won't enjoy it, otherwise, you'll find it funny."
Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,The best parts were the original clips,"Despite the big name actors in the new segments, the new material was not so funny. And this was too much of a venue in which Netflix was working overtime to bash President Trump. Disgraceful and not funny. Johnny Carson is famously quoted as saying that politics has no place in good comedy. And if you watch Bob Hope's specials you will see the same political gracefulness, meaning that good comedy can get the viewer to laugh at the joke without the joke insulting its subject."
Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,Nostalgic,I enjoyed this tribute. It brought back some great memories and some modern takes on the classic. Clearly Laugh-in was way ahead of its time in its political commentary and the way it featured women in comedy. Folks that are canning this celebration need to chill. It was not a perfect tribute but it is certainly enjoyable.
Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,Sad homage to the original,Right from the start Tiffany Haddish was horrible. She is not funny or talented in any way shape or form. The other actually talented people seemed off and their deliveries of the jokes landed way off mark. Even Billy Crystal wasn't himself.
Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,Sad just sad,"Laugh in was the very definition of cutting edge, so much so that in hindsight it 8s hard to understand. This special just proves the point.

The writers have no clue why it was funny in the first place. Inter cutting new jokes with the old jokes just shows that the current writers couldn't clean the ash trays of their predecessors.

This hour was so disappointing. Laugh-In was successful because it was funny to everyone, even me at 12 years old even though I didn't get all the jokes. I feel sorry for kids today who are being indoctrinated by popular television that tells them how to think, vote, and swear unabashedly."

Still Laugh-In: The Stars Celebrate,"It's a piece of comedy history, remembered.","It's fun to watch comedians pay homage to a show and the people that inspired them. It reminds us of how things have AND haven't changed. Some reviewers are saying they didn't think it was funny. That's their opinion. Like ear holes, most everybody has them. Check it out for yourself. Look at this piece of television and comedy history. Learn why it had such an impact. This is in the vein of In Living Color, Mad TV, Saturday Night Live, or The Carol Burnett Show. This is a coming together of talent in a time when people. Needed a laugh. Which is no different than today. Or downvote. Get angry. Be outraged. It's your business and I'm not your supervisor.

People seem proud to claim how aware they are now, so why does it get harder to do comedy like this? Because we've grown MORE sensitive about the issues. The issues have changed and most comedy is a product of its time. Celebrate the fun the show, it's writers and performers had poking at everything they could get their hands on. I watched reruns of Laugh-in as a kid. It made me laugh. I did t get all the jokes then. They make more sense now. Saying that the profanity feels like a miss is interesting. While I agree that better writing overcomes the need to shoot for the extra impact that profanity attempts to provide, this felt more like what Laugh-in might have been like if it was produced today, without television's censors.

I take this for what it is: a look back at a treasured and appreciated show. An experiment that went sorta right and made people laugh a lot. Don't overthink it. Maybe it's worth exploring before making a snap judgement. For me, I laughed. I smiled. I remembered... and enjoyed."

The IT Crowd,Just awesome,I have nothing further to say - the last hour was simply amazing because of this.

The IT Crowd,"It's a piece of comedy history, remembered.","It's fun to watch comedians pay homage to a show and the people that inspired them. It reminds us of how things have AND haven't changed. Some reviewers are saying they didn't think it was funny. That's their opinion. Like ear holes, most everybody has them. Check it out for yourself. Look at this piece of television and comedy history. Learn why it had such an impact. This is in the vein of In Living Color, Mad TV, Saturday Night Live, or The Carol Burnett Show. This is a coming together of talent in a time when people. Needed a laugh. Which is no different than today. Or downvote. Get angry. Be outraged. It's your business and I'm not your supervisor.

People seem proud to claim how aware they are now, so why does it get harder to do comedy like this? Because we've grown MORE sensitive about the issues. The issues have changed and most comedy is a product of its time. Celebrate the fun the show, it's writers and performers had poking at everything they could get their hands on. I watched reruns of Laugh-in as a kid. It made me laugh. I did t get all the jokes then. They make more sense now. Saying that the profanity feels like a miss is interesting. While I agree that better writing overcomes the need to shoot for the extra impact that profanity attempts to provide, this felt more like what Laugh-in might have been like if it was produced today, without television's censors.

I take this for what it is: a look back at a treasured and appreciated show. An experiment that went sorta right and made people laugh a lot. Don't overthink it. Maybe it's worth exploring before making a snap judgement. For me, I laughed. I smiled. I remembered... and enjoyed."
Superwog,Loved it!,"Had me laughing out loud in places - love the outtakes at the end too! It won't be to everyone's taste but if you like The Young Offenders or Stath lets flats, give it a go."
Superwog,Right amount and type of comedy,Comentario no disponible
Superwog,It's a tough call,"This really is the proverbial trainwreck, can't turn away. Certainly unique. That said I will continue watching it."
Superwog,This is a hidden gem,"I woke up around 2AM, figured I'd smoke a little to try and go back to sleep. Decided to search for something funny, thinking a drama might keep me awake. I don't even know how long I searched before coming across this. OMG, I love it!! It's so stupid and funny! The outtakes after each episode are stellar. Watching these boys trying to keep a straight face while filming is amazing! It's goofy as hell, but it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not!! It's an inexpensive, skit comedy show and it really hit the spot for me. I'm so happy I came across this! I ended up binging both seasons. I'm so happy these brothers are successful doing something they love. Thank you for this hidden little gem."
Superwog,Hilarious is an understatement,Now this is a fun watch. The guys are brilliant with their different characters and the storyline is absolutely hilarious. It's a relaxed show to watch when you want to unwind after a long day at work. Definitely made me laugh so hard and I wish those guys get a chance to do more of it or other productions soon. Absolutely smart and brilliant.
Superwog,Sooo funny!,"I absolutely love this show, it is so funny although there is a lot of swearing and a lot of sexual references. Overall great show!"
Superwog,Unique and funny.,"I rate shows quite harshly, and have never given a ten. Eights and nines are reserved for top quality productions, and sevens are great shows, but if toilet humour is leaned on heavily, a seven is the best the show can hope for.

Superwog, or as Netflix has named it Superbro, is a silly, funny, outrageous tv show taking place in suburban Australia. Two people act in multiple roles to great comedic effect. The character of the father is my personal favourite, but all the characters play off each other and the show is generally very funny, and uses misfortune as a key plot driver.

I found the show illuminating as it exposes a little bit of Australian suburban life to foreign audiences. The writers have talent and can play their roles to perfection. A solid 7."
Superwog,What a good show.,"I watched superwog on YouTube for a long time then saw that it was releasing on Netflix, and the series is amazing! The Lump is my personal favourite episode."
Superwog,"Stick with it, if only for the credit bloopers",Comentario no disponible
Superwog,Seriously?,"Sorta high school level humour. Does it improve? I guess it has better ratings because it's "" ethnic "" , but nothing is actually good."
Superwog,Love it,Best miniseries since Friends! The next episodes don't cone quickly enough.
Superwog,Funniest show you've seen in last 5 years,"This is comedy. Hilarious, original, and visceral. Probably the best depiction of unintended parentally inflicted trauma on screen. Also a display of how ungrateful the millennial/post millennial generation can be. Easy to absorb because the viewer can see how rooted this humor is in reality; even through the farcical extremes. An absolute much watch. This viewer wants to see more. Visual comic art. Captures the nuances of familial craziness making it universal although somehow being quite specific. A refreshing change from overarching into the shocking but shocks in a way that is unexpected in a world of content that seems to do eat thing for a laugh. A return to reality humor. BRAVO!"
Superwog,Bloody Brilliant,"Fair Dinkum mate, this has to be the best show I've ever watched. Leaves me smiling dead sheep every time I watch."
Superwog,Phenomenal work,I've been watching superwog since I was in high school Prince First videos two now that there's a series I've lived in both Australia and the United States served in the military and have consistently throughout those years gone back to watch these guys and every time I watch them I'm consistently laughing just hysterically because it's a lot of similarities in the wall lifestyle that they bring up they might make it a little over the top but that's just what makes it hilarious because you can think of a Time that are Greek parent would do something like this anybody have shown superwog has just left consistently as well just out of control I see superwog being the Australian Tyler Perry and hopefully a movie will come out with them one day
Superwog,Great,IT'S SO GOOD AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THEGUSK REVIEW SUCK MONKEY FEET.
Superwog,Incredible show.,"One of the most Australian shows, and one of the most comedic. The two brothers have amazing chemistry and it makes the show hundreds of times better."
Superwog,CLASS SHOW,Everything about this show is amazing the father in this tv show is hilarious makes me laugh all the time and yes overall just loved this show 10/10 for me.
Superwog,Best comedy show ever,Comentario no disponible
Superwog,Fantastic show,Really enjoyed this show. Good acting and funny as f.
Superwog,Very funny ...,"Great characters, really funny ... hope they make a lot more. This is Australian comedy at it's finest ... if you're American, it may not be for you. As a Brit, absolutely hilarious !!"
Superwog,Mate,"This is a great TV show that has unpredictable turns, and that finally, amazing and creative."
Superwog,Charming,As good as all the racial stereotype shows put together.
Superwog,First time laughing uncontrollably in years,"I remember laughing at jokes uncontrollably, when I was younger. For some 5-7 years I haven't laughed like that at anything, before I saw Superbro on Netflix at 37 years old. The guys are great and despite any issue others would critisize this for, Superbro achieves its main objective - it is actually FUNNY.

Some of the highlights are the characters the brothers create - the arabic lady (the mother) is the best - her reactions, mannerisms and speech. The Australian woman is also very funny. Then there is the dad - the shorter brother is an amazing actor as well. There is Barry. The ethnic and cultural differences are exploited beautifully."
Superwog,Stupid yet epic Comedy GOLD,"Every charector, every episode makes you laugh your a off! Trust me you guys need to what's this. They deserve many more seasons. Please keep em coming. 2 main leads are a class act. Comedy gold. They inact most of the charectors and honestly they nail it. In this day of cultural correctness and people being so fragile i actually though such shows are not possible to be made. But here it is. You can leave your brain in the corner and enjoy this show and laugh. It will become your guilty pleasure. Wish them all the very best. Netflix picked them up which was a surprise. I hope they don't cancel them. Pray for them so that these kind of shows can still be made."
Superwog,Ultra cringe fest but some real LOL moments,"'Superwog' (or 'Superbro', as it branded here in the UK, due to the negative racist connotations associated with the the original title) kind of reminds me of the UK comedy series 'The Inbeetweeners' but with a much faster pace. Almost like the Aussie version of 'The Inbeweeners' crossed with the USA comedy 'Workaholics' but all of main the characters are played by the same 2 actors and the characters all have ADHD. The type of comedy that most likely only appeals to younger generations, there is no clever wit in the jokes and some really cringey moments but like the aforementioned comedies this series comes full swing with its hilarity and whacky jokes."
The House Arrest of Us,,
Raajneeti,"Politics, Corruption, Skullduggery: An Entertaining Hybrid","If this were a typical Hollywood political thriller, it would be clear which folks were the nasty ones and which were the heroes. If this were a typical Bollywood film, there would be plenty of dancing and the usual generational conflicts. But Raajneeti is neither; surely it is a political thriller, but because it upends expectations, some viewers are disappointed it doesn't deliver what they expect. Granted, it might be a richer film from Westerners if they were more familiar with the complexities of politics in another country, but if you approach this film for what it is--a political thriller with a heavy dollop of family melodrama and a good deal of violence, adding numerous rich characterizations and brilliant color, you might find it hugely entertaining"
Raajneeti,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A spineless saga of political corruption,"The Hindi cinema over the years has produced a plethora of timeless gems, which not only entertained the masses, but also awed the critics with their originality, poignance, austerity and occasional grandeur. Today, the Hindi cinema has become a mere impression of what it used to be in its decorated days.

Rajneeti is a mere continuation of the long chain of over hyped run-of-the- mill movies, which lack both originality and substance. The ever meticulous and uncanny Prakash Jha fails to leave any mark on the movie, which is a mere mishmash of weak dialogues, trite sub-slots, incongruities, and incompetency in editing and to some extent in direction. Jha fallibly blends the epic tale of the Mahabharata with that of the Godfather in Rajneeti. Jha missed yet another trick by failing to acknowledge and avow to the fact that Rajneeti was meant to be an adaptation of the Mahabharata.

The stellar cast of the movie somehow manages to give it a much needed impetus. The acting is commendable with a special mention of Manoj Vajpayee, Nana Patekar and Arjun Rampal. The cinematography, sound editing & mixing are also up to the mark. The movie, though marred by the aforementioned inconsistencies is definitely worth a watch if the viewer overlooks the banalities of the plot and its conspicuous similarities to the Mahabharata and the Godfather trilogy.

PS: Rajneeti can definitely serve to be a guilty pleasure to the less eclectic viewers and for those whose sole purpose is entertainment. 6.5/10

Raajneeti,epic Mahabharata meets godfather.,"I watched this movie last night. it was not planned but somehow i just went as some of my friends are big Prakash Jha fan. the movie started with some promise and it looked OK to me and my friends were more than happy the way it turned out. BUT i had my fears as it was turning out to be pretty much like godfather and the moment ranbir kapoor is slapped by the policemen that was the moment i was completely put off - HOW many times we see the same things. it was with sarkar too. abhisek bachchan in sarkar and ranbir kappor in rajneeti is all the same to me - trying to do a Al pacino. If that was not enough they brought in complete Mahabharata which was still good.

over all the movie is good, better than other releases but what was the point of bringing in Mahabharata and godfather in it. it could have been lot better in its own way but it didn't."
Raajneeti,A multi-starer to the core,"Even if you do not know before going into the movie, it is evident in the first few minutes that the film draws heavily from the epic of Mahabharata. From the basic plot to the characters. Your palms will get sweaty a few times if you can relate to it.

Ranbir Kapoor is our modern day Arjun & Krishna woven into one. All characters in the movie have shades of gray and Ranbir is no exception. He is a strategist who is not afraid to go the bloody mile. Being a young actor in a multi starer can be tricky, but Ranbir does emerge on top, thereby setting the pace for more serious & deeper roles in the future. Nana Patekar is so subtle & understated that he takes the film forward effortlessly. No yelling, just shrewd smiles. Ajay Devgn proves yet again that he is past the stage where he needs screen time to justify his role. He easily enters into the skin of the modern day Karna, letting Manoj Bajpai as Duryodhan take center stage. And Bajpai, justifies every minute of his presence on screen. Arjun Rampal has his moments in the sun. Katrina impresses mainly through her improved Hindi. This is definitely not the role that she was hoping would get her a national award.

Subtlety is not a mark of Prakash Jha's cinema. From Gangajal to Apaharan to Raajneeti, all are in your face dramas. Raajneeti, if I may say, would be his most commercial outing in some time. We have very mainstream actors, a grand scale in the sheer number of crowds, bloody violence, cars going up in flames & people killing each other left, right & center.

Even for its 3 hour run time, some scenes & sequences do seem rushed in a bit. Nasserudin Shah has as much a presence in the film as he has on the posters. He is not in the film if you are five minutes late to the movie. All our political men are ultra virile & the females- ultra fertile. There is also a needless club song. Then, there are car bombs & a climactic gun battle that is a bit over the top just like all Prakash Jha films. It could have been kept tighter & more believable.

But that said, the film is a gripping tale with very intensely executed pieces and careful attention to detail. The basic premise remains that of the Mahabharata, but the film is not limited to that. It is fast paced and there is seldom a loose moment. It is not Jha's best work, not even close. But I am tempted to rate it highly for the power packed performances & the gripping screenplay.

I say 3.5 on 5"
Raajneeti,Good Hindi cinema is back!,"Welcome back to the world of Hindi cinema, where movies have a huge star cast, are 3 hour longs and actually have a good story line. Raajneeti is a good mix of modern-day Mahabharata and The Godfather, which turns out to be a pretty deadly combination. Its about a political family which has just lost its leader in the midst of the upcoming election. This in turn sets his family at war as the leader chooses his brother and his son Prithviraj Pratap(Arjun Rampal) as his heirs, rather than his own son Veerendra Pratap(Manoj Bajpai). This angers Veerendra Pratap and he decides to take matter into his own hand. To help him out in this scenario is the Dalit leader form the village Sooraj Kumar(Ajay Devgn). So begins the saga of murder, vengeance and the want to gain political power by any means. In this process gets stuck Samar Pratap(Ranbir Kapoor) who had just come for a leisurely visit to India from New York to attend his uncles birthday. Turning down a teaching job in New York he instead stays back in India to help out is family. In him we see shades of Michael Corleone as a young leader who at first was hesitant to join the dirty family business but reluctantly has become a major part of it, and has started taking all the major decisions. There's also the lovely and innocent India Pratap(Katrina Kaif), his childhood friend who gradually begins to see what kind of a person Samar has become. And to help Samar there's Brij Gopal(Nana Patekar), his mother's brother. He is the all wise, all knowing Mama who can be sweet and mean all at the same time.

This film in the beginning can get a little confusing to its viewers as there are way too many characters who are introduced, and who actually play an important part throughout the film. But as the movie progress the confusion diminishes and you start seeing the clear picture and you probably start taking sides. There is no pure good or evil here, everything's in a shade of Grey, like they all believe that the means justify the end. You take Ajay Devgn who is a local village fellow, a Dalit leader, in the beginning he seems all nice and right, but politics as we know it is not a nice guys game, at least in India. Ranbir turns from the innocent American student to a smart schemer who'll do anything to protect his brother. He even fakes it with his American girlfriend Sara(Sarah Jean Collins) when she decides to give him a surprise visit to India. Be it true or not but this movie shows you a pretty interesting insight of politics in India. Its a brother kill brother world out there.

Acting wise everyone has done a good job I must say but special credit goes to Ranbir Kapoor who has shown that he can actually act in films other than romantic comedies in which he plays a chocolate boy lover trying to woo a girl standing in the balcony. Nana Patekar is not his usual self hurling abuses and shouting dialogues at the top of his voice, he is a smiling, silent planner who is very subtle throughout the film and acts only when necessary. Ajay Devgn is also in the background throughout the film, which is very unlike Prakash Jha as we have seen in his previous films like Apharan and Gangajal. But it is nicely done on his part. Katrina Kaif has probably taken acting lessons and is very sober in this film, and looks amazing as always. Arjun Rampal in my opinion has 'acted' for the very first time and by the end of the movie you feel satisfied that he didn't ruin it by his dead, expressionless face. Manoj Bajpai has a typical role, so no surprises there.

Go watch this movie if you want to see a wholesome Hindi film with substance. Its got your abuses, gruesome action scenes, a couple of lovemaking scenes put in here and there, a few songs in the background, nasty cops, hot Indian summer, everything that you need to enjoy your 3 hours in an air conditioned theatre! 7/10"
Raajneeti,"The indian way of representing ""The Godfather""",Comentario no disponible
Raajneeti,Prakash Jha's attempt at Polymorphism!,"First of all let me clear it out, I personally hate politics and am a novice in it but after watching this movie I concluded few things:

1) All politicians are murderers.

2) People switch their present or future life partners with others in order to gain votes or money to gain votes.

3) Police is just like dice for politicians. They throw and spin them against each other for their own benefits.

4) There is no term like family or sibling in politics. Anyone can turn against anyone or may be kill each other just for greed of votes.

5) Public is a complete moron; people vote for that person who gives them a cunning speech and not to that person who genuinely wants good for them.

6) There are no human beings in politics, just a bunch of 'escaped-from-hell' devils fighting against each other to attain powers not for using for benefit of public but for personal greediness.

I am not sure whether the things I concluded are correct but you will sense trueness in them once you watch this movie. Prakash Jha( Mrityudand, GangaJal and Apaharan), famous for making movies on serious topics and getting success for every film, fails this time. All his previous movies worked because he stuck to the main story till the end and the lead actor did justice with his role. But, in Raajneeti he did a different thing, he assembled a huge star cast with every actor having a potential of pulling of any movie well and a strong topic: politics, which was great but he didn't give preference to MAIN story this time which went wrong.

Raajneeti is supposedly based on the epic Mahabharata in which brothers went for a long brutal war against each other because of their personal differences. Thus, with so many characters in the movie it was impossible for any director to present two stories simultaneously: Politics and a family war. Prakash Jha had so much scope of showing the inside story of the dirty politics going on in the country, people would have been satisfied with that but we all know there very few politicians who come from the same family or may be there is no one. So, instead of showing the movie on politics Prakash Jha ended up making a movie in which a group of brothers play conspiracies against each other to become the group leader.

I am not indicating that Raajneeti was a complete failure. It made huge impacts many times. The positives were fine performances by the actors. Ranbir Kapoor, Manoj Bajpai, Katrina Kaif and Arjun Rampal deserve special accolades for their performances. Naseeruddin Shah had nothing to do in the movie. Ajay Devgn too had little scope in comparison to others but he did his job well. Nana Patekar was OK. Sarah Thomson was good.

As I told storyline would have been much better if Prakash Jha and Anjum Rajabali stuck only to the politics. Music by Wayne Sharpe went unnoticed except for the song Mora Piya which was played a few times in the background. Editing was poor, the movie could easily have been cut short by thirty minutes which didn't happen the movie so gave the audiences many chances of yawning and checking their watches.

To conclude I would say the difference lies in Prakash Jha's earlier successful movies and Raajneeti is that the previous movies were made with an intention of presenting the audiences with reality and Raajneeti was only made with intention of scoring big at the box office. The film had so many brilliant actors that Prakash Jha didn't do full justice with everyone, he wanted to include everything in his movie: romance, suspense, and some scenes which were completely unexpected and unwanted.

I know you will watch this film, so there is no point of saying anything on this but yeah this film has its moments which will remind you of old Prakash Jha. That's why I say he didn't go for politics, he went for polymorphism!

My Rating: 6/10

Thanks & Regards"
Raajneeti,Outstanding movie,Best movie about politics Loved #Ranbir performance ❤
Raajneeti,"Better than average, but no cigar","Wife recommended this film, so I watched. Overall, a better than average flick, but no cigar. The first part of the film is definitely the meatiest part of this film, where it starts as a modern day allegory of the Mahabharata embroiled in Indian politics--very fascinating. However, where it descends to trash is the second part, when scenes are ripped off scenes from ""Godfather"" and ""Hard Boiled"", and the story climaxes into an abysmal heap of dung. Worse yet, there is some pretty nice acting from all the actors involved, including non-actress Katrina Kaif. To aspiring Indian film makers, the first half of this film is how to improve Bollywood."
Raajneeti,Surely underrated,"This movie was long pending in my watch list, could only watch it this weekend. I was not having any expectation and I was pretty impressed. People blame that the movie is long, but no scene extends for more than couple of minutes. Acting is top notch, care is taken even with a small character. Katrina might be weak link, but it is intentional to consider her for the role as the director wants to establish a link with task world politician. No non sense comedy or romance. I liked songs right from the beginning, even I hadn't watched the movie. It had its loopholes, because it is not clear why Bhanu Pratap appoints his brother and brother's son as party leads, ignoring his own son. It might not be a 10 * movie, but people are giving it 4 or 5 stars, comparing it with housefull! It's definitely a top effort in its own genre."
Raajneeti,Modern Mahabharata and political godfather,"Characters: Ajay devgn- Karna Nana patekar- Krishna Ranbir kapoor- Arjun+Michael Corleone Arjun rampal- Sonny Corleone Manoj bajpayee- duryodhan

Among all these talented actors, its Katrina who is the rotten apple in the basket. Film starts like ajay film but he gets lost in the proceedings. Ranbir is the main hero who is calm outside but deadly inside. Nana gives a subtle performance as the cunning and shrewd advisor. Arjun is okay and Manoj bajpayee was standard. All the female characters have nothing to do other than becoming pregnant."
Raajneeti,Mahabharatha meets Godfather !!!,"Came after watching Prakash Jha's latest offering ""Raajneeti"" starring Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Arjun Rampal and Ajay Devgan in the lead... While watching this movie you will get a feeling that the whole plot and characters are heavily inspired from the epic story Mahabharatham and the classic ""The Godfather""...

""Raajneeti"" is basically a complex game of politics where human relationships are challenged to achieve the ultimate power...

Story rolls on with a flashback where, Bhaskar played by Naseruddin Shah, an old leftist, challenging the most powerful leaders together with the support of a young lady who considers him as God.. But destiny changes their fortunes when she gets impregnated due to Bhaskar and gives birth to the child, but even before see her child's face, Brij Gopal played by Nana Patekar abandons the child...

Rolling to present era. Sooraj Kumar (played by Ajay Devgan) is the guy whom the people of Azad Nagar considers as the leader of Dalits... In parallel, story of a family with huge political background develops with the clashes between Prithviraj (played by Arjun Rampal) and Veerendra (played by Manoj Bajpayee) for the political throne, after Prithviraj's father is shot dead... Samar (played by Ranbir Kapoor) comes in as a help for his brother and Sooraj joins with Veerendra... Rest of the story deals with who gets to the throne finally, where Indu (played by Katrina Kaif) also gets trapped in this war...

One can clearly say that, the characterization of Sooraj was definitely etched out from one of the greatest epic character ""Karna"" from Mahabharatha and that of Katrina Kaif was from the life of Sonia Gandhi.. The makers have deliberately tried to create a replica of personality of Sonia Gandhi in Katrina Kaif !! Manoj Bajpayee can be seen as Duryaodhana... And many incident/situations resembles both Mahabharatha and Godfather....

Even though the whole proceedings were looking predictable, Prakash Jha has done a commendable job in keeping us engaged most of the time... And hats off to him for the effort he has put in to make this film... Coming to performances, everybody justice to their parts...

Ranbir Kapoor is maturing with each film.. He was utmost convincing as Samar... No incertitudes on him becoming the next superstar of Bollywood !! Arjun Rampal pitches in yet another power-packed performance... Ajay Devgan was good... Katrina Kaif takes a break from her glam-doll image here and it pays off.. Her transformations were very well enacted.... Another actor who steals the show is Nana Patekar with his impeccable timing and dialogue delivery... Manoj Bajpayee as the antagonist was superb.... And the support cast also does a fine job...

Cinematography was pretty good... BG score was just OK...

On the downside, the pacing of the second half gets slowed down, at times.... BG score could have been better... Duration of the film should have been taken care of by some trimming...

On the whole, watch Raajneeti for the sincerity with which Prakash Jha has made this film and also for the excellent performances put up from Ranbir, Arjun, Ajay, Katrina and Nana Patekar...

Verdict : Contemporary Mahabharatha.. Good..

Rating : 7.5/10"
Raajneeti,It could have been better,"Prakash Jha, who gave us gems like 'Gangaajal' and 'Apaharan', comes out with a mammoth size, star studded, Political drama entitled 'RAJNEETHI'. Now as soon as the titles roll in, the drama builds up like ocean waves on a sea shore and keeps you thrilled and awe stricken with its sheer energy!

Supported by great performances, the movie is delicious in parts. It had great potential to become one of those memorial Political dramas in the history of Indian cinema; but sadly, the screenplay goes on like a free bird, post intermission!

Ajay Devgan was back in great form in the first half, but was completely wasted in the second half. I found it ridiculous that an actor like Naseerudhin Shah was given such an awfully written character. The merciless editing, which concentrates more on the Ranbir - Katreena plot, adds to the trauma. Its a pity, for if the makers had worked more on the screenplay, which seems to be still on the first draft, the film would have been much more! This is not the Prakash Jha we had seen before. Please go back to your old self.

Though I felt a lump on my throat witnessing the makers wasting a brilliant opportunity, Rajneethi is still worth a watch for the rich, yet inconsistent drama it showcases.

Rating: Nearly 'Good'"
Raajneeti,It never ends. I prayed for death. Not worth anyones time.,Comentario no disponible
Raajneeti,An Epic unfolds,"Power. The quest for its supremacy has seen many a battle through centuries bringing chaos, destruction, bloodshed, grief and loss. India's greatest epic, The Mahabharat witnessed cruel forces stand for what they seemed as right, against their brothers who, aided by a master Strategist, outsmarted the great warriors. In the end, it never was about good or evil. It was about achieving victory at any cost. Prakash Jha's audacious venture of Raajneeti treads this very path to re-incarnate the intricate battle for supremacy. An ensemble cast comprising of Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgan, Manoj Bajpai, Arjun Rampal, Ranbir Kapoor, Katrina Kaif, Naseeruddin Shah and an impressive lot of others play today's warriors in the great battlefield of Indian politics.

The back story of Kunti's 'first born', Karna leads us to the high stakes political game in the Pratap family after their supremo is hospitalized. The state is witnessing a transition in government and there is more than one challenger within the family itself. The battle lines have been drawn and clearly, the thirst for power has corrupted everyone involved. There is no good in this quest for victory. Aided by Karna, Duryodhan leads his charge against the Paandavs who are aided by the experienced strategist, Krishna. After the fall of Paandu, the united brothers of Yudhishtir and Arjun salvage their position with every move, lie and trick outside the book as Krishna guides them through the battlefield. This essence of The Mahabharat has been adroitly adapted to Raajneeti's political backdrop and all credit for its intricate development goes to writers Anjum Rajabali and Mr. Jha himself. The scale is elaborate, the cast ensemble and the plot engaging but the execution of it all with the thorough script, well paced screenplay, masterful direction and flawless performances make this a remarkable film.

Raajneeti is not for the faint hearted who solely indulge in slap-stick comedies, heart warming tragedies, mushy love stories or any vampire chronicles. This is real, wicked, unforgiving and ruthless politics. But Jha doesn't make a documentary with this cast. There is a bit of filmy drama with women being impregnated after just one encounter, love being compromised for the ultimate goal in battle and people being used as pawns on a big chess board. At the same time, Jha is unforgiving while he portrays the brutally of battle. There are car bombs, assassins, gruesome beatings, bloodshed and profanity suited to the film's environment. It rarely fails to surprise you with every new conniving plot and strategy and the convincing performances by the actors who certainly are portraying dual characters. One being those of the film Raajneeti and the other being the celluloid reincarnations of characters from The Mahabharat.

This is also a performance powerhouse. Naseeruddin Shah of course, excellent in his brief role, deserved more screen presence. Nana Patekar's simplicity in portraying the most important of characters is awe inspiring. He is indeed a mentor for the rest of them. It's been a long time since we watched Manoj Bajpai in a worthy role and what a laudable performance it was! His defining moment was his speech after Shakuni Mama's incident. Ajay Devgan being Jha's favorite man maintains his typical intensity in a solid act while Arjun Rampal delivers the most shocking performance which is also his finest yet. Watch him as he speaks to his brother on his cell phone with bloody hands and you will witness the intense actor in him. Sarah Kane in a brief role seemed quite seasoned already along with Nikhila Trikha (Kunti). Katrina Kaif has proved her worth with Raajneeti. Jha instilled confidence in Katrina's mediocre dialog delivery and nurtured her to reach her epitome in the public speech she makes in front of thousands. She now sheds the tag of the cute, beautiful new comer and surpasses many of her peers showing her versatility in just the past year. Speaking of which, the new force to be reckoned with is certainly Ranbir Kapoor. From being the lover boy, funny man, awakened man and salesman, he proves his mettle as the underdog who earns respect through actions. Whether he is playing chess on his BB or watching his game plan unfold on the screen or calming an infuriated, impulsive brother, Ranbir shows his composure and caliber while making his presence felt in the midst of accomplished senior artists.

The musical score also has an ensemble cast here. With Pritam, Aadesh Shrivastava, Shantanu Moitra and Wayne Sharpe, the music is brilliant. The pop-classical Ishq Barse, the melodious Bheegi Si Bhaagi Si, the uplifting theme song - Dhan dhan Dharti by Shankar and Wayne Sharpe and Aadesh Shrivastava & Shashi's outstanding Mora Piya are all excellent, even with their well remixed versions (Mora Piya 'trance' mix!). But Jha mercilessly edits the songs from the movie, only to keep a bare minimum when the screenplay could exhale.

Prakash Jha seemed to draw inspirations from The Mahabharat, 'The Godfather', 'Kalyug' as well as the 'Sarkars' and in his distinctive way, gave us an engaging, witty, hard hitting, intense drama that is a depiction of a democracy that works, but at a price. With real people, about 10,000 of them, Jha shot in locales that serve as the battlefield with superb cinematography by Sachin Krishn. His well researched and gripping script is the soul of this multi-starrer and his vision to bring the greatest epic to life just adds to the viewer's intrigue and awe element. One might even need repeated viewings in order to grasp some deeper dialogs. Minor dramatizations apart, Jha's work is commendable simply because very few have succeeded with the scale and grandeur of Raajneeti and while critics can dissect all they want, this IS the most definitive and convincing version of The Mahabharat and the ugly face of democracy."
Raajneeti,"Ambitious, engaging, pertinent, and well made, though clichéd and theatrical","Rajneeti is an ambitious, engaging, entertaining, pertinent, and well made film, though at times clichéd and theatrical.

The ensemble cast delivers above expectation, especially the consummate performance by Ranbir Kapoor and aided by the adept ones by Manoj Bajpai, Ajay Devgan, and Nana Patekar ; Arjun Rampal is also surprisingly convincing, with the performances by the female cast ranging from the adequate to the weak.

Further, while the director and screenwriters do a skillful job of weaving the political commentary (mostly accurate albeit broadly generalizing), the moralizing (unwelcome and hackneyed), the scheming and vendettas, and the classical mythos (its main inspiration is the epic Mahabharata), into an entertaining and finely paced film; however, it's somewhat protracted and overly theatrical second half, lowers the intensity, with the generalizations and pauses detracting from its focus and the theatrical violence lowering its credibility, which coupled with an ending that's rather tame and platitudinous, the film falls short of the masterpiece category.

Nonetheless, in an industry where condescending, vapid and ""timepass"" movies are the rule, and political correctness construed as deference and social aloofness, Rajneeti is a relatively bold, refreshingly frank, and an entertaining exception.

Kudos to Prakash Jha and the production team for their ambitious, riveting, and fine piece of work."
Raajneeti,Gripping storyline while being an analogy to Mahabharata,"Great music, Awesome star cast, and equally Good performances. Might have been stretched a bit by the end, but overall a great movie. Must Watch!"
Raajneeti,Something's missing!,"I understand that I am probably one of the last few people to review Raajneeti. Too bad I took a lot of time to decide whether I wanna watch it or not.

Forty long minutes after I started watching it, I had started planning dinner and to-do list of work the next day. And then came the scene which made me sit straight and pay more attention. Followed by another one and another one Yes, Raajneeti took forty minutes to become interesting and for the next fifty minutes or so, continued to be so.

Let me put something straight first. Even the first forty minutes were not bad. It wasn't like I was watching Tushaar Kapoor playing Terminator or something as horrendous. There was nothing wrong with what was going on but still something was missing. The individual performances were quite decent but the narration and screenplay were not tight enough to keep me engrossed. The first scene that hit me was the party meeting invasion by Ajay Devgan, followed by Nana Patekar's visit to Ajay's area and so on.

The other snag in the story was the little stint of Naseeruddin Shah that started the whole affair. shoddily and implausibly written, although well executed. Of course, parallels to Godfather started becoming more and more obvious. Where middle of the story was gripping, fast paced and cleverly written and executed, it's the climax that left a bad taste in mouth. You are showing politicians who are aiming to become 'Mukhya Mantri' of the country and they are killing people with their own hands and running on the streets with guns in their hands? Sounds believable, doesn't it. I don't deny the existence of bloodshed in politics, but the likes of president-elects do not act like contract killers, do they? Nor do we see three generations of one political family being killed during one election campaign.

My favorite adaptation of Godfather still remains Virasat. If there could be a second, it would be Sarkar. Raajneeti is not a bad movie, but it's not a great movie. With a better screenplay of first half an hour and a more realistic climax, it could have been a great one because the individual performances were quite brilliant.

Talking about performances, to me, Nana Patekar was the show stealer. He had a beautiful character to portray and how well he portrays it, is anybody's guess. He used his body language and smile to perfection. Thoroughly enjoyable performance from the veteran. Raajneeti's very own Luca Brasi with a local touch the gentle respectable mentor.

Then there was Arjun Rampal. I was one of those who thought that this guy would never be able to act. I liked him in Rock On, he was one of the good things in it, but in Raajneeti, he was excellent. He does remind you of Sonny from the Godfather with his demeanor and aggression. I think Prakash must have told him to read the book before offering him the role. To me, he was more Sonny than Kay Kay Menon of Sarkar because Sonny was not suppressible or manipulated. Here is an actor who took his work seriously and was there to prove a point.

This is the first performance of Ranbir Kapoor that I have seen. Yes. First. It was a complex character and not as positive as the real Michael of Godfather, or Abhishek of Sarkar or Anil Kapoor of Virasat. This one had negative shades in it. He was not a loyal lover like both of them. He was selfish and manipulative. He did not mind killing to get his way even though he appeared very soft and sweet natured. A character with so many shades needs a good actor to deliver and Ranbir does. A fine performance overall. He is definitely a better actor than Imran Khan. Solo hit material.

Manoj Bajpai gets a meaty role after a long time and it was good to see him. Ajay Devgan was typecast. The actor badly needs variety of roles and that does not mean foolish 'Golmaal' and 'All the Best' comedies. Try something like 'Pushpak' may be? Nikhila Trikhas as Ajay's mother was a bad choice for the role. Her confrontation scene with Ajay toward the end was probably the worst of the entire movie and added to the climax woes. Limited description of Naseer's role was also a downside of the movie considering that it was a high-flying political family we were talking about.

Katrina Kaif was also a bad choice for that role. As usual, she fulfilled the glamour quotient alright but failed to deliver on performance promise. Her expressions in the confrontation scenes with Ranbir and then Arjun could put plastic dolls to shame. Sarah Thompson, who played Sarah, was much more natural than Kat. Shruti Seth is a pleasant surprise.

Prakash Jha needs improvement. That's the only thing I can say about him. Director's role starts where the writer's finishes. Yes, the revenue of the film will contradict what I am saying but my opinion holds. My biggest criticism would be his effort to create sympathy for people who are blood thirsty and enjoy killing, not regret it. Anil Kapoor of Virasat and even Abhishek of Sarkar had different motives for killing than Ranbir of Raajneeti; hence, the sympathy was justified. In Ranbir's case, deliberately or not, it was not justified.

Raajneeti, irrespective of its commercial success, has some serious flaws. Had it been for below par acting, it could have been a big disaster. However, the credit goes to Jha for casting Nana, Ranbir, Arjun and Manoj Bajpai who saved the ship which would have otherwise badly sunk."
Raajneeti,Amazin,Best p.jha's movie .. outstanding . Real image of politics in India.
Raajneeti,Raaj at the BO!,Comentario no disponible
Raajneeti,The Quest for Power....,"We all knew what Prakash Jha is capable of, and by all i mean those who have seen Gangaajal,Apaharan,Dil dosti etc and Damul.

But in Rajneeti he perhaps for the first time assembles such a glittering cast and crew and each one gets a meaty role and does justification to their acts.

After a long time we get to see a movie which really is what a movie should be Great story,excellent narration,plots that fix like a jigsaw puzzle,n superb acting. So what if the movie can easily be related to THE MAHABHARATA with pandavas,krishna,duryodhan ,karna n kunti and to the book GODFATHER where its finally the youngest son(Michael Corleone) whom everyone thinks to be an outsider and is underestimated changes the game in the interpretation of modern day Arjun with Nana Patekar as Krishna to guide him. But everything is not so smooth as the games of dirty politics in a democracy is played just like the game on a chessboard where no second thoughts are given to remove a pawn or even if it might be the king himself.

Performance wise...everyone lives upto and even goes beyond expectations. Naseer is just superb in his role as a revolutionary even if it was small,Nana Patekar shows us why he's still regarded as one of the finest actors even when he doesn't has to speak much,Arjun Rampal ,Ajay Devgan and Manoj Vajpayee too hold their acts together.Katrina's lovely to watch sans much glamour and Ranbir Kapoor too portrays his journey from a rank outsider to a shrewd calculator of the game of politics brilliantly...

The music of the movie esp the background scores are at par the other aspects and having 4 composers for 4 diff songs in a single movie also works well

In all if you love good cinema and not those mindless ones, u r in for a really good treat my ratings 4.2/5 . . . NJOY!!"
Raajneeti,could have been a really good 2 hrs movie,"It is a real good movie a must watch for people who like movies with some reality. The direction is real good. Mostly everybody did justice with their roles(some exceptions). Manoj, Nana and Ajay stole the show. Mr Shah as usual is real good in the short role( he tends to get monotonous after a while). Mr Rampal good acting but he is too much model looking for this role. Ms Kaif as well she is hot but i think that she should limit herself to the romantic comedies because she really cant act(hate me for it but thats my opinion). Ranvir did a excellent job, its was of course his movie, in first half a the movie. I guess they wanted the movie to be a Indian style full length feature, which without the songs is a tuff task, but the story lost the track towards the climax. You can make a real average film eg Mist, but a solid ending can make up for the rating. Or you can make a real good movie and mess it up with a below average ending.

Still a good entertainment and nice work by MR Prakash Jha."

Raajneeti,A Film that could have been so much Better had the Director noticed the Flaws !,"Well, here are a few questions that I wanted to ask the Makers of this Film after having seen the film : 1. Is Mr. Prakash Jha planning to write a Book on ""How to become pregnant by having Sex just Once!"", I'm sure the people that have seen the film would know what I'm talking about! And yes, It happens with three different Couples in this film! And it's really weird! 2. What was Mr. Prakash Jha thinking while casting the Actress, pardon me, the Woman, as the Mother in this film? The woman just doesn't know how to act! Couldn't he see that! She completely ruined that Mother-Son Confrontation Scene with Ajay Devgan that could have been so emotionally moving had the Acting been good! But, throughout that scene all I was doing was scratching my head with disgust and asking myself - What the hell is this woman doing and how could the Director finalize a woman like this for such an important role! I'm sorry but in a film filled with mostly National Award Winning Actors, a Stupid and Irritating Addition like this makes you want to puke, quite literally ! 3. How could he cast Katrina Kaif in that role? She was extremely Unnatural in Most Scenes and I had expected her to deliver a much finer performance, but she was a total let down. And, How Ironical, the Scene where her performance had to be the Best and Strongest, turned out to be her weakest Scene in the Film! I'm talking about the scene where she gives the Speech, It seemed to me like the woman standing in front of the Mike was neither a Politician nor a Widower, but some really Nervous Newcomer in Bollywood who is ""auditioning"" for a role in a film and has to give a speech in front of thousands of people, in order to get that role in the film. Yes, that's what I felt like while watching that scene, I didn't feel it was a real scene, I felt it was some Nervous Newcomer's Audition Clip! Her gestures, her Voice, her pitch, in that scene conveyed just no real feelings! Her performance was devoid of Naturalness. To sum it up, Katrina Kaif COULD NOT breathe life into the Character she played in Raajneeti. I'm hundred percent sure that any other, yes, ""any"" other Bollywood Actress could have performed this role thousand times better! But yes, there have been Flawless, Outstanding Performances by Arjun Rampal, Nana Patekar, Manoj Bajpai but above all, Ranbir Kapoor surprises and impresses you by delivering the Best Performance in the Film. He's Intense, He's One Hundred Percent Natural and he totally immerses himself into his Character. He's clearly worked really hard at looking and being the Character. He's undoubtedly, the true Kapoor Scion ! And he does remind you of Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) from the Godfather but I'd have to say, out of the two, Ranbir's Performance is Better! In the end, Raajneeti is a well-made Film but the thing that ruins the film in parts are the two main Ladies- The woman who played the role of the Mother and Katrina Kaif. To be honest, I liked the Supporting Actresses a lot more, including Shruti Seth, the Seductive Bitch who's eager to get a Ticket and run for Elections, who was Mind Blowing even in her 5 minute Appearance on Screen and Sarah Thompson, Ranbir Kapoor's Sweetheart from America. The Film had a couple of other Drawbacks as well, specially in writing, and if they would have been corrected, this Film could have been so much better.... It's one of those rare films that makes you think that with just a few modifications, this film could have been Outstanding which it sadly and definitely, is not......."
Raajneeti,I might be the odd one ... but i didn't like this flick,"When someone buys a ticket to watch a movie starring Nana Patekar, Ajay Devgan and Naseruddin Shah, they expect a high voltage movie. This stars have the charisma to spread fire on the screen. But what a wastage ??? Naser was just in the movie to give a speech and birth to a un-wanted child ( what this character eats ... though he is old, he succeeded in just one time).

What they did with Nana Patekar? He just sit around, doing nothing. Sometimes he give advice to Ranbir. And yes, once he inspires Ranbir to shoot Ajay in a Krishna fashion. Ranbir can kill a unarmed man driving car using mobile-bomb(don't know what actually it called), but not Ajay. why? Truly need a explanation? Ajay Devgan ... though in first half he has something to do and say, in second half he just wonder around, like a PA of Manoj Bajpai. Ajay can easily kill Ranbir's father and refuse any relationship with Ranbir's Mother, then what happened to him? Why he didn't take the clear shot at Ranbir? And, When he knows that Manoj is in danger, then why does not he call others for help? As the movie showed, Ranbir's father accidentally went to airport with Ranbir and he is there just for some minutes. Lets assume it takes him two hours. In just two hours how Ajay and Manoj plan such a good trap and kill him? Why Ajay and Manoj always try to kill people going to the airport? It feels like a typical Hindi movie with no character development, no good story, there was neither any twist nor any surprises to audience. It has a love triangle and an unwanted child who fight against his mother(by-birth).

What new to this movie? It shows fight between political leaders. But I wish they come up with a griping and interesting story."

Documentary Now!,Good stuff,I never saw any of the documentaries that they spoof but every episode was still funny to me.
Documentary Now!,Unusual sense of humour,"I love this sense of humour based on characters having a great consideration for themselves, looking ridiculous from the viewer's perspective, with a pinch of cruelty and tons of nonsense. In short: the character doesn't know he's in a comedy. It isn't common in US comedy, more frequent in GB. This sense of humour requires a perfect execution in the filming and acting and I think that this series has brilliantly achieved it. I'm not an easy laugher and I'm usually the guy with the poker face in the cinema when everyone is exulting. But watching this show, I think I've disturbed my neighbours with my unpracticed heavy laugh. I particularly appreciate the introductions."
Documentary Now!,Big Vivvy and Little Vivvy,Still one of my favorite parodies of all time! They nailed it. I laughed a lot! Mother doesn't like it at all.
Documentary Now!,"Beautiful, funny and educational. Highly recommended.","As a film student, I had to go through all the important documentaries, starting from the 1920s with Nanook of the North till nowadays docs.

Studied them, analyzed them, watched them over and over again. Great pieces of documentary filmmaking to say the least. NOW, what these guys have achieved here with these light-hearted and hilarious mockumentaries, which reflect the original ones, is just extraordinary! They actually revamped them by adding a comical element to many (with their special SNL humor touch) and certain story alterations but kept the original style of filmmaking accurate and similar to the originals. They made a different documentary; i think that if you didn't know any of their actors or their intentions and happened to come across one of these randomly, then you d think its the real thing! The result is just magnificent.

These mini docs are full of heart, talent, comedy and most of all they give a wink to the viewer to visit the original documentary.

Maybe it will be good to search for a guide on what documentaries they are basing their mockumentaries on so you get more into the humor but its definitely not necessary.

My personal favorites are the Sandy Passage, the Eye don't lie, the Blue Jean Committee and Juan likes rice and Chicken. Excellent series. 10/10."
Documentary Now!,Brilliant! Haven't laughed that hard in a long time,"Aktham Tashtoush who left a bad review below must not have read up on what this is about. To fully appreciate the brilliant comedy in Documentary Now, you need to watch at least part of (or read about) Grey Gardens for the 1st episode, and then watch an episode of VICE on Youtube to fully appreciate the 2nd episode. Bill & Fred have obviously watched and researched the original characters and have portrayed and mocked what is so funny about original shows. If you like morbid comedy, then this delivers.

Bill & Fred are hilarious together, and my only complaint is that there is only going to be 6 episodes it appears."
Documentary Now!,"Some episodes better than others, but overall fun","My family and I really enjoyed this series. It's hard at times to remember these are Mockumentaries, because the acting, writing and stylized editing make it seem like you are watching an actual documentary."
Documentary Now!,"Some of the Smartest, Funniest Writing in Years","It baffles me that a show this funny can remain so underground, with less than a ""cult classic"" following. However I understand why many have looked over this show. The concept is not only very ""out there"" but the writing is very smart. In a similar way that the UK version of ""The Office"" is often overlooked by US fans for being ""too smart"", this show is closer to dry, British humor than classic American humor. But, through and through, this show is brilliant. The attention to detail is astounding to the point where the original documentaries look worse than their versions. Mulany, Meyers, Hader and Armisen pour so much passion into this show. This is not a cash grab, it's not a money maker, it's a passion project shared by 4 brilliant comedians and that can be seen in every episode. Please support this show, brilliant direction, writing and acting such as this should be rewarded and unfortunately this show is being overlooked."
Documentary Now!,Great work,"I just watched the new mockumentary show with my favorite comedians and I satisfied with what I saw there.

First episode that parodies Grey Gardens makes me laugh really hard and the biggest plus of the show is that it's seems very attractive and naturally. I mean, if you stop thinking that it's a parody on few minutes then you can truly believe that it's a real film.

Work of writers, acting of actors and design of clothes that they were wearing, everything is awesome. I want to mention Bill Hader because, how I think, he's made an excellent work on his role. Lil' Vevie is something I really scared of. And this can mean that parody became to something more.

Second episode was little strained but still have a lot of funny moments.

I can call myself a big fan of these guys but objectively Documentary Now! is one of the best show in last 5 years."
Documentary Now!,Brilliant and Hilarious,Brilliant and hilarious show that takes just the right amount of details from real docs. Wish we had more Bill Hader in later episodes!
Documentary Now!,All over the place,"Some episodes were very good. ""Batsh*t Valley"", ""Searching for Mr. Larson"", ""Gentle and Soft"" are some of the good ones. ""Original Cast album"" and ""Waiting for the Artist"" are painfully unwatchable. I'm sure there are some who like that kind of thing, but it was a major chore to get through those episodes. ""Final Transition"" and ""Any given Saturday Afternoon"" were reasonably OK. Armison is great, and some of the guest stars make it interesting. Overall, it balances out to about a 6."
Documentary Now!,"deeply niche, exceedingly masterful; a wet dream for cinephiles and comedy writer nerds alike","I will admit to not understanding this show for years. i, as i'm sure is also the case with many others, just found myself confused while watching season one as it premiered. i found myself waiting for some overt goof or joke, when i finally realized this material is far more akin to the work of Andy Kaufman as opposed to the more straightforward vibe of SNL. its less about building to a punchline and moreso about absolutely commiting to the bit.

watching any interview or conversation that includes either Seth Meyers, Fred Armisen, or Bill Hader, it becomes clear that they are simply comedy nerds of the highest order. Armisen has the deadpan commitment needed to sell these jokes, no matter how subdued. Hader has the imagination to turn a simple gag into a realized world. and Meyers has the deep appreciation of the blood, sweat, and tears that go into comedy writing that makes him see the deep brilliance of a joke that would go over the heads of the general public. give these three the keys to a show and you get a truly unique experience, unlike anything else on television.

besides the sheer commitment to a joke, the other standout of this show is the production's borderline obsessive attention to detail when it comes to recreating the documentaries being spoofed. one of the biggest joys of this show is seeing how effortlessly their crew recreates the style and era of each film being parodied or satirized. Armisen and Hader's long-practiced talent of impersonating is also used to great effect for this same purpose. i struggle to name any other actors who can make at least two seasons worth of material where they both embody entirely different characters that works just as well.

given the hyper-focused lens of both comedy and film being put on display here, its definitely not a show for everyone. but if you can open your mind to something completely different, i think you'll find it hard not to enjoy. with the right mindset, its like a warm cup of tea. cozy, comforting, and tranquil to just sit back and take in."
Documentary Now!,Good but uneven.,"Weirdly enough, you'll probably like episodes based on how much you like the documentary they are spoofing in it. If you don't care about the original doc, you just won't be invested in the jokes. But the War Room episode is absolute genius, Hader has never been better. Armisen is a talented, genius creep. Still a creep tho!"
Documentary Now!,5 minutes of watching was too much.,"Absolute torture, a past review summed it up perfectly.

Had high hopes for this series, but only 5-10 minutes in it was unbearable. Not funny in the slightest."
Documentary Now!,I LOVE THIS PREMISE!,This show is comprised of hilarious mockumentaries based off of existing documentaries and I find it so entertaining.
Documentary Now!,Welcome to Documentary Now,"Pros: Fav episodes are ""The Eye Don't Lie"" (a rare spoof of Errol Morris) and the two-parter ""Mr. Runner Up"" where Bill does his great take on Bill Evans; you can tell that they love their docs and so do I. Cons: :/"
Documentary Now!,Nanook Revisited and Gray Garderns,"Being a fan of documentaries- these 2 are such wonderful parodies. I saw this last year, so I can't remember them all in detail. I would watch again. Satire has to be true to the thing yet take it one step further. Hard to do- many parodies fail bec they can't while keeping the integrity- these are 2 important classics- Funny! and true to the original Doc. If you haven't seen them. Did they also do Salesman, if not they should, and I would suggest, Daily Nation, Gladiator Days, the one about Ali in Zaire. it would take geniuses who really understand Docs, and Human natural. It says 3 seasons, will have to find to watch. This measure up with the best of all time- Spinal Tap- and I think also the other Chris Guest, Best of show and Mighty Winds."
Documentary Now!,"Great concept, intelligently made, though not without flaws","A faux documentary series, parodying documentaries in general. Each episode has is a different ""documentary"", often parodying, or at least mimicking but in a humorous way, actual documentaries. Created and written by Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Seth Meyers and presented by Helen Mirren.

A series that is hilariously funny at times but also missed the mark at times. The concept of a documentary-parody series is great and the humour, written by SNL luminaries Fred Armisen, Bill Hader and Seth Meyers, is very clever and often understated. Therein already lies the first problem in that sometimes it is too clever for its own good, resulting in the joke going over the audience's heads.

I also think how much you get out of an episode is reliant on how familiar you are with what they're parodying. The best episodes for me were ones where I recognised the source documentaries. I could then see exactly what of the original they were parodying or adjusting.

The episodes that fell flat for me often seemed to arty or dry though if I knew the source material I probably would have appreciated them more.

Overall, when it's good it's brilliant but it can be quite hit and miss."

Documentary Now!,Very clichéd writing,"Lorne Michaels WAS very talented - over 40 YEARS ago, when he started Saturday Night Live.

Back then, with the original (and still, THE best) Not Ready For Prime-Time Payers (Gilda, Dan, John, Garret, Jane, Lorraine, and - Chevy. By the way; Bill Murray joined AFTER Chevy left), it was biting the hands (the network, et al.) and they DID take chances.

But, since they left Mr. .Michaels has done the same old, same old for so long, it's as if he's a 'puppet,' and everything is 'pre-made.'

There's no more daring humour, no jokes that dare cross the line. It's all safe pablum.

So, seeing his name as Exec. Producer is no surprise - to me. It's like that Simon 'LeGree' Cowell, and all his 'Star Search' rip off series, where the winner DOES get a contract, but, it's more like indentured servitude; they (the winner) is forced to crank garbage out for (in this case, Lorne Michaels) for eternity. They're forced to do his pre-made yuk-fest' whether-or-not they want to.

Analogy; just like a kid who likes Chef Boyardee ravioli might grow up and still find - as they've grown to adulthood, this canned thing to be their 'favourite,' in all its sugar-drenched, chemically- tasting awfulness, it also goes with humour. As there are people who laughed at 'chicken crossing the road' -type humour when they were little, and STILL do years - perhaps decades later.

There are a lot of people who have moved past this.

For the people who still think SNL humour that they remember from their young adult-hood/college years as 'funny,' they will love this.

For what these are - little 'take-offs' of well-known/familiar films, told in a style that almost has a built in 'pause' for the audiences guffaws, it's fine.

But, if you're sense of humour is beyond this stage, these (so far only) 6(I hope that's all) episodes encompass 'ha-ha' versions of Grey Gardens, The Thin Blue Line, and several other well-known documentaries.

The thing is, the original stories these 'parodies' are meant to 'gently nudge' (yawn), are so well- known, and has already had parodies, jokes, and what-not made, that it's pointless.

The humour is plain obvious, i.e., in 'Sandy Passage' (Grey Gardens), we start with the old 'Uncle Mitly' vaudeville gag; men in drag. Yes, it can be funny, but, just drag, JUST for the FACT of having someone in drag ISN'T funny.

The characters in Sandy Passage - 'big' and 'little Viv' are, again - very obvious caricatures, with absolutely nothing new.

The real people, 'big' and 'little Edie' were so much larger-than-life to begin with, they've had performers of every calibre - from small clubs, and gay bars, to big venue shows - do send-ups of them.

The take on Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line, one knows going in that they're going to make the southern  everyone - incredibly dumb (which is OK by me), so dumb, that even with the 'innocent' (but really guilty) party doing/saying everything BUT 'I'm guilty,' they STILL try to brush it off as him being a 'cut-up,' and the (truly) innocent schlub is 'of course' (according to them) guilty (primarily because he ISN'T a southerner).

This is sophomoric humour at best, and if that makes you laugh, then perfect for you.

Otherwise, skip it."
Documentary Now!,Genial!,"I love documentaries in general...so to watch this ""mockumentary"" is just a delight! So well written, produced, directed...loved every single episode. But this season 3 brought true jewels, starting with Owen Wilson as a guru from the '80, Cate Blanchett as a ""tortured"" artist, the Co-Op episode with Richard Kind and those absurds lyrics typical of Broadway sometimes...genial!"
Documentary Now!,Cleverly conceived idea but it can be hit or miss,"Documentaries are generally a pretty esoteric cinematic experience and co-creator Fred Armisen's comedy is also pretty esoteric. As a result putting those together is going to lead to something that's not easy to appreciate or particularly funny every time out of the gate.

While the premise's novelty-- re-imagining popular documentaries with a comic bent -- was enough to get it through the first season, the show usually sinks or swims based on how funny the episode is.

With the exception of Michael Moore, Spike Lee, Morgan Spurlock, or Werner Herzog, very few documentaries have ever surfaced to the national consciousness. As a result, many viewers (including myself) are not going to go to know of the original source either, so the comedy often has to stand on its own in a way that most direct parodies don't. I'm not sure if this airs on the IFC TV channel, but the website has a featurette airing the two versions side-by-side which is certainly helpful.

""The Town, A Gangster, a Festival"" approaches the brilliance of Christopher Guest's films (what I'm sure is an influence on these guys) in terms of attention to detail. A whole world is colored in by oodles and oodles of funny characters. This should cater to the wheelhouse of a writing staff-- all SNL alumni (if I'm not mistaken) where creating characters who can display a memorable quirk within a minute or two of screen time is a prerequisite.

Without the advantage of the large ensemble format, the show faces a harder challenge with generally only two people front and center. The show can sometimes work brilliance here but some episodes have also fallen flat. Among the most brilliant entries are ""Kunuk Now"" and ""Globesman"" as both are hilarious based on stand-alone comic characters and broad reference(the primitive Eskimo in the former, the 1950s image of masculinity and the corporate salesman in the latter) rather than a specific cinematic style. ""Kunuk Now"" tells the story of a kooky producer who jumps production in Alaska and an intellectually-challenged Eskimo who single-handedly creates all our modern ideas of cinematography. ""Globesman"" takes the squeaky clean image of the 1950's and turns it into a portrait of sheer obnoxiousness.

Among the other episodes that work somewhat well, ""The Blue Jean Committee"" is an exaggerated character portrait of two men whose lives have gone in opposite directions since fame. It distinguishes itself by being perhaps the only episode in the series with sentimental value (the final hug between the two tugged at my heart strings at least). Armisen is a music obsessive and his effort falls flat in the similarly themed second season episode ""Test Pattern"" which feels derivative: It mines similar nuances of ""Blue Jean Committee"" in mining similar nuances of concert culture without giving us a reason to care.

""Dronez"" also roughly works without any source material as it provides a never-ending supply of dumb people and juxtaposes them with an incredibly dangerous situation.

Others like ""Juan Likes Rice and Beans"" and ""The War Room"" are middling: They work based on the hyper-specific which will vary. In the case of the former, I saw ""Jiro Likes Sushi"" which helped me enjoy it at a fuller level.

The rest of the episodes, including the series premiere, fall painfully flat based on hyper-specificity.

Documentary Now!,It's the most creative comedy show,"Documentary Now is one of the most ambitious and creative comedy shows I have ever seen. It's exciting for a me, a big film fan. It's also very funny."
Documentary Now!,A TV show where you have to do homework to enjoy it,"I thought this was going to spoof documentaries in general, but it just spoofs specific documentaries. In order to find this show funny, you have to watch dozens of documentaries. Maybe it would be funny if you've seen all of the documentaries the writers have; but I haven't. And I don't want to do a bunch of 'homework' just to be able to watch a TV show."
Documentary Now!,My stomach hurts from laughing,"I decided to check it out on a whim...I watched 3 random episodes...all hysterical! Wow! Smart, well written, great acting of course...Sandy Passage ep had me crying!"
Documentary Now!,Comedy Gold,"Documentary Now! (2015 - ) - [9/10]

I love this show. There are hundreds of reasons behind why I love Documentary Now! (2015 - ). Maybe I love it because of how it mocks legendary documentaries. Maybe I love it because I want to be a filmmaker - and they make fun of a lot of filmmaking tropes. Maybe I love it because it is exceptionally written. Maybe I love it simply because it is hilarious. Critics love it and audiences have never seen it. It is ridiculously smart, absolutely entertaining, and masterfully made. Anyone that has seen a documentary will find this show funny. Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Rhys Thomas, Alexander Buono, John Mulaney, Lorne Michaels, and so many more are attached to this show - each contributing to the hilarity. It is crazy how detailed this show is. It dances across a thin line; it is so close to offending the original documentary, but it honors the original documentary (or documentary company) with each episode parodied. Many shots mimic the original documentaries' shots. In fact, they were able to get some of the equipment that the actual documentaries' used (lenses, sketch artists, etc.). After each episode, you want to see the original documentary, because they make jokes that will go over your head. I love it. The writing is exceptional. It is hilarious, crude, genius, and masterful. The creators are all veteran comedians, with backgrounds in SNL (1975 - ) and it works so well. Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is like a cinematic, thought out, and sincere SNL (1975 - ) sketch. Each episode is a hit, because of the writing. Whether from the source material, spoofing, or mockumentary style. They try not to mock legendary documentaries, but pay ""homage"" to them. There are Emmy nominated performances from each season. Fred Armisen and Bill Hader are masterful comedians. They fully become their characters, with different voices, looks, and quirks. Both of them have very dry, stark, humor and encapsulate what Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is. The guest stars are also hilarious. Owen Wilson is in a couple episodes, alongside Michael Keaton. Peter Fonda, Mia Farrow, John Mulaney, and so many more. Each episode requires a different role (or the same episode has multiple roles), and that just shows how great Armisen and Hader are. Everybody that has worked with this show are comedic geniuses. This show is a lot of fun. Some episodes aren't as strong as the others, but they're funny nonetheless. I've loved this show for awhile, and I can't wait for more seasons and episodes. Each episode has its own unique style (big props to Alexander Buono and Rhys Thomas' direction). Each episode is comedy gold. Each episode encapsulates what documentary filmmaking is. Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is uniquely original, perfectly spoofs classic documentaries, is sincerely made, and a show that every comedy fan must watch."
A Touch of Green,Great Movie,"This historic drama was for the most part excellent. Majority of actors were very good except for Cyndie Yu (Zhu Qing) felt could have been better acting on her part or better choice of actress for the role. Sad story, not that romantic except Guo Zen part with Zhu Qing. All and all definitely worth watching."
A Touch of Green,Wow. History story untold.,1. Great drama 2. Great acting 3. Heartfelt 4. Human frailty 5. Female point of view as well as male. 6. Untold story of history. 7. Evil side of Communism 8. Didn't mind subtitles with the drama that pulls you in. 9. If this does not get awards it should.

Dead to Me,Dark comedy and mystery? Fun!,"Dead To Me follows two women who tragically lose someone in their lives. This Netflix Original Series is very mysterious and the comedy is dark as the night. The first episode sets up the vibe for the rest of the show and it only pulls you in more and more, up to the point of no return.

The two leads - Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini - have wonderful chemistry. Their interactions and the moments of sorrow feel like as if they are best friends in real life and just connect in the most sincere and natural way. The acting is also just sublime and shows once again that these ladies don't get enough high profile acting jobs in Hollywood, which is a shame. The subject of the series is not an easy one to handle and to combine it with comedy is very risky, but it really works here.

The episodes are easily bingeable with a runtime around 30 minutes and every episode has several situations our characters get in, that'll keep you interested while you watch it all unfold. Every episode also ends on a cliffhanger that made my jaw drop, over and over again - which I'm a sucker for.

The show starts with Jen (Applegate) losing her husband in a hit-and-run accident. She's obviously having many problems and trying to deal with the fact she's a widow and single mother now, trying to raise her two teenage sons. She decides to join a meeting for those who lost loved ones and it's here we get to meet Judy (Cardellini). Both totally opposite personalities, but still connecting in a way they didn't think was possible. The pacing of every scene and episode is enjoyable and kept me engaged throughout. It's fun to see things progressing not knowing what will happen next.

The events slowly come together as a cohesive whole and we meet several key witnesses and side characters that help our leads develop into different personalities, without losing the characteristics we love them for. This build up could escalate in unseen proportions and who knows what might happen to the people closest to them.

The ending gets wrapped up really well and it does set up a potential follow up, but it could work as a standalone season. Dead To Me Season 1 is a tale of sorrow and mystery, the latter intriguing its interested audience the most. Don't think you've seen it all after the big twist gets revealed at the end of the first episode. More secrets arise, which cause lots of banter and drama. In my opinion the writers could've made it all even darker with the comedy-aspect and certain intense situations. Who knows what a second season might bring.. Although I think it would be a waste to see these characters disappear, since they are so much fun to spend time with on an evening after work, with a glass of wine in your hand. Cheers!"
Dead to Me,Applegate & Cardellini Knock It Out Of The Park,"The new show starring Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini just had its full first season drop on Netflix and both leads totally knock it out of the park.

It's premise (Two widows meet at a support group meeting, and become close friends) is not something that sounded interesting to me, but I love Christina Applegate, always have since I had a crush on her in Married With Children, and since then, I have always enjoyed her work in movies and TV. So I gave it a chance. Well, I binge watched the entire season in one go.

Linda Cardellini is an actress I only know from the Scooby Doo movies and other supporting roles in comedies (Daddy's Home) and the MCU, I didn't really have an opinion of her, I didn't like or dislike her, but she is amazing here

Darkly comic at times and heartbreaking at others, it is utterly compelling and each episode just makes you want to watch the next. I highly recommend it, one of the best TV shows I have seen in a long time."
Dead to Me,Binged it in one go,"This new show popped up on Netflix so we decided to watch an episode, 5 hours later the whole season came to an end. Really enjoyable dark comedy, drama, crime all wrapped up in to one. Great performances from both the ladies. If you are looking for the ""who done it?"" type of show you found it, however there is a slight twist. How does one reveal what they know. Enjoy it, looking forward to season 2."
Dead to Me,NOT like grace and frankie,"So...loved the show. But I have seen reviews of people who dislike it because it's too much ""like grace and frankie"" and other reviews of people who LOVE it because it is ""like grace and frankie ""...all of these people are wrong and it makes me think they didn't watch the whole series. Do not go into this expecting grace and frankie for the gen x generation...this show is much darker,the sense of humour is much more dry, and the subject matter is way heavier....I love both shows...but other than the fact that they both involve 2 women who live together after circumstances brought them into each other's lives, they have nothing in common. Go into it knowing it isn't a GandF knock off, and you will enjoy it much more.



Edit: season 2 is even crazier and funnier! Some of the plot is a bit far fetched but it's easily overlooked and even accepted because The two leads are AMAZING. The chemistry they have together is a huge part of why this show seems to work so well no matter what is going on."
Dead to Me,SURPRISING BRILLIANT DARK COMEDY,"I was sucked in within ten minutes. Brilliant acting and plot twists. I am always a fan of Christina Applegate, but Linda Cardellini SHINES! THOUGHTFUL, KIND AND HONEST. Enjoy the binge! Thanks NETFLIX!"
Dead to Me,I'll never see a paper crane and not get emotional.,"Just finished season 3. First time in a very long time that the seasons got progressively better. I did not want it to end. I was unbelievably touched. I needed this show right now. I'm not posting spoilers but it turned in a direction in season 3 that got me in the feels as I laughed. Hard to create a show that does both. This one masterfully does. The writing is perfect, directing outstanding, lighting so good! Setting (nice artwork) and site location outstanding. Casting in this show was perfect. I can't imagine any other cast. I gave this a 10 because of the difficulty in illiciting all the emotions that this does, the writing directing and acting was as good as it gets. If this show doesn't deserve a 10 Which show would? (Other than Queens Gambit of course). This show was as good as it gets in every way. I don't think I'll ever be able to see a paper crane without getting emotional."
Dead to Me,Incredible!,"Started with the Netflix teaser as I was aimlessly scrolling and 5 hours later I've watched every episode! And when I say 'watched' I honestly mean it. Not 'watched' whilst also playing games on my phone or 'watched' it in the background of doing other tasks. Watched! Eyes firmly fixed to the screen. It's a great balance of comedy and true tragedy. The acting is incredible, the main characters are fully formed and dynamic women that really show there is always a person behind the monster."
Dead to Me,"Good season 1, season 2 wasn't as good","Season one was gripping, you couldn't stop watching. Season 2: the comedy seems slightly more forced and the situations (let's say without spoilers) seem a bit more unrealistic, just to suit the narrative. Overall still enjoyed it, but found myself a bit bored at time's during season 2."
Dead to Me,PHENOMENAL!!!!!,This show is simply phenomenal! The acting is superb! You really feel the nerves of everything espacially Judy (Linda Cardellini)! The characters and plot keep you hooked and it's hard to stop binge watching! Christina Applegate's performance is astounding! But Linda!!! Hand her that Emmy now!! You empathize and fall in love with Judy! Such a well rounded character and pure. You want nothing but the best for her! I suggest you watch! IT'S AMAZING AND ONE OF NETFLIX'S BEST ORIGINAL SERIES!!
Dead to Me,"Loved 1st season, hate the 2nd","I don't understand why so many commenters say how second season is even better?! Everything that made this show interesting and exciting, setting us up for traps of what to expect and delivering the opposite, being witty, making fun of melodramatic stereotypes, while still feeling like a serious depiction of grief, are gone through the window in the second season, delivering exactly what first season made fun of. Like the witty humor of the bird showing up as the dad in the first season, is now being dragged out into a whole story to beat us on the head with what the main characters go through. It's just not the same show anymore, which is a shame as I was super excited for the second season."
Dead to Me,Gem,"Usually if I see Christina Applegate I'm already on board (have a soft spot for her since the ""Married With Children"" times) but damn she nailed this character, she shines in this role brilliantly! She absolutely owns every scene, floored me in the extra emotional scenes, such an underrated actress! She's so strong as a lead that for me the only properly competative actor on her level seemed to be (to my surprise) James Marsden and Brandon Scott. Great pacing, great story, great directing and acting and overall really great show! Highly recommend!"
Dead to Me,"A stellar season 1, decent season 2, but abysmal season 3","Christina Applegate is one of the funniest actresses out there with superb comic timing. You can tell that early on from her ""Married with Children"" days. Attaching her to this project is a smart move to lure audiences to season 1, and oh season 1 delivers. It offers a unique, captivating plot in the backdrop of comedy with Applegate leading the way. Season 2 does not quite measure up to the quality as we see plot lines meandering a bit, but it is still watchable and decent. Season 3 does not come out until two and a half years later, plagued by COVID restrictions and Applegate's heartbreaking health issues. It is still great to see Applegate in action doing what she does best, however I find the season 3 ""sitcom conflicts"" too basic, resembling those flagship misunderstandings in ""Three's Company"" and shows like that. Needless to say I am disappointed by the abrupt ending and the lost opportunity to redeem things in a season 4."
Dead to Me,Am I the only one who thought this show completely contrived and unbelievable? Apparently...,Comentario no disponible
Dead to Me,"Two great actresses, ten easy stars","I'll tell you what. If I was rating this show on the basis of the story alone, I might give it a seven and credit it with being a solid thriller. If I was rating it for its comedic elements, maybe I'd bump that up to an eight. The story is sound, after all, and the comedy is intelligent and used in just the right amounts.

The way these story tellers blend comedy with darker elements is masterful. It's a show that can literally be a laugh-out-loud riot one scene and jerking tears the next. With that in mind, why not give 'er an eight or nine and call it good?

I'll tell you why. Because outshining all of that are the performances of the show's two main stars; performances as impressive as any I've ever seen. I mean it, too. Until I took a look at this show, half-hearted to begin with, I had no idea what a powerful actress Christina Applegate turned out to be. I was not much familiar at all with Linda Cardellini but now I'll count myself as among her biggest fans. Both of these women knocked their every scene out of the park, whether it was Applegate being hilariously bitchy, Cardellini being a cute misfit or the two of them weeping sloppily over the endurance of their friendship under extremely difficult circumstances.

I don't know if the two women are friends off screen, but in the context of the show, they have chemistry. Tremendous chemistry. Some of the most realistic and intense chemistry I've ever seen on a screen, small or big. Ultimately, the story is about that friendship and these actresses make that story irresistible. All the other plot lines, some of them downright goofy, are just bones on which to hang the flesh of this magnificent story of unconditional love, loyalty and maybe a smattering of co-dependence.

And with these complex mathematical formulas in mind, I have no trouble at all lighting up ten stars for this one.

I love this show, and many of the characters that populate it. Ben, the big dork, is a favorite, although I wasn't so fond of his twin. Those WERE two different actors, right?

The neighbors, friends, coworkers and support group members were all richly played by talented actors, but I tell you. None of those characters, no matter how colorful, could hold a candle to Applegate and Cardellini who just raised the bar on buddy movies forever."
Dead to Me,I accidentally the season,"It was already late when I started with the pilot. I needed to sleep as I had an early morning. I watched the whole thing.

Every episode was so enthralling. The writing, acting, and directing are just a treat! Such believable characters. Even though you think some of the situations they get themselves in seem a bit much, it's presented in such a way that you can understand what the characters are going through; what motivates them, and what they're feeling.

Maybe I relate to the portrayal of grief, and trying to keep it together. The acting was on point. I love layered characters. Nothing is black, and white.

Don't start watching this at 1am."
Dead to Me,Just binge-watched the whole 10 episodes,"I was having a crappy day, so grabbed a coke and some chips and hit the couch, looking for a little distraction. I forgot about the clothes in the dryer and at 9pm I took a break to throw a sandwich together because I realized I had missed dinner. Kept me riveted right to the end, which made me laugh out loud. Great characters, human and beautifully flawed. The actors were perfectly cast. I don't think any follow-up season is needed, the ending is perfect just the way it is. I'm stingy about giving 9's and 10's, so an 8 is great in my book."
Dead to Me,A refreshing take on grief,I know too much about grief and this story explains so many different stages of grief that are not talked about. The story has so many twist and turns and it's well worth the watch
Dead to Me,Sometimes less is better,"This series is well written and Christina Applegate has an amazing performance. The premise is a very interesting mystery and this series goes from good to excellent throughout and thus can't quite get a higher rating. I have to think that with more editing of some unnecessary lulls and picking up the pace this could have been great. I almost didn't make it to EP3. Glad I did, still worth watching."
Dead to Me,Enthralling much better than I expected,"Such a great dark comedy/drama! Christina Applegate, Lina Cardellini, and Sam McCarthy are my favorites in it. I love how effed up it is in some ways, I see why some would binge all the way through it's like a great craving of food Dead to Me is phenomenal! Great too that Adam McKay and Will Ferrell are producers they're awesome beings."
Dead to Me,"First two seasons great, final season a tragedy",Comentario no disponible
Dead to Me,Amazing,"Probably one of the most solid dark comedies I've watched in ages. Both Applegate and Cardellini deliver a very believable and surreal ""Odd Couple"" relationship that simultaneously makes you feel the sorrow and joy of the tragedy that brings them together. Here's why I gave this ten. I started watching it, ended up watching it until 4AM. Finished it in the morning and, STARTED WATCHING IT AGAIN. It begs to be watched again because of how the story unfolds. Outstanding series and I hope that Netflix renews it."
Dead to Me,"First season: great, Second season: I hope there is no 3rd season in the pipeline","I found the first season great, a unique story with great acting. Then came the 2nd season. It started slow, not exciting and certainly not unique. Then a number of new story lines appeared and a bit cheesy and very soapy. The first season I rated an 8, the second a 6."
Dead to Me,Season 1 was good season 2 sucksss,If you watched netflix original season 1 Dead to me Dont bother with season 2 it's a train wreck of 7 straight sappy episodes of someone crying and gets worse every episode
Dead to Me,Absolutely Brilliant,"I never thought that the pilot episode would make me laugh and kind of sad and encourage me to share grief... It's weird in a way, ridiculous but in the best way... Lovely performances, precise dark comedy, absolute fun ride."
Dead to Me,A brilliant duet in a compelling story,"Totally binge worthy, this series captured me from episode one till the end. It's all about the black humor and the amazing cast, who gave this intelligent story life and credibility, driving the spectator skillfully from laughter to tears. I just read about Christina Applegate's health issue and I think it's so empowering and admirable how she managed to complete her work and give an absolutely thrilling performance. And so does Linda Cardellini, James Marsden and everybody else, offering truly great acting in an original script that goes further from being fun and takes a chance to explore grief, friendship, motherhood. I will definitely revisit this one!"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Heart touching Movie,"Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu(Translation : The Jasmine vine in Seethamma's Courtyard)- One of the best Telegu movie i have ever seen..(I have watched only few Telegu movies. so please don't mind). ""Simple but beautiful"". All the characters have done their job almost perfect. Thanks to the whole crew for such a heart touching film. The movie revolves around 2 brothers and their love to each other and to humanity.Family relationships and values are the main focus in Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu. PrakashRaj as usual performed exceptionally well. Anjali as a Goddess taking care of the family with innocence. Samantha as a cute Angel.

Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Seetamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu - A clean Family film,"SVSC is undoubtedly the most awaited movie of the season if not this year. This is the first true multi-starrer movie in Telugu cinema in last three decades. Mahesh Babu who is in sparkling form teamed up with ace performer Venkatesh in this film about Sibling bonding.

What is it about?

Peddodu (Venkatesh) and Chinnodu (Mahesh) are brothers who have diverse personalities. Peddodu doesn't settle down in life by doing some job and Chinnodu will be in job search. Peddodu not settling in any job is the biggest pressure on their family. Chinnodu tries to guide him but in vain. At a stage the relation between the brothers gets strained and how everything gets cleared is the final scene.

Performances:

Mahesh Babu is currently in a wonderful form especially with his comedy timing. His one liners in East Godavari accent are a treat. He has delivered yet another wonderful performance as chinnodu. He simply carries off the film on his shoulders and provides good entertainment in parts. If not for Mahesh this film would have been a letdown. Such is the impact of Mahesh on this movie.

Venkatesh has been dominated by Mahesh in most of the scenes as Venkatesh played a serious role which is completely in contrast to that of Mahesh's. However Venky had his moments here and there where he comes up with trademark sentimental performance. Being a multistarrer one would expect Venkatesh to have a better role.

Prakash Raj is very good in his role. He is very natural and so is Jayasudha. Anjali's character is over the top at times but she is good and lovely in the role. Samantha is alright. Rao Ramesh and Tanikella Bharani are fine.

On the Technical Front:

Songs are soothing and melodious. Background score is pleasant. Cinematography is cool. Editing could have been better. So many characters have been chopped off (RaviBabu, Raja Raveendra) without proper justification. Dialogues are good. Production values are commendable.

Srinkanth Addala is a good director who has great script sense. His first film Kotha Bangaru Lokam has few very good scenes that prove this point. SVSC is not an exception. Srikanth has once again done a fabulous job in conceiving scenes. The best scene is on Prakash Raj in Badrachalam. However, the director ignored many essential elements to highlight the sibling bonding. His prime focus is only on the brotherhood and he didn't bother about other things which is not an intelligent move on the commercial front.

Analysis:

This movie starts off at its own pace and things start to move briskly once Mahesh and Venkatesh comes together on screen. There is no separate comedy in this film and that has been handled by Mahesh. First half is completely dedicated to create feel good factor and the director succeeds in doing so.

Second half is where the real story has to start. But director only focused on brothers and their emotions. They go apart on few occasions and patches up later. This process repeats for two or three times and the movie ends. You will never realize that the film has gone into the climax part until the movie concludes.

Narration is too flat and that is the biggest drawback. Mahesh and Venkatesh bonding scenes have come out well. Mahesh Babu's phone chat with Samantha is entertaining. Anjali character and Prakash Raj character could have been dealt better for more emotional impact. Mahesh Babu solely shouldered the movie from sinking with his excellent dialogues and performance.

This film has few emotions that will appeal to family audience and females. People who have great bonding with their brothers too might get connected. We have to wait and see how masses embrace this movie.

Verdict: Seetamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu - A clean Family film"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,View from a teenager,"~SVSC~ You expect so much and enter the cinema hall, after watching this is what i felt about the characters:

Mahesh: you are always awesome, but the movie didn't have the thing to make you special

Venky: dull acting, but suited the village style

Anjali: i guess u lost weight running too much in the movie, good debut into large films(expected to be!)

Samatha: as usual, good performance, voice sucks, but better than before.

Prakash raj: brilliant job, but i guess your jaws are paining after a lot of smiling ! no one could replace your role.

Samatha's father: you were so good that i hated u in real, i felt like slapping u!

Overall a pinch of sentiment(so-called sentiment, not really), humor, relationship and whole table spoon of NOTHINGNESS. yes there is NO story in the film, except the message that you can win over the world with a smile on your face. And was there a problem with the projector guy, so MANY repeated scenes.

Not a great movie, that's why people don't make multi-starter movies. Srikanth Adaala, you failed to do what other directors succeed doing a century ago.But again this a breakthrough from those action filled loud movies.

Rating: 6/10, at least for the characters!"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,A beautiful tale of two brothers,"Not often you come across such masterpieces from the Telugu film industry. SVSC is a wonderful emotional tale of two brothers with contrasting personalities and conflicts arising from them. To make such a movie, which throws light on the character's negative shades, and that too with two stars with larger than life images is a truly courageous effort by the director. Though it lacks the entertainment quotient, it more than makes it up with the emotional bonding and the chemistry between the lead actors. Terrific acting, fresh treatment and an underlying message that appeals to every human being, make this movie an absolute classic. If you love Telugu movies, you do not want to miss this."

Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,"The world isn't divided into good and bad people, however the good guys always win!","Okay, so here's the catch: what you usually expect from a Telugu film is your average dose of masala, glamorous actors, a story that shall keep you gripped at the edge of your seats and you can a few more flashy stuff to this list( all it'd do is populate it with sheer uselessness).

This one's different though, its bold. How you might ask? It's got a flat story some might say but ladies and gentlemen this is reality and it this is as flat and straight honesty will ever get for you.

Acting: pure class in the form of Mahesh and Venkatesh who carry themselves not just with looks but with a form of decency which can be achieved by men who are well decent to say the least. The acting ensemble consists of the classic players in the Telugu film industry and each reciprocate their usual roles to perfection

The story is honest, the screenplay is ecstatic, the dialogues make you want to cry and this time I'm not talking crocodile tears. The background score gives you goosebumps.

Finally spare a thought for the director, this man has taken an ordinary story some would go on to compare it to the old classic ""Gundamma Katha"" and well designed it taking into account the ideals of modernization to such brilliance that shall not be achievable in the near future.

Men will be men....but well gentlemen are a class apart. Go watch this movie with any sort of company and you shall exit the theater with a smile on your face. The team of SVSC take a bow!"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,"I wish it was less commercialized, it would have made a great film from a good film.","I wish it was less commercialized, it would have made a great film from a good film.

It's a good film to begin with, it kept me interested and despite the misgivings in terms of bad song placements, I liked it. I is not a a story that has a point, a proper destiny, a simple man becoming hero being someone who does something for himself and even others, it's no one man army, it's a life of a family. Father is the teacher of values, mother is the giver of food and love, sons or daughters are the heirs of values and good tastes, and that grandma is a good entertainment channel herself. Of all these, there is a girl who lives in the same house, and is extrovert and yet nice and she is none other than Sita (Anjali).

Of all the performances I like the performance of Anjali. That one scene near the end where she says ""Nannu Okka Cinemaki Teesukellakapoyinaa parledu"" is just a glimpse of the variation this actress is capable of. I wish, we see more of her, she has potential to become a good actress. The next best was Mahesh Babu, he has given his routine looks, similar diction of dialogues, the one liners are now known. Yet, Mahesh's expression and the enunciation, his voice modulation, make him a good actor, he is growing with each film and it's appreciated. In this film itself, Mahesh delivered comic dialogues with such an ease that there is no need for a comedian. Also, a mention of Rao Ramesh who has emulated the diction of the yesteryear's actor ""Rao Gopal Rao"" and has done a good job. For Venkatesh, most of the scenes are like Bread and Butter for him and has done it aptly, except that he touches his collar too many times. All others have done well too.

Now, music was a big let down, the placement of songs hampered the flow of the film itself. Cinematography was good, sound design was not so good as dubbing is low at few places. Editing should have been better, just cut out the songs and in that inconsequential chase of 'Goodu Raja', and few more scenes, and that will make this film more interesting.

I accepted the film as it is and on a whole, it's a good film nevertheless, also happy that two big actors have agreed to come together for such a script. But what I am unhappy with is the producer, who wanted to make business and that too big business in a script that can be more beautifully taken. Director has done a great job in fleshing out the script and convincing the cast for the film. But coming to his direction, he must now learn a lot and take this success forward.

A 3/5 for a good family entertainer. Watch it out for Mahesh and Anjali's performances and for the emotions that we like to follow, but indeed are not following so much. It's a bit preachy in climax, but it's OK."
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,A brilliant attempt to depict a good traditional Indian family genuinely.,"Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu !!! The movie totally deserves such a decent title.. :) I hate to call it a super hit or average or anything, its a whole new wonderful experience.. Don't expect heroism,action scenes, hilarious comedy, romance or any routine stuff of telugu cinema. It just depicts one good traditional Indian family and their emotions beautifully. Srikanth Addala, Dil Raju take a bow for doing this. Totally a decent n good film with amazing cast, simple music, beautiful taking. Mahesh and Venkatesh have done a fabulous job. Anjali did a promising job. Samantha, a fresh go with loads of cute things. Mahesh proves again he's adaptable, looking so natural with Godavari slang. Bottom line : Best one in recent times to watch with family. PS: You'll be touched if u have a sibling. Watch it soon, before some people spoil it for you saying words like boring, dull etc."
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,A Wonderfull feel good family entertainer!!,"Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu: A wonderful feel good family entertainer movie.... After a very very very long time, a full fledged family movie....The movie is all abt the 2 brothers Venkateshmahesh babu (a) Pedhodu Chinnodu with happy situations around the family and both were rocking in all scenes..

Venkatesh: the character he played in this film is a different one. He is neither sweet husband nor a sacrificing family member. His character has an attitude problem. He likes to live life in his way, he don't knows to act for others. A guy who loves his brother much..

Mahesh babu: he did a outstanding performance as younger brother, his character was nicely portrayed, who is playful most of the times...

Other characters: Anjali dominates as the movie title is her name, and she has great respect in the family n she did brilliantly quite well. Samantha, an Angel always... she acted as lover girl who performed perfectly her part.. Prakash raj, always whatever role came his way, the one person can do that is him... outstanding performance..

Technically: Songs scored by Micky J Meyer are good. The title song is excellently picturized. Background music by Mani Sharma is very good. The dialogues penned by Ganesh Patro and Sreekanth Addala are natural and meaningful. Cinematography by Guhan is a feast to eyes..

I felt like ""The audiences who watch the film Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu would immerse themselves in the film. Chances are that they would feel like they are watching some real life sequences from in and around their house"". As i felt the same...

Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Worst movie,Movie is poorly executed. No storyline. Movie tries to depict that money does not matter but poorly fails in this endeavour. Whole 2 hours no twist no story and ends abruptly.
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Refreshingly Sweet!,"For the start.. Ignore all the negative reviews.

Well it's very unusual to see a telugu movie without comedy, this has really least comedy scenes.. can almost say no comedy at all. But still the movie was really good, all the sweetness bound in it.. esp after watching soo many useless movies like Rachcha, Rebel, Naayak etc

Too bad i missed watching it in the theater. It was full of life thou..you can't always expect to be a total entertainer with comedy, action, and everything combined. This dint even have extreme emotional scenes as well. But the movie is definitely very satisfying.

Anyways.. Enjoy the movie.. It's worth you time!"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Simply Beautiful,"Some Say Tollywood has gone into monotonous flow of Mass Masala Flicks but here is the latest offering from Srikanth Addala in Dil Raju Franchise which has broke all such factors with flat story line and excellent screenplay and rich display of Andhra culture.

even though there were certain amount of multi-starers in the past few years but this one is way a part from all those with Mahesh Babu and Venkatesh coming together leaving their cinematic characters and entering into real life characters is some thing to be applauded.

It has no commercial elements, no separate track of comedy away from story line but it still impresses the audience with a smile on their face.

a must watch and expecting more of these kind of movies in years to come from tollywood."
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Relatable family movie.,"Sweet simple family movie.

Many relatable elements.

Mahesh Babu's smile is so infectious, you can't help but smile too. 😘

And for the first time I saw Prakash Raj play a positive character, in fact an angel. 😄"
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,"Clean,good and message oriented Family Entertainer.......","after a long time,a movie with complete Telugu nativity.more over two actors were placed in perfect rolls,and all this credit goes to Srikanth addala.movie carries human emotions and relations in a soft way.Venkatesh and Mahesh babu justified the story with their performance.on-screen chemistry was so good between this both heroes.Music is also a plus for the movie.Mickey j.mayor scored good tracks without missing trend and BG-M is provided by Mani sharma.Anjali and Samantha had good and lengthy rolls in movie and also shared their part.Director never missed telugu nativity throughout movie and did a great screenplay.Prakash Raj and Jayasudha were fantastic and suited a lot for this heroes.Guhan as D.O.P and art director did worthy job by making the movie so colorful with their work.More over everyone should appreciate Dil Raju for making such a beautiful movie. Completely movie is full length family entertainer with good message."

Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,"i was really skeptical, but i was wrong","This movie is too good.i don't really feel compelled to write reviews. but, i made it a point too write a review. Towards the end of the movie, i started thinking, why don't we have more movies like this. Perfect Family entertainer. too good.

There's something about this movie that pulls you in and don't let you get away. to be honest, i'm not a big fan of family movies, even i loved this movie. This movie is released in 2013 in Telugu, i'm surprised that no one made a remake of this movie in Tamil. You cannot find movies like this in Hindi.

The complex love that exists between the brothers is adorable, which is rare these days. People chose money over family, which i never understood. this movie is an eye opener."
Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu,Bad and boring,"Tollywood is criticized for illogical and over the top masala films, but now also they are making bad family dramas like svsc. This movie is a about a father played by prakash raj and his sons played by venkatesh and mahesh babu. There is no idea about prakash raj's occupation so you can assume him as a retired man. Whereas both venky and mahesh are jobless. So the whole family is surviving with prakash raj's pension money. In the beginning venky is having a decent job given by his relative but he leaves because he is advised to smile and behave properly with the staff. Usually in movies unemployed guys are shown in a massy way. But mahesh's character is shown in a classy way. Director is not bothered to show what mahesh and venkatesh wants to do in their life. What is their goal and ambition? Also there is no reason why venkatesh is behaving like a jerk despite having a good family. And in the end, venkatesh gets married without getting any job. Nobody gives us a girl to marry if we don't have any job then howcome he? Director wants to give us a message that family values are important than family wealth but does that mean its okay for the sons in the family being unemployed? The biggest drawback of the film is it has no story at all. Film goes on without any purpose. Only good thing about the film is that its a clean family film without any crass jokes, skin show, item songs, violent or over the top action scenes and hero buildup which you see in regular Telugu films. Otherwise svsc is a bad and boring film."

How to Get Away with Murder,,
Genius,How to Get Away with Legal Inaccuracy,"I saw at least 3 other reviews of this TV show that put it at a 6/10 for the sole reason that it is an inaccurate portrayal of lawyers. Yes, and...? Does that take away from the brilliant plot and acting? I don't think anything in film or television is an accurate portrayal of anything. If someone were to rewrite this exciting show into an ""accurate portrayal"" of law, then it would just be a show about Viola Davis filling out paper work and occasionally showing up in court. And some of these reviewers go on to say that it is a shame that people believe that is how the court of law is in real life. My advice to them is to go to the IMDb page of the Avengers and write a review that says, ""it's a shame that every single person who watches this movie now believes superheroes actually exist,"" because apparently no one who is a consumer of media entertainment has the common sense to know that lawyers do not, in reality, go around killing and bribing everyone.

No one watches a show like How to Get Away with Murder for a lesson in law, they watch it for the interesting characters and fascinating plot. I had to write this review to correct all of the mistaken reviews that gave this show anything less than a 7, because the overall rating of this show was dismaying to me. And to learn it is for such a irrelevant reason!"
Genius,Ridiculous and gay and pretty awesome,"If you want to watch yet another procedural about lawyers that's realistic or even researched in any way this is not the show for you. However if you want an over the top, melodramatic, sexy, unpredictable show that'll keep you guessing and laughing and freaking out with every cliffhanger, then watch this.

Viola Davis is amazing (unsurprisingly) and Analise is one of the most interesting main characters on TV right now.

This show had one of the best pilots I've seen in a while and the season 2 premiere was one of the best episodes of television I've seen all year (and I watch A LOT of TV).

In summary, How To Get Away With Murder is kinda dumb, kinda funny, really engaging and enthralling and constantly surprising."
Genius,"Loved It, Then Hated It, Now I Love To Hate It: A Lawyer's Tale","At the time of writing, I have seen all of season one and the first episode of season 2.

I've seen other reviews on here that talk about how impossible it is to watch this show if you have any legal knowledge, and I would just like to add my two cents to this topic. I sympathize. I'm a lawyer, and have worked in criminal defence (once upon a time), and I, too, generally have a really hard time watching any legal dramas whatsoever. Television takes egregious liberties with the justice system, and shows that portray the practice of law are difficult to watch when they are wildly inaccurate, and it is frustrating to witness protagonists do things that you know are illegal or unethical. As annoying as this is, the tendency is understandable—even criminal law is only so compelling in real life. The assumption is that most viewers do not have legal training, and that nobody—lawyers included—will watch a show where competent, ethical practitioners stay at the office late looking up cases on Quicklaw, fiddling with binding machines, and trying not to smudge pad thai sauce on their prelim transcripts.

This show, however, is so ridiculous that it actually rose to the level of suspension of disbelief required for me, at least, to still enjoy it. It is basically a soap opera. Trying to subject it to human logic is a pointless exercise that will inevitably leave you discombobulated, shouting at the sky about injustice or whatever people do once they've discovered their whole life is a lie.

For instance, I would be hard pressed to conceive of a more profound conflict of interest than that contained in the season 1 episode 10 court scene if someone bet me $100 and a case of beer (I won't describe it in the interests of no spoilers--the blame-shifting thing). And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Every other thing that every character does in this show would get you summarily disbarred, fired, or charged with something.

At the end of the day however, that is not the point. This show seems to know exactly how over-the-top it is. But rather than trying to scale back the insanity in the name of realism, it revels in knocking it right into twelfth gear. Left and right, people are lying to each other or the court, sleeping around and committing felonies—sometimes at the same time—because why not? The degree of accuracy is so low that the mercury drops out the bottom of the thermometer and creates a rift in the space-time continuum. It fails so hard it wins. It is the Hearts equivalent of shooting the moon.

So get some popcorn and get comfy. Try to resist the analytical voice in your head that keeps screaming ""No!"" and just let it wash over you. Everything will be fine."
Genius,FINALLY A SHOW THAT GAVE PROPER CLOSURE,A show that ended properly in a long time even though their makeup was terrible 😂.but loved it and will always leave a impact on me MUST WATCH!.
Genius,Among Network TV's best dramas,"I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review for this show since I have loved it since day 1. Meanwhile, How to Get Away With Murder has become my favorite show on television, and here's why: Even in a golden age of television, network TV has been lacking original content in the last few years. There are too many procedural dramas and too many superhero shows, so therefore I am glad to have a show like HTGAWM. Yes, it is partly a legal drama, but it is definitely so much more than than. IMO it is primarily a mystery and a thriller at the same time because every season starts with an intriguing flash-forward, showing us a very dramatic event that takes place in their mid-season finale. However, when most shows have flash-forwards they only feature one in the premiere and practically have no build-up to it, HTGAWM does the opposite, it features a flash-forward in every one of the first 8 episodes of a season and plays with our mind. By the time you have watched the mid-season finale itself, your mind will be blown. But why am I telling you this? Because I am trying to underline that this show has the most brilliant and shocking twists you could even imagine, and they have about 100 of those. They are executed with such brilliance and complexity that you will never get bored or annoyed by them. What is probably even better than the brilliant twists, however, is the masterful acting. Viola Davis nails every single scene she is, she portrays this deeply flawed character beautifully with so much depth. I cannot praise her enough, she deserves every single award that exists. That is not to say that the supporting cast is any less mesmerizing, they all bring their A-game consistently. They all deserve recognition. And one last thing: character development!!!! So so brilliant! The characters that you meet in the pilot change a lot as time passes and they all become very three-dimensional! Just go ahead and watch this show. I could say so much more, but just go enjoy the fun and crazy ride. You won't regret it, I promise!"
Genius,One of the best shows I've ever watched,I honestly can say that this is one of the absolute best TV shows I've ever watched. I feel like they are my family! I'm going to be so sad when it ends.
Genius,Freaking Amazing,"I honestly think the other review was uncalled for. This is fantastic! The beginning is a little confusing and hard to figure out whats going on but honestly, that's what makes it so suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Most crime shows are all about justice, which is great but sometimes it's nice to see the opposite side of things. There's so many dynamic characters in this show, it adds interest. Viola Davis is amazing in this. She's such a strong actress and her acting is very believable and on point. What I will say is, some of the characters seem a bit awkward. Again, I think that's what makes it interesting. The awkward characters have a place and don't seem like a random actress throw into the mix. I find this show, sexy, interesting and very dramatic. It's the perfect mix! I say give it a watch, if you don't like it no harm, no foul."
Genius,I Love This Show,"I know that some people don't like the outlandish schemes of this show and say that the legal parts and law school parts are ""unrealistic"" but that's the point of the show! Nobody wants to watch a show about the real lives of law students, they're just not that interesting. The reason that these shows are popular is because they are crazy, and lots of people like that. There's nothing wrong with that. If you don't like the drama, then don't watch this show, because yes, it is unrealistic. But that's what makes it interesting! Please just stop hating on it because realistic everyday lives aren't all that interesting to watch unless they're comedy and some people like drama because we are humans and we simply want the drama. We want those lives because they're exciting, regardless of how unrealistic they are. I LOVE THIS SHOW. It's so interesting and I love finding out what happens next. The acting is amazing and the story lines are very creative. It's really good and I highly recommend it."
Genius,twisty storytelling wears out over time,"Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) is a sought-after law professor and a famous hard-charging defense attorney willing to push the envelope. She selects her students Wes Gibbins, Connor Walsh, Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone, and Laurel Castillo as her interns to work on her cases. There is Annalise's husband Sam and her secret affair with police detective Nate Lahey. There are her associates Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom. The first season centered on the murder of student Lila Stangard and Rebecca Sutter who is the main suspect.

This is Shondaland. The flashforward structure of the first season is challenging but kept the show different and interesting. There is nothing better than Viola Davis. She shines but she also overpowers the younger cast. The biggest overshadowed problem is Alfred Enoch who is most known for a minor Harry Potter role. He's not alone in that problem. It doesn't help that the storytelling is non-stop twists and turns. The characters never get the stability needed to build chemistry. The second season centers on a different case and by the third season, I have to give up. All the effort is used to keep up with the twisty stories. Only Viola Davis is able to break through. It's just really tough to remember the situations for each character over the years."
Genius,Fun!,I just binge watched season one and I loved it. First off I want to say that there are a bunch of complaining critics on here that I think are missing the point of the show. How to get away with murder. It's not a show that's going to depict total reality. It's a fun to watch exaggerated clever show (but there's a bit of truth behind every bit of this exaggeration). Maybe the critics that rate the show so harshly should really watch it with a grain of salt. So many are saying that it's unrealistic. The law schools are not at all like this. Law isn't practiced like this. Oh grow up. The crazy twisting corrupted lying cheating goings-on are exaggerated and accelerated to make it more fun to watch. This is a fun show and I am most certainly looking forward to season two. Now I will agree that there are some gratuitous sex scenes that just really aren't necessary. The writers really don't have to spell it out for us. We get it. Maybe they will ease up on that kind of stuff in season two. Good show and I recommend it to people who are open-minded to the fact that TV doesn't always have to be based on true absolute reality. It's supposed to be entertaining. And this show is definitely entertaining.
Genius,Dissappointed,"I started watching this show as it was recommended highly and also had good online ratings. I REALLY enjoyed it at first but halfway through the season it started feeling tedious. Things got convoluted & started to get unreal. I was REALLY dissappointed at the end of season 1, so I won't be continuing to watch."
Genius,Good start,This starts out well but then all the characters just get annoying because they are all deviant in behavior. There is no balance.
Genius,"Brilliant writing, brilliant acting!",Comentario no disponible
Genius,Messy and addictive,"This is a story about a law professor and her inner circle of students, collegues, lovers and friends who each season find themselves involved in a murder and use their legal knowledge to cover up their crimes.

Sounds distasteful? It very much is. It's messy, ugly, upsetting - and totally brilliant!

The entire cast is phenomenal. Viola Davis in particular brings magic to every scene she's in, and it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Professor Annalise Keating.

While the series pushes the limits for how many murders we're supposed to accept that our little group of anti-heroes gets involved in, the story is a dramatic rollercoaster that I couldn't get enough of. I binged every season. This series feels so fresh that you can't really compare it to any other show."
Genius,Slow at the start but Awesome all- in- all,"The most interracial show ever made, seems to be the main theme of the serial. But the plot takes the cherry. The twists through out the story is simply hypnotizing. Even though it is slow at the start, the end pays it off with interest.It seems to have been made with a message of women, gay and other empowerment and is not at all subtle about it. It has Gay sex in every episode..that girls might love. But all these negative points are well outweighed by the the story-line plus acting. Majorly the actor in the lead role ""Anna Keating"". Her work is impeccable. I can't remember the last time I failed to identify the killer beforehand. The director would amaze everyone with the brilliant work. ""How to get away with murder"" there could not be a better title than this.So, watch it right now, bear first few episodes with patience, then drown in its magic. Great Show!!"
Genius,Wow this show keeps getting better season after season!,"I enjoyed this show from the start of the season and rated it 8/10.

Then as the episodes and seasons progressed, I got annoyed with the constant back and forth timelines - of which I felt were confusing and unnecessary. Thus I dropped my score down to a 7.

Well, now into season 4, these timeline flashbacks and flash forwards are making sense and getting better.

The tension of this show is intense and Viola Davis has found her role - nails it season after season. I want her character to be my friend and mentor lol.

Score is now up to a 9.5 rounded up to a 10/10."
Genius,Hooked from the beginning to the end,"I binged the entire four seasons in under a month. All of the characters are so interesting - you love and hate all of them at one point or another. It's an emotional rollercoaster - I cried A LOT! I love how each episode has its own story, but there is always a thread of flashbacks or flashforewards that keep you hooked until the end of each season. This is not a series you can just have on in the background - you really need to be giving it your full attention to appreciate its brilliance. Couldn't recommend it enough!"
Genius,The type of Mystery Show that keeps you hooked,"The show is very thrilling and written in a very smart way. What I love about this show, is that they constantly make sure your mind is blown. The show keeps alternating between present scenes and future scenes which makes you very thrilled to know how can this character become this character and do these stuff, and by the end of the season, the present scenes and future scenes merge into one another in a very professional way that does not get you confused as to what happened. Every episode they give you a clue and show you one more thing about the story, which is great for me really, because I hate waiting for seasons and seasons to know stuff, and then get shocked that they canceled the show, or no questions were answered because the directors forgot details that happened all together. They let you know a lot each episode, but still not enough, only to get you hooked. The actors are absolutely great, each character displays a completely different personality than the other, but somehow they complete each other.

Excellent Series. Excellent Script. Excellent Director and absolutely excellent actors."
Genius,I don't usually use the term guilty pleasure...,"This is definitely a time to use it. Unlike other ABC shows I used to watch like Desperate Housewives, I never heard a good word about HTGAWM. When Desperate Housewives first appeared there were plaudits and comparisons with Six Feet Under and Sex & The City. Much like DH, this show centres on a mystery (who killed Lila Stangart and how are the main characters going to get away with murder?). Add to that some of the horniest students and professionals I've seen on television since Queer as Folk, you've got a great mix of intrigue, hysteria and mystery. It doesn't pretend to be a good show. It's overblown, it's riddled with over-acting, the plot is paper thin and the court scenes are like cheap episodes of ""The Good Wife."" And it works in the shows favour. It's so good because it never once puts on the front of being a good television show. It's trashy and dirty and Viola Davis is absolutely amazing. If you're needing to wind down after a hard day of actual work, tune in to How To Get Away With Murder and enjoy the petty dramas of an oversexed, over-thinking, overdressed cast. The jury is out - How To Get Away With Murder is guilty! Guilty of being pleasurable."
Genius,A show that never fails to surprise.,"This TV show is very well written and has the viewer on the edge of her seat for 43 minutes. I have loved every episode so far, and I really like the characters. Plot twists are, according to me, fantastic. And this show has a lot of them. It never fails to surprise. Law is something I have always found fascinating - you get a new case every week and you get to follow Annalise and her students into court while also getting a glimpse into everyone's personal lives. The characters are alike in many ways, but also very unique. You get to see the relationships between the students, between the adults - and of course, between the students and adults. I have always been a big fan of Shonda, she will continue to do great things."
Genius,Reasonably ok...,"Glorified soap opera...Personally,i would like to see more in depth study of interesting criminal cases ,instead of mostly family,love,gay drama...nevertheless ,ok time killer..."
Genius,My soul feels polluted,"So much nastiness! This show got worse and worse with each season. Sexy, sad and nasty people consistently lie, cheat, scheme and hurt each other, and wonder why they're so miserable. There's not one redeemable character in the series."
Genius,It's simply everything you want from a TV series,"It's the epitome of TV perfection.

With intricate twists, fresh narratives, and multi-dimensional characters, this series keeps you hooked.

Surprises in every episode, from shocking reveals to character arcs, blend suspense with satisfaction.

It's a benchmark in TV excellence, captivating with seamless storytelling, stellar performances, and stunning visuals.

This show lingers in your mind, sparking conversations and theories.

Amidst a sea of options, it shines as a binge-worthy masterpiece that'll keep you enthralled.

I really don't know what to watch now that I've just finished ""How to Get Away with a Murder"""
Genius,must to watch,"For me this series was a rollercoaster. It made me feel angry, sad, happy and proud. I had a great time of watching it that it made me realize a lot about my current life style. I recommend this series for whose who are trying to find the movie which will give them the whole spector of emotions and joy. I give it 10/10 as it made me feel that once it seems to be over, there might be another path.

P.s. Thanks my dearest friend maria who recommended me this and made me a junkie who waits for another free moment to enjoy his doze. For me it was another episode of How to get away with the murder."
Genius,Brilliant performances,"If you are into courtroom battles, injustices and scandals then this is the series. It centres around a professor/defense attorney "" Annalise"" played by the remarkable Viola Davis who teaches first term wannabe law students in the ins and outs of law and many, many trials and tribulations. Certain students are selected to assist Annalise in the day to day investigating of cases that turn up sometimes deadly consequences.

There is a certain "" Breaking Bad"" sequence where future circumstances and scenes are played, this really adds to a well written and played out series.

Rated this 9/10 only because, and my only issue is the complexities of this series cannot be binged watched, and sometimes the outcome of some cases do get predictable, but genuinely in no way does it spoil the whole series.

Again Viola Davis, along with Billy Brown, Aja Naomi King, Liza Weil and Karla Souza really stand out, make this great viewing."

Frontier,It was canceled with no ending...,"Very enjoyable. I was pleased with just about everything. I understood going into it, it was not a History Course at some University. So the inaccuracy didn't bother me. This is not a Documentary nor is it given the loosely labeled true story. Another common criticism was their accents. I didn't care about that either, I'm no linguist. People need to stop expecting an education from Hollywood and just relax and enjoy.

Unfortunately like so many other series it was canceled and canceled without an ending. That's my biggest issue. So if you haven't started watching, don't. You'll be left unfulfilled."
Frontier,Good show but...,The first season was awesome!!! The second and third seasons were ok but the series was left unfinished. Also the night scenes (which there were a lot of) were hard to see and know what was going on. There was was much more that they could have done to make this show better!
Frontier,"S01 OK, S02 OK, S03 WTF?","Series started out OK & I had been looking forward to the 3rd season. However, I quickly lost interest after the first couple episodes. It was too disjointed for me. One messy, unbelievable situation after another was presented in an overly dramatic fashion. Too bad, there were some interesting bits and pieces but no overall coherence."
Frontier,Trying to make Canadian history more dramatic...than it was,"There are some good points to this show, so let's get them out of the way first. It's half-decent acting, scenic locations, an intriguing plot twist that sends the protagonist - by accident - into the New World and straight into a nasty conflict on the colonial frontier. It's also the fact there aren't that many shows about the Canadian fur trade and the rough-and tumble era of early colonization....and this show tries to elevate the profile of our country, so to speak.

OK, onto the flaws and problems. The history, as is depicted on film here, was never this interesting or this violent, this 'sexy"". It is hard to find actual accounts of armed confrontations between different fur traders or these episodes of almost guerrila warfare in the boreal bush. So, 'Frontier' is using some seriously creative licence here. Also, lot of the characters are cast as inept, drunk, corrupt or morally deficient...or combination of all. They steal and kill, almost at will. I understand that the show's creators were keen on portraying conflict; let's at least try to portray conflict realistically. One had to be competent to stay alive and prosper on the frontier. Things like trying to kidnap a chief's son (in order to force a tribe to negotiate) would have been exceedingly stupid. And the folks who ruled the colony still ruled it...by a rule of law. The setting looks like it's supposed to be somewhere in the northern Laurentians in Quebec but could also be northern Ontario...but is actually Newfoundland. We are not told at the onset as to what year it is. Big mistake in my opinion. Doing a period piece requires an attention to detail. For instance, an English officer in a redcoat, even in the wilds, would have worn longish hair in a pony-tail or perhaps a wig, and no beards would have been seen on any of these men, in the late 1700s and very early 1800s. The French Canadian and Metis trappers and fur dealers would have had a very specific look to them, as well. A woman running the bar at the company fort would not have worn trousers - maybe for riding a horse but never for work in a public place. Also, no matter how much a governor of a fort would have screwed up, he would not have been murdered/summarily executed by another big official. It's too outlandish. At worst, they would have been sent back to England and 'retired' with some kind of a pension and told to shut up. Anyways, a lot of creative license is at work here, with trying to make the Hudson's Bay Company and its times seem more interesting and more dramatic than it really was."
Frontier,Entertaining!,"Frontier is an extremely entertaining show, as long as you don't compare it to other shows (i.e. GoT, Vikings, etc)! So what if the accents aren't great & it's not absolutely historically accurate, if you just turn your brain off and take it for what it is and that's an action packed thriller where Jason Momoa is terrific as the lead!"
Frontier,It's entertaining,"The first couple of seasons are good but the third season is anticlimactic. Here are the issues I have with the show: 1.The episodes mention the location of every scene but you'll have no idea otherwise.

2.Jason Momoa as charismatic as he is offers no character development like all characters. He justifies his character, the same can't be said for a few others.

3.the accents oh my god, the accents. The Spanish sailer in the third season and the French broker have especially disappointing dialogue deliveries.

4. The third season sucked balls. That's all I can say without spoiling it for the rest of you. I was hoping for some sort of plot but they just seemed to be winging it like the good ol' bollywood movies.

Bottomline: it's good enough to Netflix and chill"
Frontier,Underrated,"Frontier is so much better than I expected. While it's not the best show I've ever seen it's definitely one of the most underrated shows I've seen. Jason Momoa is absolutely fantastic here. It takes place in Canada during the fur trade of the 1700's. It follows Declan Harper (Jason Momoa) as he tried to make his living through the fur trade. He's an outlaw leading a campaign against Hudson's Bay Company, who has a monopoly on the fur trade. The company will literally do anything to maintain its stranglehold on the fur business and is out to get rid of Declan Harper. It's a very entertaining show that you'll have a good time watching."
Frontier,one star,"In 1670, King Charles II granted Hudson's Bay Company vast lands creating a dominant fur trading monopoly. By late 1700's, other interests seek to increase their slice of the pie. Lord Benton (Alun Armstrong), feared ruthless company leader, is on his way back to the New World to stop his old protege Irish-Native outlaw Declan Harp (Jason Momoa). Declan is trying to unite various factions to fight against The HBC. Sokanon is his native supporter. Michael Smyth and Clenna Dolan are trying to steal gun powder from a British ship when they get stuck on board going to the New World. Benton sends Michael out to lure Declan into a trap but he is converted to Declan's cause. Grace Emberly is the local tavern owner. Captain Chesterfield tries to take over while appeasing Benton's obsessions. Elizabeth Carruthers takes over her dead husband's Montreal business.

The ambition is big and it may be too big. Jason Momoa shows his star quality. I like most of the actors. The story gets a bit clunky. The bigger issue is that it wants to tell a vast story. It's set in many places. It skips over time and travel which makes the plotting even more ragged. Despite being problematic, Momoa's star quality continues to shine and it makes the show intriguing."
Frontier,Fantastic and Underrated,"I can't believe it's been cancelled. I thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I thought the acting, writing, and directing were all on point. Sad to see that it won't continue."
Frontier,"Not extraordinary, but entertaining","Particularly if you are a fan of Jason Momoa, this show is worth checking out. If you like seeing examples of colonial-era British forces getting stood up to, frontiersmen doing frontier stuff, First Nations tribesmen doing their best to survive against European encroachment, and cool looking costumes and settings, then it's worth checking out. It's not for the faint of heart, however. The fights are violent and bloody and there is plenty of torture and abuse of women and PoC by Europeans."
Frontier,Fun,"Stopped paying attention to critics, and go by word of mouth. I heard this was good, and enjoyed watching Momoa. If I've had fun watching a series, been intrigued, and binge, it's good enough for me. The actors were well chosen, accents a bit funky, but the settings and costumes for this genre made it worth watching."
Frontier,A new fan!,"I was not a Momoa's fan by any means... But I found this series in netflix and I gave it a chance... I was very impressed but with his acting... He's great in it.... His voice, tone, physical language is on point... The only think I'm disappointed is the actress that play ""Grace""... She has cero chemistry with Jason and their scenes are dull and boring because of that.They should've choose someone with chemistry with Jason."
Frontier,Going nowhere fast,"This show is impressively simple. The overall setting surrounding the main plot could have made for some very interesting, informative and vicious entertainment. Instead, it appears to be absolutely boiled down to it's simplest possible parts.

Scriptwise, it is almost like ""how not to"" tutorial for new writers. The main plot, which is supposed to be the focus lies vaguely in the background. Several minor and ultimately meaningless and uninteresting subplots are forced in for intrigue. Four or five different factions all have several subordinate characters with their separate alliances which intermingle to farcical proportions. It is obviously meant to increase depth and drama for all the characters but in a transparently shallow and meaningless way.

Character interactions are not believable and the characters themselves are extremely stereotypical. All the male characters have grossly primitive motivations and actions, and nearly all female characters are strong independent agents to a historically anachronistic and revisionist degree.

The only group that has anything close to a serious treatment is the native tribe. The matriarch and lead warrior of the tribe have predictable but fair parts. Jason Momoa repeats his character from Game of Thrones and does it well as far as that goes. Landon Liboiron's part is nothing more than a Watson, slipping effortlessly around to explain and elaborate for the viewer, unnecessarily so. The whole thing would have been better suited as a film when the padding and filler stand out so painfully obvious."
Frontier,Expected something better,"Frontier is a Netflix Canadian series about a group of Cree Indians led by Declan Harp played by Jason Momoa who is half Cree half Irish. The storyline surrounds the brutal slater of his people by the Hudson Bay Co who monopolized the fur trade industry in Canada. Set in the 1700s in the Hudson Bay Area at Fort James British military stronghold. Of all the shows and movies I have watched that Momoa play in, I got to say this was the worst. This was not a strong script, and the acting was sub par, I expected better. The story is similar to The Last Of The Mohicans but this series was awful. I wish it ended with one season but it kept dragging and going thru the motions. Landon Liboiron, Greg Bryk, Jessica Matten, Zoe Boyle, along with Katie McGrath and Alun Armstrong round up the cast. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this series, it was boring and not eventful."
Frontier,I hope there won't be only 1 season!,"I really don't understand the critics...As a big fan of historical dramas, I could really say they did a great job with this show. There may be some inaccuracies but don't forget it's not a documentary. The story line is quite interesting- made me watch all episodes in 2 nights. Kudos to the actors as well! It reminds me a bit of Assassin's creed III which is also awesome. So yeah...I hope they won't leave it with just 1 season....but knowing the popularity of those kinds of shows, out of the mainstream- I won't be surprised if Frontier follows the fate of other great canceled historical dramas as The Borgias, Copper, Da Vinci's Demons, etc. Best of luck!"
Frontier,Hudson Bae,"Finally finished off the third season of ""Frontier"" having left it for a long time. It was one of the earlier Netflix shows that we started, at a time when new shows were less frequently produced by the streaming giant.

Declan Harp (Jason Momoa) wages a crusade against the Hudson Bay Company, the largest fur trading company in the world, focused around the operations at Fort James in Canada. His conviction stems from his hatred of Lord Benson (Alun Armstrong) Fort James' commanding officer, whom Harp once worked for but who betrayed him and murdered his family. Harp is assisted by Michael Smith (Landon Liboiron) a recent arrival from England but whose loyalties and ambitions are questionable.

I enjoyed ""Frontier"" enough, though I'd accept it's a stage below other historical dramas like ""The Last Kingdom"" or ""Vikings"". The money spent on the show is comparable, in terms of historical recreation, but it's a much tighter and more focused story, in terms of the characters, so there's no large scale battles to compare the shows on. Momoa is, as always a charismatic and watchable lead and his size and athletic prowess feature heavily. Liboiron is given more of the plot to deal with, as it's his story for the larger part and also featuring heavily is Zoe Boyle - as Grace, the tavern owner who manoeuvres both sides like a beautiful Scottish Al Sweregen.

At the time of writing this review, the show has not been officially cancelled, but it's been 18 months sinc the last season was released on Netflix and looks unlikely to return. For anyone concerned about starting the show, the conclusion does work as an end to the overall story, in the sense we're not left with any unanswered cliffhangers. To be honest, unlike say ""The Last Kingdom"" which I still actively enjoy, I finished ""Frontier"" out of a sense of obligation. It's only 18 episodes long, so if historical drama is your thing certainly give it a try, just don't expect it to match the best of the genre."

Frontier,Standard Historical Drama That's Thoroughly Enjoyable!,"Being in the 'standard' class of historical dramas these days is by no means a bad thing. It means you're going to get gritty sets, well-crafted period clothing, adult-oriented content, great cinematography and plenty of action.

If you're an armchair historian with a penchant for modern History Channel embellishment, and enjoy shows like 'The Musketeers', 'Da Vinci's Demons', 'Banished', 'Black Sails', 'TURN: Washington's Spies', etc., you're bound to enjoy 'Frontier'.

You certainly don't need to be Canadian to enjoy this show - it takes place roughly 100 years before Canadian Confederation, and follows the wars between upstart frontiersmen with a wavering corporate monopoly. It's the kind of cathartic scenario many around the world may enjoy as corporations continue to widen the gulf between 'us' and 'them'.

As with all of these 'standard' historical dramas, the acting is well done given their sometimes clunky modernized dialogue, and as these actors originate from several countries (production tax credits?) accents are often out of sync.

You might also expect to see gratuitousness for the sake of it, as it's not only a quicker writing choice to drive conflict, but when you have the option to be as graphic as you want FINALLY in mainstream fair, why not exercise the option? In a visceral sense it IS more realistic.

In my opinion, only two things separate truly 'world-class' historical dramas from the 'standard' ones like 'Frontier': Intricately interwoven story-lines that have wide arcs and flawless casting. Both I imagine require more time and money than these studios can supply given their budgets, and some weird alchemy that's unquantifiable.

Despite the flaws you and I might see in 'Frontier' and shows in its category, everyone involved has done an amazing job crafting and populating this world, and you very well might enjoy it.

While most of my criticisms have been on the writing, there's really no reason for criticism. 'Frontier' follows a tried-and-tested formula that works, and for what the writing aims to accomplish, it accomplishes. Yes there's little hope to grasp at yet in the story, but we may very well get there in Season 1. Bear in mind that the history we're given of these times is murky at best, so it must be very difficult to design the world in a truly authentic way. I'm hoping we're given enough time to see these characters, and the world develop.

With enough time, inspiration and creative leeway, I'm confident the writers could have taken us down a truly original path for this show. Perhaps more contemplative, akin to 'The Revenant'? As it stands, this was a great, safe choice for Discovery to launch its originally-scripted division, and I hope it performs well. I've always dreamed of a well-produced historical drama set in Canada before Confederation (as odd as that sounds), and I got one! Keep it up Discovery!"
Frontier,Decent show,"I watched the first season (6 episodes) and it was entertaining enough so no regrets, but I think I'll move on to other shows. There's just not anything special about it.

The setting of British-Canadian fur trapper era is the most interesting part of it. Unfortunately the plot line is mostly the same old chase-catch-release with some interpersonal drama mixed in.

The writing and plot twists are all fairly obvious, nothing that really surprises and the romantic matchmaking can be seen from a mile away. The sets feel like they're on a sound stage about 80% of the time and the acting gets overly dramatic at times like watching a play.

It's one of those ""pretty good"" shows that are not quite good enough in the ocean of content that is now being made available."
Frontier,Apparently no one likes period pieces.,Comentario no disponible
Frontier,Not the northern Black Sails all right,"One can't help but get Black Sails vibes right from the intro and I believe that was planned. Yet, it is slightly incoherent, with Indians rowing in canoe footage being completely out of place for one and the Mexican standoff possibly based on historical events and what could possibly be pictured in consecutive seasons, rather than what was actually pictured.

And here goes my typical I don't like Jason Momoa. At all. But he doesn't bug me here. In fact, he's fine. It's just I can't help but like how Cobbs Pond and Lord Benton were portrayed much more. It's a matter of personal preference, I guess, but these two were played brilliantly. I absolutely dig all the accents and most of the characters are in fact great. Maybe except Sokanon. I could not stand her always deeply depressed face. Seasons one and two are fine, season three is quite weak in my book and episodes opening with quotes that are completely irrelevant to time and events is a questionable decision to say the least. In fact, it annoyed the crap out of me. Conclusion was actually cleverly made. It both leaves the gate open for a sequel and at the same time draws the line. Feels like they knew season four is unlikely right from the start. Still, a good watch. Just not that great."
Frontier,Shatters any sense of immersion,"The setting (and cast) for this show has so much potential yet time and again I found myself jarred out of the story by lazy writing and research. I wanted to feel engrossed in the story, instead I winced at the 20th century slang, poorly researched accents, basic historical errors, and stereotyped characters. I'm not looking for a documentary, but it's difficult to emotionally invest in a series when you're constantly evicted from any state of immersion. What's left is just another predictable and clichéd fantasy drama which feels cheap and tacky."

Frontier,"Stop crying about GoT, enjoy the show","The show is really entertaining, I don't know if the show follows the history and I don't really care about that. I read some of the critics and I'm curious how some people can judge the show about the accents. The show have great shots and the actors are very good, the costumes and the plot are perfect with the whole environment Also the accents fits great with the show bcs every country have a different way to speak English and we all know that. Don't compare every series you watch with GoT. GoT is over , stop crying and enjoy the new shows Perfect work , waiting for more episodes."

The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,I feel sorry for the competitors,"The other 2 reviews here have pretty much said it all. The hosts are annoying and if i were one of the competitors, i would not be very pleasant when they make their stupid and insensitive remarks. As for the judges, they could learn a lot from Paul Hollywood and Pru; they are kind with their remarks when they judge. Benoit and Cherish are not and they are way too over the top with their attitudes. They are critical beyond belief when one factors in the time required to finish their pieces. Which leads me to another point - where the hell did they come up with the test pieces? It's like they WANT them to fail with the ridiculous requirements. I finally just skipped to the finale so as to quit torturing myself."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Meh,"Overall it's enjoyable enough to watch. I do enjoy seeing the final desserts. That being said, there's not much more praise. The hosts are cringey as hell. Their bits are absolutely awful and pretty hard to watch. I don't find them amusing or funny in the slightest. As for the judges, they are a bit overzealous and pretentious. Their critiques aren't always constructive. I feel like if you're gonna roast someone's dessert, at least provide tangible feedback. Finally, there's not much joy like you'd expect from the Great British Bake Off. You don't really fall in love with the characters. I'm simply just watching at this point because I'm tired of watching YouTube."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Not a patch on the original,"Taken on its own, this show is okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it after seeing one series. But it really fails in comparison to the original. The format is fine, pairs of professionals competing instead of individual amateurs. The judges are okay, maybe a bit overly critical as others have noted, but don't have the chemistry of Paul and Pru or Mary. But the biggest negative is the presenters. Liam Charles is a former Great British Baking Show contestant but doesn't really use that experience to add anything here and he comes across as a bit silly. That has a lot to do with his co-presenter, Tom Allen. Allen is possibly the most annoying person I've seen on television. He manages to make nearly every bit or interaction with the contestants be about himself. And not in the least bit funny or charming way. More like a bratty kid constantly shrieking ""look at me."" He makes the show nearly unwatchable."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Could be better.,"I love the original version of this show, however...I find Tom so annoying that I have to fast-forward, to avoid his stupid comments. Why does he have to make everything sexual? I'm not a prude, I'm a gay man and I find his innuendos ridiculous and childish, it's really distracting and it's obvious that he's annoying the chefs too.

I say... get rid of him and the show would appeal to more people.

The classical music is a little too much at times, I guess they don't have to pay royalties on it?

Overall, I enjoyed the show, the judges were entertaining, at times a little harsh, but fair!

I'm always puzzled why they don't seem to have air conditioning In these shows, the chocolate is always melting and the chefs/bakers are always saying 'it's too warm in here' I'd watch another series."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Love the Show,"I absolutely love the show. Love the Judges and Liam. Can't Stand Tom!

He's disgusting and so inappropriate. Maybe it's because I'm an American but all his comments come back to sex.

I usually watch GBBO with my granddaughter but I can't with him.

I look forward to seeing Liam and his wonderful personality. He's very professional but funny too.

The Judges are great also. They seem very stern but are actually very fair and can be fun. I like that they always have something nice to say too.

I hope the show get renewed and also is shown on Netflix so us in America can continue to enjoy it.

Highly Recommend!!"
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Very short on actual baking,"I guess I enjoyed this enough as an interlude to the original, there is a lot missing. The pluses...loved seeing Liam. The judges don't bother me - they're judging professionals rather than amateurs, they should be harsher imo.

But let's be real. They should have named this Confections, Chocolate, and Sugar Work. There is very little actual baking. Where are the cakes? The bread? Other baked good? I may be misremembering, but iir, there are a couple of episodes with zero actual baking.

In any case, I'd rank this as ""fine"" but don't expect a version of its namesake. Other than the format, this ain't it."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Pretentious downer,"There is nothing if the great British show in this. This show is a pretentious downer with none of the positivity and fun and lighthearted goodness of the great British baking show. Paul and Prue are smart and friendly and supportive; They're fair and compassionate. The judges here come off as elitist, unconcerned for the contestants, and sometimes downright mean. There is no joy of cooking. There is no love of the art. Perhaps on its own it could me a middling competition show but it's attempts to tie itself to the great British baking show seem like a crass marketing ploy to give this less than average show a sense of respectability."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Terrific contestants,"Terrific contestants. Pretty sure I've watched every season of its first series. And I really loved this professional issue as they did the greatest job at finding contestants. First time I actually got teary when they named the winners. Because honestly they were all so good right down to the final three.

They were creative and fun. So many of their creations were just brilliant. I've tried and tried to find the white chocolate teacups and saucer with an orange cake in it on-line. Each thing they made was so complex and it was just very very inspiring.

I enjoyed it over a couple of weeks and it really got quite suspenseful!!"
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Enough with the Harry Potter music!,"The show is interesting enough despite the head judge whose accent is very thick. The hosts are irritating at first but they grow on you. The most irritating aspect of the whole show is the annoying Harry Potter-like music that plays every time they show what the contestants are making. Ugh! A little variety would have been nice. It gets annoying really quickly. Otherwise, the use of classic music is very nice.

As far as the competition goes, however, the creations are artistic, dramatic and sometimes spectacular. There is the usual drama of show pieces collapsing. The judges seem to be fair in their eliminations."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,"Rewatch GBBO, pass on this","It's really too bad, Liam was charming on his season of the real show, but stacked against the bald doofus and the overanimated judges, he doesn't stand a chance.

The worst part of all of this is that after 2 episodes I don't know much at all about the chefs, because the 2 judges devour center stage. The woman is just loud, and the guy is fine till he likes something, then it's ""boom *mic drop* boom BOOM"" ridiculously.

Also, the male judge is French. Does he or the gal not know the difference between Macarons, a French delicacy, and Macaroons, an American invention?

I watched because I thought Paul & Prue would be working with other professionals. The chefs have the short end of the stick here, it's a waste of their time and talent. Skip it."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Great baking show with talented competitors,"I think this baking show is great! The competitors are incredibly talented, and they consistently impress me with their baking skills and creativity. The judges on the show are clearly knowledgeable about baking and pastry, and they are generally fair in their evaluations of the contestants' creations except final decision in season 6. While they can be a bit over-critical and pretentious at times, I can usually see their point of view, and I appreciate that they don't show as much favoritism towards certain contestants like other shows. Although I've come across some negative reviews of the show, I don't understand them at all. In my experience, the hosts aren't nearly as annoying as some people make them out to be. Sure, they can be a bit childish, but I don't find it overwhelming or distracting."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Just okay,"Being a longtime fan of GBBS I had high hopes, especially since series 5 home baker Liam is a cohost, but it didn't live up to the original.

The judges are kind of snarky and the contestants, who are supposed to be professionals, don't even live up to the standards of the home bakers on the original show. They have two people, working in commercial kitchens and the creations they produce aren't as beautifully done as I would expect. It definitely gives me more respect for the home bakers on GBBS who work in a tent with a small work area, no blast chillers, huge commercial ovens, or professional tools and turn out the most beautiful creations all on their own.

This show is okay as something to watch when there's nothing else on and you're craving some British baking, but not much else."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,"Professionals interesting, judges and hosts not","This is a slightly different format than the other baking shows of the same name. Different judges and different hosts- one of which you may recognize as a contestant from the great British baking show/bake off, Liam.

The judges are actually professional chefs, but definitely not professional actors. For some reason their dialogue is scripted and their mannerisms and speech are over the top ridiculous, but not in a comical way- just cringe and robotic.

The hosts are a whole animal of their own. While I like Liam's personality when he's just being himself, him playing host is pretty bad to watch. The other host, Tom Allen is supposed to be an actor. He's worse than Liam (if possible) and honestly just unbearable to watch. I got a taste of him on Great British baking show holidays and thought ""surely he can't be this awful, maybe some writer screwed him over?"". I wish I'd been right. He is terrible and between the hosts and judges, this one is nearly unwatchable. If not for the excellent creations by the chefs, this would be trash. I can foresee it getting cancelled anyway."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Better after Tom...,"I wish there was more focus on the baking. In the original GBBO we saw the whole process. This show, while there are fun elements, focuses on the decoration and assembly more. Tom Allen is so over the top and annoying. Stacey replacing him in series 7 was amazing. I thought she was adorable and added a more real element to the hosts. Liam is charming on his own but when paired with Tom his usual charm falls flat. He and Stacey together is a much better pair. Benoit and Cherish are a bit over the top but I love it. They find the good and the bad in each bake and I appreciate their efforts to give advice and praise when they can."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Not good...,"I was excited to see this series pop up on Netflix since I'm a huge fan of the original GBBO series and I also loved Liam as a contestant so I was happy that he landed a gig as a host on one of the show spin-offs. That's about as exciting as this show gets. I agree with what the other reviewers have said here, the judges on this show are terrible. They're arrogant, mean, and WAY too critical of what these bakers create. There's no fun or lightheartedness here like in the original series, there's no chemistry between the judges and contestants and unfortunately as much as I love Liam, he doesn't have the greatest chemistry with the other co-host. I'll finish the show to the end, but I'd be surprised if this one gets any more seasons..."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,AWFUL,The show pales in comparison to the original. The chefs at times are practically impossible to understand and other times are pretentious and annoying. I really feel badly for the competitors. I even advanced through episodes to see if it got any better further into the series and unfortunately it did not. The poor joke writing and awkward delivery come off as insults rather than playful levity or fun banter. The hosts don't even seem to have a connection with each other. The set up of the show is fine and it seems there was care in choosing competitors that were very watchable and at a knowledge level of professional... it's a shame I couldn't get through the annoying parts to actually watch it.

The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Judges,"The judges are terrible. You can not understand them and they truly believe they are above the chefs. The show is about the talents of the chefs not them and their showmanship. Please replace the judges. Paul Hollywood and prue leith would make fantastic judges...please please change them. I would pay to change them. Thw premise of the show is absolutely mesmerizing. I love watching the chefs create masterful showpieces. Thats the fun part till its time for judging, then thats where the show starts to taste horrible, no pun intended. The showpieces are always exciting and i am sure taste great to us common folks, not to the showmanship taste of the judge's. Please upgrade the show and get rid of the judges."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Terrible and rude judges,"Cherish and Benoit should be banned from ever being judges again. They were rude, hateful and demoralizing to the contestants and made for an uncomfortable viewing experience. The challenges were interesting and the contestants were very qualified. I was looking forward to an imaginative and instructive program and all I got was the egotism and snark of the judges. They moved quite a few contestants to tears, and these were professionals! The Great British Baking Show has been known for humor, kindness, and lots of information about baking. These judges were a horrid mistake and should never appear again."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Hosts are Annoying,"Whoever wrote the scripts for the hosts should be relieved of duty. Their antics ruined the show for me and they were utterly unnecessary and very annoying. They acted like children. Stupid games throwing food, disappearing game. Every so often they called themselves judges, but the 2 who actually commented to contestants about flavor were more interesting to watch.

Would have rather watched the judges.

If you are going to make a show using professionals, perhaps make sure they are skilled at most of these skills.

Also, did you guys have a chef so these tasks to make sure they were actually doable?"
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Bad Replica of the original Great British Baking Show,"I can not understand half of what the judges are saying because of their accents. They are overly animated especially the Asian woman. Liam is not a comedic host. I did not like his mannerisms when he was a contestant on The Great British Baking Show and they do not translate to being a television host. I have watched three episodes and I believe I am done with the show.

Unbelievably they require an obsurd amount of characters within this review box, so I am going to just add a bunch of letters until I fill this comment section. Ghjgdeyjvccftihvfdyokvdr368hv358jvr46ibcs2590jvxsyjbcr68jvx4fhu."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Inept Hosts and Condescending Judges,"What a waste of the talents of the chefs having to pout up with the trivial childish antics of the hosts. Even more disappointing was the verbal abuse the judges Benoit and Cherish piled on the chefs. The chefs were given inadequate time to complete masterpieces and novel pastries and then given incredibly poor feedback and ratings, to the point of it being a personal derision of their talents. Furthermore, it was so difficult to understand what the chefs were being asked to create and even more difficult to understand what then judges were saying.

Please find other hosts (Paul and Pru) if you plan to air future episodes!!"
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Zero personality or charisma. Simply horrible,"I honestly do not know how this show was able to have six seasons so far on British television. The hosts and judges have no chemistry or personality and those are the big elements and charm of the original program (excluding Matt). This program is clearly just ripping off from the brand name. I was excited to see your beautiful, pastries, and mine blowing showstoppers when I saw that professional pastry chef's were participating, but the judge is in horrible, acting by the hosts completely ruin it.

No point in watching it to the end. Halfway through the season, it starts over with another ""heat"" of teams, meaning strangers instead of knowing the chefs more so you are compelled to root for one more. Another important part of the original show that is lost in this nonsense."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,Hard to watch,"I love the Great British baking show, as well as the other spin-offs. I don't know if the idea is to hold the professionals up to a whole new standard but it seems that no one ever gets good reviews. The two judges have over the top personalities and I always feel it's like they're trying to prove that they know so much about baking, which I'm sure that they do. But it just feels like they're both trying to perfect their own version of snarkiness. To my American sensibilities, it seems very unkind. And what I love the most about the Great British baking show is that there is always a sense of class and civility among the contestants and the judges. I find this sorely missing in this version. By contrast, Paul Hollywood can be critical but he is always lovable or at least likable. The two judges on the show are just a plain old no. That said, I am sure that they make some of the best pastry in Great Britain. I would love to eat what they make but I certainly wouldn't want to cross paths with them at a cocktail party."
The Great British Baking Show: The Professionals,None of the charm of the original.,"There's no heart to this program at all. No personality.

Or, none that's appealing. Aside from the Romanian couple, everyone was flat. Even the hosts bring nothing good. One's OK, but the wannabe style icon is really annoying and brings no value, adds nothing worthwhile. Even the judges are boring and have no charisma. It's all very repetitive as well.

The music drives me nuts, it's so intrusive. I'd far rather hear the contestants than saccharine renditions of tired classics at high volumes.

Overall, I was hoping to see a more professional version of the original show but they left out thebest parts and what's left is flat."
The Wonder,great coming-of-age show,"An older Kevin Arnold (Daniel Stern) recounts his childhood in suburbia. The Vietnam war is raging. The young Kevin (Fred Savage) has his annoying brother Wayne (Jason Hervey), rebellious sister Karen (Olivia d'Abo), housewife mother Norma (Alley Mills) and father Jack (Dan Lauria). His best friend is nerdy Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano) and there is the suddenly blossoming girl-next-door Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar).

It's an iconic award winning series that affected other shows. Fred Savage is utterly adorable as a child actor and it's a classic coming-of-age TV show. It's all great. The show lasted 6 seasons. It definitely has more trouble once it gets to high school. Kevin turns more angry, and less likable. Quite frankly, he's a selfish jerk. Winnie Cooper gets faded out in the middle seasons for some unknown reason. Paul gets the same treatment during the later years. This is a mistake. This is as much their show as it is Kevin's show. Their friendships is the heart of the show. I would love to have more Becky Slater for the fun although I didn't know about the sisters back in the day. That's not to say that the high school years are a bust. Even with its inherent darkness, there are some outstanding individual episodes. Frank and Denise remains one of my favorites in the entire show. That episode is poetic and I can still remember it all the way to the end. It's too bad that it couldn't make that transition because the first few seasons are the best of TV."
The Wonder,Best Family Show of All Time - The Wonder Years,"The writing for this show was outstanding. The actors and actresses were solid and the storylines, the vast majority of the time, were engrossing. It is interesting to note that the show changed quite a bit from year to year, but was rather stable the last two seasons. The transition from childhood to junior high was very good; much better than the high school sequences. We have all seen several high school situations in both film and TV that were funnier or more dramatic than Wonder Years, but the seasons that featured the transition from grade school to junior high (6-9) really hit the mark.

The continuous on again, off again relationship between Kevin and Winnie was sometimes annoying and confusing. After all, it was Kevin who strayed first with another girl. Why would'nt Winnie play the field? Josh Saviano seemed to be downplayed in the later seasons in favor of Giovanni Rabisi, who seemed to be more height-apporpriate for Kevin's best friend. Height was always a problem for the producers of this show.. Although Savage was a pleasing performer; he was quite short; over a head length shorter than McGregor. With Saviano towering over Savage as well, it seemed the show was about Snow White and one dwarf. One other aspect of the show that was a stretch (no pun intended), was a bevy of older, gorgeous women falling for Kevin; I don't think so. Dwarves are cute, but not boyfriend cute. Fortunately, for Savage, he had a growth spurt which allowed him to have later season scenes with Winnie and even Paul. Despite these shortcomings (sorry), the show was still a major success because the writing was just so good, that it overcame all of these minor flaws."
The Wonder,Still a very enjoyable TV show,"As someone who lived in suburbia and attended middle school and high school during the late 1960's and early 1970's, I identify with much that I see in ""The Wonder Years."" Like the show's narrator, I, too, remember counterculture students and status quo school administrators; devoted, optimistic homemakers and overworked, short-tempered fathers; adamant supporters of the space program and U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and advocates of social welfare and world peace; adherents to the sanctity of marriage and the traditional family, and those influenced by the women's liberation movement and the sexual revolution. I also remember middle and high school relationships and same-sex friendships, and some situations in ""The Wonder Years"" don't jibe with what with I knew.

Some people might tell me that in the name of entertainment I should accept a few of the less plausible scenes -- Kevin Arnold's getting tagged in the hall between classes with a round house right by the girl he opposed in a school election, for example -- and not look for a television show to accurately emulate life as I have experienced it. Because of the narrator's tone in some situations, however, I get the feeling that the makers of ""The Wonder Years"" expect the audience to take what they see and hear seriously, though I find myself thinking, ""This would not have happened,"" usually in response to whenever Kevin and Winnie, as middle-schoolers, share some exclusive time.

A physically mature 7th or 8th grader might kiss his girlfriend on the mouth, not the much more youthful, innocent pre-adolescent who could pass as a 5th-grader, such as Kevin Arnold of the show's first couple of seasons. I generally don't see anything wrong with Fred Savage's and Danika McKellar's acting, but in those romantic scenes when the two embrace they come across more as two children attempting to behave like adults rather than two precocious kids acting on their feelings for each other.

I don't have the same reaction to Winnie's and Kevin's romance when, as 17-18 year-olds, they watch a movie at the local cinema, study together at the kitchen table, or argue through some misunderstanding. In any case, the episodes including Paul, and especially those involving more significantly a member of Kevin Arnold's family -- his mother's pursuit of work outside the home and the brother's decision to forsake college and marry instead both moved me -- tend to suspend my disbelief."
The Wonder,One of the most memorable television programs of recent years,"When I think about the programs that my family enjoyed when my brother and I were younger, this one always comes off as the most memorable, mainly because my family spent quality time together watching this show. Now, at 20 years old, this show is still as memorable and holds up against the test of time.

""The Wonder Years"" is a period dramedy told from the point-of-view of adult Kevin Arnold (narration of Daniel Stern), and recalls Kevin's adolescence during the turbulent times of the late 1960s and 1970s. Kevin (played brilliantly by Fred Savage) comes of age in suburbia in a neighborhood that many of our parents (including my mom) grew up in. Kevin lives in a ranch house with his parents, Jack (Dan Lauria), an accountant, Norma (Alley Mills) a housewife, and his older siblings, hippie Karen (Olivia D'Abo) and smart-alecky Wayne (Jason Hervey). He has a childhood sweetheart in Gwendolyne ""Winnie"" Cooper (Danica McKellar), and a best friend in lovable geek Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano). Kevin deals with normal situations that is territorial with adolesence--first loves, heartbreak, middle school, high school, puberty, and growing up. Kevin grows up in uncertain times, much like children are today. Each episode is a chapter in Kevin's life, and follows him between the ages of 13 and 18--the most crucial years of growing up.

When this show was made, they definitely looked at the lives of teenagers. The characters were realistic, and no matter when you grew up, you could relate. Everyone could relate to Kevin, and many felt his adolescent pain. You knew your parents were overburdening, but realized later that they were only trying to help you. Everyone had a sibling like Wayne, and possibly like Karen.

I'm a product of the 1980s, and being born in 1982 put me out of the loop in regard to what the 1960s and 1970s were really like. My parents came of age in this decade, so they easily related to Kevin. The situations were comical, and this show was always good, clean fun. The humor wasn't overburdening, but it was evident, and we always laughed, but it also impacted you and made you think after it was all over. This show premired when my brother and I were only 5, and we watched it with our parents every week until it went off the air. I don't think this show ever was capable of cancellation, but it went out the way it was intended, and it left an indellible impression on this generation. When the reruns returned to television on Nick-at-Nite in 1998, my classmates and I, already in ninth grade, began to watch again. Now, I'm a sophomore in college, and if I can catch the reruns on ABC Family during the week, I'm thrilled. I truly miss this show, and watching reruns brings back great memories.

I don't have a favorite episode or memory--I have many favorite episodes and memories. Two of the moments that I can still remember vividly are when Winnie's older brother died in Vietnam and Kevin and Winnie shared their first kiss, and when Kevin's math teacher died. My mom, brother, and I always used to laugh (and still do) at my dad, who resembles Jack Arnold. We could be talking about something funny during dinner, and my father will sit there, stone-faced, much like Jack always did. I used to love when they'd ask him a question, and he would utter a low growl. While my dad has NEVER done that, he has always resembled Jack. Only now, several years later, he finds it funny that we thought that of him.

This was a wonderful show that never wore out its welcome, and continues to entertain those who catch the reruns. If you have the chance in your hectic day, as I sometimes do, catch a rerun or set your VCR to tape an episode for you. Relive a classic television program that continues to entertain and inspire years later. You certainly won't regret it."
The Wonder,Nostalgia Hurts,"I have never had so much fun watching TV before or after ""The wonder years"". Kevin Arnold and Winnie Cooper were my friends and I could not possible imagine life without them. So many years after the show ended when I saw Kevin Arnold's pic in one of my friends computer screen NOSTALGIA did HURT. I mean it brought back memories of the yesteryears. It was very easy to relate to everything that Kevin was going through although I was from another world in India. His love interest the cute Winnie Cooper made it all the more interesting. Loved his best friend, though he did look like a nerd. I specially remembered a scene when Kevin kissed Winnie in the beach. Saying this might sound like saying a lot but it is just the truth. Sometimes the show seemed to me more important the books that I studied in school. A tutorial. It will always be close to my heart and fondly remembered. I can assume its like this for many of us around the world. Miss you Kevin."
The Wonder,A lesson of life delivered by entertainment.,"This is without a doubt one of the best serious programs that mixed humor and the style of sitcoms in history of American t.v.

Who didn't have a geeky friend that would always embarrass you like Paul? Who didn't have a crush like Beck? Or what about the unexpected crush from another super sexy girl? On the more serious aspects, who didn't have a discussion that could harm a family member? What about dealing with death, love, projects of school?

This show displayed the truth of life but only in a funnier way. I grew up watching Kevin and company dealing with the problems of diary life.

I personally find this to be the most complete drama-comedy show of the past 20 years. You won't find another visual experience like this.

It's like, remembering your childhood-puberty years through the eyes and memory of Kevin.

This show made me laugh, cry, reflex, and best of all, it brought me sensations of my life; you know, memories, smells, specific situations, etc. It's like a reproduction of my life through someone else's narration.

Also, the opening song is stuff for legend."
The Wonder,On my top 10 show list!,Comentario no disponible
The Wonder,A show for all ages,"Wonder years is a rarity among the modern day sitcoms. To be honest, i have never seen anything like this my whole life. It tells the story of young Kevin Arnold(Fred Savage) between the time he starts junior high and finishes high school. The whole series is presented to the viewer as a narration. Kevin lives in a quiet suburb with his family. His childhood sweetheart Winnie Cooper (Danica McKellar) and Paul Pfieffer(Josh Saviano) live next door, with whom he spends most of his time. This show made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me think about friendship and family bonding. It reminded me of my childhood and about the things which i did and did not. Altogether, a wonderful experience for the young and the old alike. I am sorry that this great show has not made a debut on DVD because of licensing issues. I hope some day the producers would release the DVD so that this dramatic gem is not lost in the tides of time. If you get an opportunity to watch a taped version, don't miss it..."
The Wonder,The years that make you wonder...,"I was born in 1980, so by 1988 I was still a little young (8yrs old) and not interested in TV other than cartoons. When I started watching this amazing show in the mid 90s (when the series was officially over but had reruns going nonstop) I was so taken by it. Not because it made me reflect on my childhood (because I was right smack in the middle of it) but because I had a big crush on Winnie and it was funny. It also gave me a little insight to suburb life which intrigued me because I was born & raised in Harlem, NYC.

Fast forward 20yrs to present day. I'm now 31yrs old (OK OK, so I'm not an old man yet) and I find that Netflix has FINALLY released this fabulous series on Instant streaming. Understand that I had been looking for this series on DVD or other wise for some time (I don't have cable so I can't catch the reruns on TV), so I was overjoyed when I added it to my queue and started watching it a couple of days ago. It was every bit as great as I remembered it, PLUS MORE!!! NOW I was able to enjoy it because of how it cause me to reflect on my childhood. After moving from NYC to the suburbs in my early youth, I could relate to a lot of what Kevin Arnold went through and how the narrator (old Kevin Arnold) saw things through his own eyes. Let me tell you, this show made me cry when I was young because I was such a fan of the Winnie & Kevin relationship.... now this show made me cry again!! I'm only on season 3 right now, but every single episode has plucked on my heart strings and played a tune of love, laughter, loss, rebellion, reflection, failure and victory. I wasn't born and raised in the 60s, but this show makes me wish I was.

I HIGHLY recommend this series to those raised in the pre-digital age, those who witnessed the birth of the digital age, and all those poor unlucky saps who were raised in the 80s and have not had the chance to watch it yet!!! Bonus: If you're a big movie & TV buff like me, you're gonna see a LOT of familiar faces when they were young! I've already seen a young Screech & Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell, a young Larenz Tate, and a couple of actors from some Christian videos I used to see when I was young (anyone remember Mcgee & Me??)."
The Wonder,Years Of Wondering Is More Like It,"ABC has always been the purveyor of family comedies, ""The Wonder Years"" was no exception to the rule!! The difference, however, was the fact that this show was an intuitive doggerel of nostalgia which articulated an acute aspect of the YUPPIE's adolescence!!! Kevin Arnold (Ted Savage) was the perpetually befuddled kid whose predicaments were the focal point of this series, and it was his perspective that this entire show was centered around!! Daniel Stern, known for staring in the terrific movie ""Diner"", was the little voice inside Kevin that became the adult interpretation to Kevin's childhood chicanery!! The whole genre of the late sixties and early seventies was so astutely depicted on this show, right up to the fact that his mother looked just like Doris Day!! The trials and tribulations of the Arnold family were indeed a harbinger of the encroaching radicalism of American culture... Perhaps, the most impressionable character who effectuated these changing times most plausibly, was the role of Kevin's sister!! Winnie, Kevin's sort of girlfriend, was perhaps the most sensitive relationship in the series.... Looking back at it though, the whole family relationship with the older brother, the mother, the father and the sister as well as the interaction with their friends, were all delicate in their own way... The show illustrated how a comprehensive understanding of every one of the members in your family required a loving dedication to what being a family was all about!! The conception that things are suppose to be one way, and yet, they wound up being quite another, was a painstaking experience for the entire Arnold family!! This was an opportunity for adversity to manifest itself as some constructive element of household unification!! Perenially, this domestic fortitude was portrayed on ""The Wonder Years"" as an ideological staple!! Perhaps the most compelling aspect of ""The Wonder Years"" was that it pinpointed the formidable scenario of the true love cliché,(for families) and made it stick!! This was not a hokey case of true love conquering all, rather, an insight to how emotional support evoked an understanding of the bittersweet ordeals in any given domicile which are dealt with properly when everyone cares for one another!! ""The Wonder Years"" was a fabulous T.V. Show, and ,it came off as being emotionally nurturing and empathetic to the needs of the overly mortgaged YUPPIE, because, it was something for them to reminisce about!! This show was one of my favorite television shows ever!! I do not see it in syndication that much, too bad!! It must be the cable package I have, or my schedule, I would love to see reruns of ""The Wonder Years"" I think that that would be a lot of fun!!"
The Wonder,Not fun to binge watch,"Like many shows the first few seasons were better than the last two or three. There's only so much teenage angst I can take and some of it was pretty contrived. The writing on this show was too uneven, though I highly recommend the episodes on the piano lesson, the choir practice, and the math teacher, possibly some of the best writing in TV history. By the last season I wanted to throw tomatoes at the narrator. If I had to hear any more end-of-episode tripe like ""just as in the spring the flowers bloom, boys everywhere are on the cusp of manhood"" I was going to barf. From the other glowing reviews, looks like I may be in the minority here."
The Wonder,My favorite show from the 80's - probably the best show ever!,Comentario no disponible
The Wonder,Precursor to That '70s show,"I never watched That '70s Show, but in some ways The Wonder Years was the precursor. There were tender, funny, sad, tragic moments in The Wonder Years, and the finale was one for the heart string.

Could The Wonder Years be rebooted in the social media age maybe."
The Wonder,Looking Back With Wonder...,"The Wonder Years truly was a great television sitcom in its time,and for those of us who still enjoy the re runs,it is still much loved today.Kevin Arnold was the typical all American teenage boy we all felt close to,even if he was just a character that doe eyed actor Fred Savage brought to life.We followed his daily trials and tribulations,using his experiences to reflect on our own.The sitcom's true to life story lines,comedy,drama and nostalgic tone contributed to the show's success and made watching it enjoyable.The Wonder Years could make you laugh,make you cry,make you remember what it was like to be 12 years old,and in love,as we fondly watched the relationship between Kevin and his dream girl Winnie Cooper,blossom,overcoming all the obstacles along the way.The closing dialogue of this magical sitcom will forever be remembered: Growing up happens in a heartbeat.One day you're in diapers,the next you're gone.But the memories of childhood stay with you for the long haul.I have fond memories of the Wonder Years,and enjoy watching the re runs.Hopefully the complications will be overcome in the near future,and the magic of this memorable sitcom can be re lived on DVD."
The Wonder,Plots were real,"Most of the plots of the show actually happened to the target audience of the time -30 somethings. That's what made this show great. For me it was school walk out to protest the Viet Nam war. I remember thinking when I first watched that episode, did the writers go to Oak Crest Jr. High in Encinitas with me in 1969? Because that's exactly the way it happened. I think of that episode daily when I drop my son off at the same school. I see that courtyard where we all walked out to, and remember the strife of the teachers talking, should we, or shouldn't we allow this to happen, and just like the show, the one or two teachers that joined in, were the ones we thought were cool."
The Wonder,Ending up where it all first began,Comentario no disponible
The Wonder,The perfect show,"This is perhaps one of the best TV shows ever written. The writing is really strong with a mixture of subtle comedy, drama and romance. I think what makes this show so good is the very believable story lines. People can relate to almost every episode having experienced similar things in real life. But perhaps the defining factor is the casting. It's perfect. Every recurring character is ideally cast. Even the guest actors such as Mr. Collins, the match teacher, Cutlip, the gym teacher, etc. are fantastic in their roles. The comedy is not over the top and the drama is not melodramatic. The icing on the cake is the music. Fantastic selections of 60's/70's tunes help to make the show."
The Wonder,I'll get by with a little help from The Wonder Years,"The Wonder Years brings back nostalgia of an era which I did not live. Few people have lives as perfect and ordinary as Kevin Arnold: the nerdy best friend, the gorgeous girl-next-door, the hippie sister, the obnoxious brother. Though this is a television family, with all it's stereotypes in place, The Wonder Years perfectly encapsulates both the changing times of the late 60's/early 70's, and the painful awkwardness of adolescence.

This show will likely never be released on DVD. And if it is, it will be without the original music (liscensing for the huge amount of popular music would be astronomically expensive). This is unfortunate, because The Wonder Years is one of the best TV shows ever to be put on television. If you have a chance to, watch it!"
The Wonder,The Best Of Television,"I watched The Wonder Years every Tuesday night when I was in Jr. High and I don't think I ever missed an episode. That was 20 years ago and I still watch it today with my 9 year old son. The setting is so ""Everytown USA"" in that it brings back memories of growing up in suburbia for probably everyone who watches. The Arnold family is like every other family, wonderful and loving and dysfunctional all at the same time. Norma and Jack remind me of my parents. The loving mom that you adore yet are a little embarrassed to be seen with and the stern, bread winning dad who isn't home very often and when he is he's reading the paper/watching t.v., or telling you to cut the grass. And of course the big brother who you fight with constantly but look up to at the same time. And the free-spirited older sis, whose aimless wandering we can all identify with. The clothes, the music, the bicycles with banana seats and the relationships and life lessons all ring true to those who have grown up and remember our own ""wonder years"". And for the young kids watching it today, as it did for me when I first watched, it teaches important lessons about growing up and how to enjoy it while it lasts! There is nothing else like it, it's simply the best!"
The Wonder,If you've seen the show then I don't even need to tell you.,"(cue the movie trailer voice guy>) In a world where Breaking Bad and The Wire (both incredible shows) both score 9.4 and The Wonder Years only scores 8.2. (end the movie trailer voice guy)...Seriously though...this is a travesty. I honestly couldn't believe that The Wonder Years didn't score higher. Granted that this is a deeply personal show for me...but judging from the other reviews, it seems to be a deeply personal show for a lot of people. What is amazing about The Wonder Years is its ability to relate cross generations. I'm not going to talk specifically about any one episode because there are too many and no one here wants to read about my life story, but bear with me. I was born in 1980...so when I started watching The Wonder Years I was 8 and it ended when I was 13.....pretty much my formative years as a child. Watching the show during this time even as a child it was important to me. As a child, I could relate to Kevin or at least some of the other characters on a level where the understanding to me had everything to do with his experiences as a child and not a whole lot for the generation in which he lived his life. It worked for my parents because the show both created nostalgia to the time period in which they grew up as well and holding nostalgic memories of experiences that they may have had in common with the characters. Watching this show later in life only further showed me how great a show this truly was. Viewing this show 20+ years later you are able to see the show in a completely different light. While I'm not able to share in the nostalgia of the time period...as my parents...I am able to better relate to teenage Kevin....and his parents, grandparents, and dare I even say his jackass of a brother Wayne. If I wrote this review at another time I might be able to write a better one, but I am writing this on pure emotion and I can honestly tell you that this was one of the best shows ever made for television. The creators and the writers knew exactly what they were doing and it showed. Perhaps the Wonder Years was a little too far ahead of its time...or maybe America is all the stupider. I just feel bad for the kids of today that have no clue of this show. It is a damn shame that they won't either until licensing fees are worked out and and they can actually get this show on DVD. They need to do it right though. They can't leave out or replace the music because in blended in and complimented the show to a point that to leave it out would be to savagely diminish the quality....(sigh) Until then I'll have to rely on my bootleg copies and keep reminding the world that The Wonder Years even existed in the first place."
The Wonder,There's no easy way to say this... I grew up in the suburbs.,"I have to admit that I love Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold. The cast included Dan Lauria and Alley Mills playing his sixties' parents, the Arnolds. Then there were his siblings, a sister played by Olivia D'Abo and a big bully brother played by Jason Hervey. Kevin was the youngest and we hear his thoughts from Daniel Stern's narration. The other cast members included Danica McKellar as his love interest Winnie and a geeky friend whose name escapes me at the moment. The show is going to be aired late on the I network in a couple of weeks. I have to admit that I liked it in the beginning but it wore off in time. It was different because there was no laugh track or audience. Most family oriented comedies of the 1980s had audiences and laughter. This show was different and it was also set in the 1960s with an unknown suburb as location. The creators, Neal Marlens and Carol Black, who created Growing Pains went on to create The Wonder Years. The writing was uneven at times but solid as the acting."
The Wonder,"A great show, full of many classic moments","""The Wonder Years,"" even though the show was a period piece, it still seems like the events it portrayed weren't that long ago and still have some relevance today. I was born in 1985, so I wasn't alive when Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) came of age during the turbulent 1960s and 1970s in the United States, as was portrayed in the show and whose thoughts were narrated by Daniel Stern. He was one of the most likable television characters of my formative years. The life lessons, the romance, the conflicts with friends and family alike, and the pains of adolescence and growing up still resonate nearly two decades later after this show's successful run on television with today's audiences. Why this show hasn't gotten a DVD treatment, I'll never know. I just know that for several years this was truly one of the best shows in the history of American television.

The Wonder,Good But Should Have Been Extended,"This series is one of the more memorable ones if you're a 90s kid. I felt like the series was really interesting and different compared to other tv shows of it's time.

American Dreams on NBC actually had similar run- and did quite well. But that would have been analogous to this one. American Dreams was fun to since it had a more musical element to it.

I felt like the timeline for Wonder Years, even as a kid, was never fully explained well.

He goes to junior high in 1968 and graduates high school a few years later? All of the characters were developed fully instead of the middle brother- I definitely would have loved to see more about his back story.

For me, the series just suffered alittle bit on ending alittle bit too soon. But I felt like later programs with a similar style and the My Girl Movie series did well."
The Wonder,A rarity amongst TV sitcoms,"This show has an engaging cast with stories set in the 1960s that involved down-to-earth, realistic plots. That's the real wonder of THE WONDER YEARS. It is far superior to most sitcoms because it isn't really a sitcom -- in other words it isn't based on silly situations and lame-brained characters.

The show is about growing up and the discovery of human nature. The writing has a depth unlike that of most TV shows. The humor is genuine, not based on typical TV contrived situations and shallow clowning. This is destined to be one of the classics of TV series."
The Wonder,I highly recommend this program,"Excellent stories from time of adolescence of Kevin. In addition very good music which suit perfectly with different story lines. It's a very nostalgic series, but to me in not bad meaning. I don't know any other similar series maybe except from ""Freaks and Geeks"" which also rate high. I think that's very touching and inspired me to think about past and about important decisions, that everybody must sometimes make. It's obvious that real life is not so funny but rather ordinary and for more or less boring, but I think that when we chose some best moments of our lives, it would also be interesting. I want more so high-quality series about past, it could be also useful to get know, how the life was like."

Yu-Gi-Oh!,A good story butchered by 4Kids Censorship,"Bear with me on this first, okay? I think Yugiô, or Yu-Gi-Oh, is great. It's fun to watch. The story can be engaging at times, and even the voices of the dub can be enjoyable from time to time as well...

...but then in comes snake in the grass 4Kids. It thwarts the nature and goals of the series' baddies and censures countless scenes out of the original version. It is true that you can expect nothing less from a broadcast for kids, but these guys have taken the renewal of this series to unpleasant heights. Where in Japan you saw once-up antagonists get drunk in a bar, enticing clothing, semi-revealed body parts, several cases of nudity, wicked tongue action from... you know who if you are a fan, and some mild harsh language, 4Kids removes scenes, dresses the 'Black Magician Girl' up in a dumb pair of pink trunks, digitally embellishes the 'horrors of combat', dumbs down some dialogue, digitally removes some female characters' cleavages and simply makes the entire experience of watching this a lot more bland.

I dare any of you to watch the very first dubbed episode, and then watch a dubbed episode from season two and three and you see how 4Kids struggled with this show. Where they started out using phrases like 'super awesome rare' and with a character representation about as shallow as those in Toddler oriented Nick Toons, they 'got their game on' in order to show a slightly more grown up struggle along the way. It is commendable that 4Kids have kept it from becoming a total farce, but that brings one to the real problem.

It is sometimes hard to confide in a series like Yu-gi-oh, because almost every single conflict from beginning to end plays out in a children's card game. Subliminal messages throughout the series, or at least the dub, entitle the gamer's philosophy, that is to say the 'Heart of the Cards'. Of course, if they were just playing a friendly game all the time, this premise and the continuous and sometimes absolutely nauseating friendship skits would all be meaningless. But then, after having wagered one's soul over a dozen time in perilous 'shadow games', these guys do need a philosophy to survive the onslaught of all these card games.

Many people already start to get me wrong here. I like this show, even the dub, but where it really sets off is in the last two seasons, where characters really start developing, and the world really starts turning. Where the still ever-present pep talks and friendship speeches blot out the ever-mounting stakes in the dub, the original version can be very touching at times, and some duels in this late stage of the show do seem very meaningful (My favorites: Both duels between Mou hitori no (Yami) Yugi vs. Raferu (Raphael)). And that is why I think it has the potential to be this good; because while being fully aware that good guy and bad guy are resolving their disputes by playing a children's card game, one can forget that they are actually playing a children's card game at times.

Of course, the card games are just the means to every end and the story does not necessarily revolve around the duels per se. The storyline of the ancient Pharaoh sealing himself and his memory away in order to stop (at first rather generic) evil, as well as some of the Egyptian themes within the series are quite engaging and interesting, although it must be admitted that after all the time that this mystery remains sealed (the first four seasons, in fact), its resolution can be really underwhelming. Also undeniable; the fourth season, where the cast takes on an ancient free mason like organization called Damu (Doom in the dub, I think) is one of the, if not the best and most introspective story arcs. It is a shame that it destroys the pace, and is the main reason why the conclusion is slightly underwhelming and detached.

Do yourself a favor. If you go and watch this series, watch the Japanese version. The dub is okay (I give it a 5 thumbs up out of 10), but the Japanese version is great (9 kawaiis out of 10). Plus, the Japanese soundtrack is much more better."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,The best Manga series there is!!,"I don't know why so many people doesn't like this show, it's got everything you can wish from a good cartoon show. The excitement, humor and the fight against good and evil. And when they are taking most of the story from agent Egypt It's get more and more exited.

I had never enjoyed a Manga series this much, except from Sailor Moon. But this series is the best when it comes down from it's category. But it's too bad that the cards you can buy from the series is to expensive, but that doesn't stop me. I got almost a hundred, and more is going to be.

Yu-Gi-Oh is the best cartoon show I had ever seen and the movie is so god that I can watch it over and over again. THIS IS ABSOLUTE GREAT!!!"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Surprisingly Complex Characters/Plot,"When my brother started watching this show and I heard bits of it in the background I thought it sounded like the stupidest thing ever--I heard bits of dialogue along the lines of ""Oh, yeah! Well I attack with my dark magician!"" or ""Now I shall harness the power of all millennium items and rule the world!"" or ""Ha ha, with the power of our friendship we will defeat you!"" However, after I had been forced to actually watch several episodes and began to actually follow the plot and character development, I discovered to my surprise that this show, while it is basically just a marketing ploy to sell trading cards, is actually a complex and fascinating story with well-developed and multi-dimensional characters and relationships.

Now, granted, you have to have certain tolerances to enjoy this show: you have to accept the world in which the characters live, in which for some reason everything seems to ride on this certain card game, Duel Monsters, and in which there exist ancient items with various spirits trapped inside them. If you're inclined to dismiss the premises of the plot as stupid, then this show is not for you. Secondly, you have to tolerate the fact that much of the show consists of duels, in which the characters themselves compete in the card game that the show is designed to market. It helps if you're a 6 to 12-year-old boy (or anyone else, I suppose) and are actually into playing the card game yourself. Or, like me, you can simply realize that the game actually is quite interesting and complex, and in the show is used to advance the plot and character development, and just accept it. Finally, you have to tolerate a certain amount of sappiness--the main characters do often take the time to go on and on about the importance of friendship and courage and standing up for yourself, etc etc...however, I personally find this somewhat refreshing after watching my brother play countless video games where the main message seemed to be Kill Anything in Your Path if It Will Give You Energy Points or some such advantage. And the character relationships are complex enough that these speeches, when they occur, are actually meaningful and sometimes (at least to me!) quite touching.

The point is, don't dismiss this show. The animation is crisp and nuanced (except for occasionally when they decide for some reason to switch to exaggerated, cartoon-like animation, particularly with Joey--those moments are probably my least favorite aspect of the show!), and the characters are real, touching, and very entertaining. Suspend your cynicism and just let yourself enjoy the show--it's actually quite worth it!!"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Even With The Nostalgia Goggles Off, It's Still Entertaining","The year was 1999. The 90s were making their final rounds in television, spewing out franchise after franchise to weather the storm of the 2000s. But out of all the shows created in these times, only two have withstood the test of time: Pokemon, and Yu-Gi-Oh.

But why was Yu-Gi-Oh so successful? I mean, it was just a card game, right? There were plenty of other franchises that existed to sell toys: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Pokemon, Star Wars (you know, the prequels), etc. So what made Yu-Gi-Oh any different? Because, dear friend, while other shows' merchandise remained simple merchandise, Yu-Gi-Oh took a Japanese card game and turned it into A BATTLE OF GOD-LIKE ENTITIES, HERE TO RECLAIM THE WORLD THEY RULED SO LONG AGO.

Seriously, if you knew the card game, then you knew NOTHING about the show. It managed to tie this simple game to Egyptian rituals, malevolent spirits, dark magic, action, peril, souls being bound to items of immeasurable power... Does this bone-chilling stuff sound ANYTHING like a children's card game to you?

That's not to say that the show is dark; most of the time it's quite upbeat and focuses on the card game. But when the dark powers appear before us, you can FEEL the grandiose nature of their presence OOZING out of the screen. You can feel the fact that there are greater forces at work at all times; always lurking in the shadows, always calculating their next move, and the only ones that stand between us and their demented plans are Yugi Moto and company.

Now, I know a lot of people like to complain about how 4Kids took out a lot of the violence, the nudity, the use of guns in certain scenes, and... Honestly, I'm glad they did. This show doesn't NEED violence; it doesn't need a lot of the more adult content that the Japanese include in their kids shows. By taking a lot of those elements out, they made the show more about what it SHOULD focus on: the mysticism and the card game. Putting in guns, violence and other ""questionable"" content only serves to bring the show closer to reality, the exact opposite of magic. Yes, the first few episodes are pretty dumbed down and the first arc holds little basis in the actual rules of the game. But once it got past that stage, it turned into a really fun, really enjoyable experience, with the exception of some painfully obvious censorship here and there.

So if you love magic, mystery, secrets, dark realms of evil power, and 2D animation that still holds up today, check out this incredible show. It is AWESOME, man!"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,I actually like it.,"Long before Little Kurbioh started making his videos I watched the original series of Yugioh and it's spin off Yugioh Gx. Even though I'm fully aware that it's just an excuse to sell cards of a trading card game I actually think the series has a lot of charm to it. The villains are all either scary or just plain funny, the duels can sometimes be exciting, and Yugioh is the only show I can think of that actually has great filler. In fact some of my favorite seasons of the show (The Noah Virtual World saga and the Waking the Dragons arc) While the dub by 4kids is littered with horrible voice acting, lame jokes, and plenty of cringe worthy moments the original Japanese sub had amazing opening and closing credits and adds a lot of substance to the story."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Really great but not perfect. I will review every arc without spoilers under here,"After a lot I finally watched it all. First of all, watch the original not censored version, since half of it was cut. Second of all, Duke and Serenity are some of the most dull and bland characters ever, you even forget they exist after a while.

People who played the Nightmare troubadour game will love this anime, since it follows exactly the same story. In my opinion this is the best yu gi oh when it comes to timeless monsters and characters designs. (I do recommend to watch half of Yu gi oh season 0 if anyone wants to actually see how yugi and friends met)

Ep: 1-49 The characters are well presented. There's the most iconic ones: yugi,tea,joey,seto,mokuba,bakura,marik,ishizu,pegasus,mai. This arc is one of the worst ones, rules do not exist and some cards don't either so I wouldn't take it seriously at all. 5/10

Ep: 50-97 This is definitely the best arc. The duels start to have actual rules and 4000lp but some cards are still too op unlike real cards, like joey dice cards. The story begins, rare hunters, Egyptian gods, and the millennium items appear. 9/10

Ep: 98-121 The submarine arc is pretty good since it explains kaiba real story. Doesn't contribute to the story but I would watch it. 8/10

Ep: 122-144 The previous story continues. 9/10

Ep: 145-184 This is the most boring arc of the series. I never cared for Atlantic theme and another forgettable enemie. The Egyptian gods disappear until the end which is lame. I would just skip this. 4/10

Ep: 185-198 Just a tournament, it's an ok arc. 6/10

Ep: 199-224 This is definitely the 2nd best arc. The actual Evil of the anime finally reappears (I thought they forgot about him) and it's not Marik. It explains the actual past of the pharaoh and the origin of his enemie, the 7 millennium items that are never taken in consideration until now and how thanks to them duel monsters was born, the origin of Seto's past and his dragon, dark magician and dark magician girl who were actually reincarnations of important figures in the characters lives. 8/10."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Plain storyline with poor execution - didnt age well but definitely something nostalgic for me,"Unrealistic gameplay and nothing like their card games. Simple plotting but terrible execution - the flow was awful. Ridiculous scenes and sudden changes on characterisation, poor motives on certain characters. Same formula used as in all of the duel - the power of writing to make it convenient for the main characters to get the card they expected right on time lol. Awful voice casting especially pegasus sounds like a white washed robot. Just overexaggerated performances/execution overall.

P. S. Yugioh have changed a lot drastically over the past. It is much more competitive and relevant compared this terrible adaption.

Probably the cheesiet anime that i ever revisited. Used to watch it like a lot on tv when i was kid. Even the remastered version cant safe this season. The intro commentary was very memorable and both the intro & outro song was very nostalgic for me. Some unnecessary characters and unnecessary dramas. The characters design were considerably okay since it was an old & classic anime (Big eyes and big head was pretty common back in those days lol).

Now that i rewatched it i dont think that i will ever watch it again in future & definitely not something the newer generation would watch this. This doesnt age well."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"One of the best Animés Of All Time, Way Better Than Dinosaur King","If you Get Pokemon and Magic the Gathering and Combine them you Get Yu-Gi-Oh!

I know, right? Yu-Gi-Oh! is still one of the best Animes ever made, Yu-Gi-Oh! hypnotized an entire generation with its stylized animation, surreal humor, and dramatic turns.

But I don't know why so many people doesn't like this show

Yu-Gi-Oh was One of My Favorite Animé series Next to Pokemon and Digimon

I used to watch ""Yu Gi Oh"" for the 1st time when I was 11 or 12

it's a good show but not bad as Dinosaur King, Duel Masters (a Copy of Yu- Gi-Oh) and Battle B-Daman But it was awesome it has manga books, cards, video games, videos, DVDs and Movies

The Animation was great and the Voice Acting was Awesome

My Favorite Characters from this Series are Yugi and Kaiba

Season 1 is where the yu gi oh story begins It has a Few Memorable Duels

Season 2 Was Great But Not the best of the series but Joey was a bit annoying but Marik was a Pretty Cool Villain and the Egyptian God Cards was Awesome not even ash could face those Egyptian God monsters

Season 3 was part 2 of the Battle City Arc The VR World story arc was not that bad using any monster card as a deck master was not that bad but Noah was a little bit annoying than Mai a lot of People really Hated the Virual World Arc but i think its Okay but the Abridged Version of the Virtual World Arc was a Little Offensive as the Abriged version of the Battle City Arc

The Final Face-off Parts 1,2,3,4&5 is Epic the Waking the Dragons arc was good The Legendary Dragons are Awesome and Dartz was a Great and Solid Villain (Still better than Team Rocket from Pokemon and Super Buu from DBZ) and Dartz's Motercycle Henchmen are Awesome and the worst part about season 4 was Mai she was very annoying since season 2 i hate it when Mai calls joey names Season 5 was the Final Season of the Original Yu Gi Oh But I never Watched the 5th Season of Yu-Gi-Oh! The Only Season 5 Episodes i've Watched are the Last 4 Episodes the Final Episode was Great but the yu-gi-oh duels are pretty long because it takes 6 Episodes or 5 episodes or 4 episodes or 3 episodes like the dragon ball z battles The Sound Effects from American Cartoons are A Bit Useless and it's a Bit Like Watching an Episode Of Pokemon or Watching an Episode of the Funimation Version of Dragon Ball Z The Dialogues from the 4Kids dub of Yu-Gi-Oh! are a Bit Corny at Times (Well like Most 4Kids Dubbed Animes)

but Saddly when they made the gx series and the 5ds series and the Zexal series, It would just never be the same. GX is not the best series yet No Yamis, No Marik (Make way for Pegasus and the paradox brothers), Alexis was one of the most annoying female characters ever (even worse than Mai), No Bakura, No Musics from the Original (the Rock Musics from GX is the Only Plus point in this spin off) They Got Rid of Yugi and Kaiba and Joey and the other yu gi oh characters from the original yu gi oh in 5ds But i never watch 5ds because Card Games on Motorbikes is a Stupid Idea how come 5ds has the highest rating than the original?

I heard that A Few People Really Hate Zexal As for Arc-V, I Never Watched Them Yu-Gi-Oh the Movie was not Bad but it's a Must See for any Yu Gi Oh Fans The Duels Are Epic, the animation was great and the All-New Blue Eyes Shining Dragon was awesome!!!! and I'm a bit shocked at the negative reviews and the low ratings for this movie Well Still Better than Son of the Mask Yu-Gi-Oh the Abridged Series and the rest of littlekuriboh's videos are so Funny Martin Billany aka LittleKuriboh has a fantastic voice talent, great editing, and he perfectly represents the characters with hilarious lines and Pop-Cultral references. But if you like this show or not, you will love Martin Billany's successful Parody i wish littlekuriboh will win the awards Bottom Line i Really Enjoyed Yu-Gi-Oh But it has a Few Flaws But its Still Awesome And Its Way Better than Phineas and Ferb, way better than Dinosaur King and Way Better than Duel Masters I Have the Cards and the DVDs and the Toys and the video games

I only liked the original Yu-Gi-Oh, but none of the Yu-Gi-Oh spin offs/sequels such as GX and 5Ds and Zexal. I found the following Yu-Gi-Oh spin offs/sequels to be Stupid Because it won't be the same as the original. I give the Original Yu-Gi-Oh 9/10 stars and all of the following Yu-Gi-Oh spin offs/sequels such as GX and 5Ds and Zexal 2/10 stars. Sorry GX fans and 5Ds fans the Original Yu-Gi-Oh is the best of the Yu-Gi-Oh Series

Jakie's Uncle: One More Thing To all Yu-Gi-Oh! Haters out There Don't Call Yu-Gi-Oh! a Pokemon Copy nor a Commercial"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,One of the better Japanese cartoon monster animes,"After Digimon and Pokemon I was wondering what other anime would come into American culture. Then there was Yu-Gi-Oh. There's a lot of interesting things in there, including battles between good and evil, Ancient Egypt, creatures that would make Ray Harryhausen proud (some of which can be a little disturbing), and a good cast of characters (some of whom you can relate to in real life). I know some online people who love this show and while I'm not a big, huge fan, I thought it was entertaining. I never collected the cards (I'm not big on card games, though I did collect some of the Decipher Star Wars CCG line) and I'd never even heard of Yu-Gi-Oh until I watched the show in the early 2000s. I haven't seen so much creature action since the Harryhausen films, or should I say Digimon and Pokemon?"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,An Overwhelmingly Confusing and Repetitive Anime Experience,"Yu-Gi-Oh!, the long-running anime series, is a confusing and repetitive show that fails to deliver a compelling viewing experience. With its convoluted plotlines, repetitive structure, and shallow character development, this series struggles to captivate audiences beyond its dedicated fanbase.

One of the major issues with Yu-Gi-Oh! Is its overly convoluted and confusing plotlines. The narrative is filled with intricate card game rules, complex story arcs, and an abundance of characters, making it difficult for newcomers to follow and understand. The constant introduction of new card mechanics and convoluted strategies often overwhelms the viewer, resulting in a disjointed and hard-to-follow storyline. The lack of clarity and coherent storytelling hinders the show's ability to engage and immerse the audience.

Furthermore, Yu-Gi-Oh! Falls into the trap of repetitive storytelling. Most episodes follow a formulaic structure, with the protagonist engaging in card battles and relying on predictable strategies to secure victory. The repetitive nature of the series leads to a sense of predictability and monotony, diminishing the excitement and tension that card duels should evoke. The lack of variety in the storytelling prevents the series from evolving and exploring new narrative possibilities, making each episode feel like a rehash of the previous ones.

The character development in Yu-Gi-Oh! Is shallow and lacks nuance. The protagonists and their opponents are often one-dimensional and defined solely by their card dueling skills. The supporting cast is relegated to background roles and rarely receive meaningful development or exploration. The lack of well-rounded and relatable characters hampers the viewer's ability to emotionally invest in their journeys, resulting in a lack of empathy or connection.

Another significant drawback of Yu-Gi-Oh! Is its heavy reliance on product placement and merchandising. The series often feels like a vehicle for selling trading card games and related merchandise rather than a compelling storytelling experience. The constant emphasis on acquiring new cards and showcasing their features detracts from the overall narrative and creates a sense of commercialization that feels off-putting.

The animation and visual quality of Yu-Gi-Oh! Vary throughout the series. While there are some visually impressive moments during card battles, the overall animation can be inconsistent and lacks the fluidity and detail found in other contemporary anime. The art style, while distinctive, may not appeal to everyone, and the character designs can feel dated compared to more modern anime offerings.

In conclusion, Yu-Gi-Oh! Is an overwhelmingly confusing and repetitive anime series that struggles to engage a broader audience. The convoluted plotlines, repetitive structure, shallow character development, and heavy commercialization hinder the series' ability to provide a compelling and immersive viewing experience. While it may still hold nostalgic value for long-time fans, newcomers seeking a more coherent and sophisticated storytelling experience would be better off exploring other anime options that offer more depth and narrative coherence."

Yu-Gi-Oh!,I'm a huge fan!,"OK, I'll admit it...I am a sucker for the ""30 min. commercials"". I have been ever since I was a kid back in the, uh, 80's. I would go out and buy all the brand-new cool Transformers featured in the cartoon. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?...I was there. I am every toy manufacturers' ... dream. Yu-Gi-Oh is the continuation of my bizarre fascination with cartoons.

What's so great about this cartoon. Honestly, I can't say what it is I like. OK, I lied. I absolutely love the duels! I'm not a huge Anime fan, so that really does nothing for me. The constant babbling about ""friendship"" and ""love"" I can certainly do without. Not that those are bad things, and it's good that kids are taught these values while being brainwashed into buying the game, but it can be *awfully* sugary-sweet, especially when you're, um, <mumble> twenty-eight </mumble>. But I really enjoy the duels and it makes me want to go out and buy the cards and play with other people. Unfortunately, I have no friends, and my wife doesn't have any interest in dueling me. Fortunately, there's Game Boy Advance. I was given Dark Duel Stories for Christmas and recently bought Eternal Duelist Soul...both great games, though EDS is definitely closer to the original game than DDS. The point being, this tv show is really nothing more than an avenue for advertising their games...and I love it!

Now, what I'd like to see is how well Yugi fairs against someone who has some really nasty cards in their deck....how would he handle having Raigeki and Dark Hole being smacked down on his Dark Magician and Summoned Skull????"

Yu-Gi-Oh!,the card game,So after the horrible season 0 we finally get to the real yu-gi-oh anime then Unlike season 0 this is animated well enough that I liked this anime but I already know that it was made on purpose for advertising of the cards because it wasn't the same as it issuccess with Pokémon Digimon Beyblade I say that the duels are beautiful Yugi Muto is a very well made character the problem is that he really does very little In this anime because all the duels are always done by the pharaohs however there are three things that I don't understand they make this much more enjoyableseries first I don't like the argument between Joey and Cristian for me these things are really unbearable when they always argue second I don't like Seto Kaiba because I don't like his character and throughout the series he never believes in everything what happens And this makes mereally very angry in the way he behaves for me he was the worst character in this series and I always respect someone if you like him third the only Saga that I didn't like was the one that organized Seto Kaiba or to open the his amusement park the crowdduardo deall useless that doesn't really serve anything to the anime but above all I didn't like the villain of this Saga or Sigfricon or the usual ambiguous character or those male characters who look like females but above all who talks about that annoying German accent for me it was theworst villain of the anime and then the bad thing about that Saga that they never show cards of the Challengers didn't even show the only ones they show are the important people of this Saga but there are only six And if someone likes the cards Give a 'look at this anime to concludevote 7.
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"Surprisingly still good for older, grown up viewers","I was in middle school when Yu-Gi-Oh first appeared on US TV and unfortunately only watched about 3/4 of Battle City tournament (not due to lack of interest but because of strict parents). Well, 15 years later and in my late 20's, I just randomly thought about this anime and decided to finish watching it, mainly out of curiosity on how it all ends for Yugi and his friends. To my surprise, I enjoyed watching it more so as an adult than when I was a preteen. I watched the 4Kids version due to nostalgia and familiarity but despite all the backlash and criticism it appears to receive from viewers who prefer the Japanese original, I still think the dub is satisfactory, esp. the last few episodes when...um...anyway, I became so attached to the characters I didn't want it to end :( Most of all, I love the card game and cannot stop playing Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links on my smartphone!"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Japanese Version worth checking out,"First of all the whole Yugioh Story is Epic, however I later realised after watching the German and English Version, that it's not the whole Story. The Japanese Version of Yugioh is more brutal, dark and dramatic in its whole concept. Characters and cards are different of course and most important some dialogues are total different.

For me a good storyline is important but most importantly is the Music, although the western Version has also beautifully composed Music, the Japanese is more touching and even romantic at times.

In usual anime's are in japanese and they are best suited to watch in subs, rather dubbed.."

Yu-Gi-Oh!,Could have been the best,"I cried during the final episode of this series, it really touched me to think that it was all over.

a few people i used to know made fun of me for liking this series, well they never bothered watching did they or even picking up a copy of the manga.

I must admit i'm seriously disappointed with what 4kids turned this show into, it's just another shining example that they should leave animes undubbed and subtitled, i know Japanese voices can seem to some to be irritating but they have more emphasis and no one makes them say stupid phrases like they do in the English versions, it dumbs down the whole experience."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,"You go, Yu-Gi-Oh! Go away, that is.","(r#97)

There is one good thing about this poor man's Pokémon (make of that what you will): the opening theme. It has to be the coolest theme music of any sloppily dubbed Japanese made-for-the-consumers-oops-I-mean-the-young-fans anime TV show. Unfortunately there was need to add some sort of show after the opening theme. And they just couldn't come up with something more interesting than people arguing loudly about whose cards are better than the others' cards. Freud would have a field day, unfortunately I can't imagine why any kids would want to sit through a show where dialogue written by a thousand monkeys in five minutes takes up 98% of the running time.

""My Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom will take your measly Pyramid Diamond Animal in a single strike! Can't you see that you have no chance of winning this battle, you fool?! HAHAHAHHAHHAHA!""

""Oh yeah? Well watch this! I am about to use my Destruction Force Delta Times Pie Card which eradicates every single one of your Power Munchers and renders your Uber-Fantastical Doomsday Creature of Ultimate Doom's Destroy Beyond all Significance Attack useless! I bet you didn't see that one coming!""

Seriously, that's all they ever do in this show, talk. Whereas in another crappy kids' show I used to watch, namely the commercial phenomenon Pokémon (every soccer mum's pet peeve), at least the monsters had the courtesy to duke it out every once in a while, ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" is just, in the quiet words of Roger Ebert's A Clockwork Orange review, ""plain talky and boring"". Not to mention long-winded (I realize I'm being hypocritical here considering the sentence I just wrote).

This show goes on forever. I don't know if there's any plot, and the static monsters have none of the character of Pokémon. Even when not compared to my fave cartoon as a kid, this show sucks. It's unintentionally funny, but not funny enough to be worth seeing. Bye bye, sleep tight, dream wet dreams."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Far superior to most,"Yu-Gi-Oh! can be confusing to those with slower mind-speeds. The duels like all plot devises, are used to progress the plot and even develop the characters, and in an effort to do so, may annoy, frustrate, or even confuse some members of the audience unfamiliar with the game strategy and cards(effects). However, the these duels are essentially not difficult to follow.

The overall plot of the series is complex and very entertaining. Of the main characters, and aside from Yami Yugi, the villains are often the most compelling. The most interesting, and charismatic of these ""villainous"" characters being Seto Kaiba(thanks to the paragon voice-work of Eric Stuart), with Ryu Bakura, Maximillion Pegasus, and Marik Ishtar following close behind.

This series, unlike many others, requires the audience to possess functioning memories in order to recall the mythology. The plot is intriguing for those who enjoy mysteries and suspense(although watching YU-GI-OH! one need never fear the hero will be anything other than victorious).

Yu-Gi-Oh! is an excellent choice for children in order to instill morals and values; most importantly honor, courage, loyalty, and confidence in oneself.

Grade: A"
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Nostalgic and I love it!,"""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" is about a boy named Yugi, who gets the mysterious millennium puzzle as a present from his grandfather. In this is the soul of the pharaoh Yami Yugi, into which Yugi turns from now on when he plays the card game ""Duel Monsters"". Yugi and his friends Joey, Tea and Tristan have to go through many adventures throughout the series in which Yugi faces off against the forces of evil.

Probably due in large part to nostalgia, but I love Yu-Gi-Oh!

The thrill of when Yugi is about to lose a match and somehow still manages to defeat his opponent is still the same today as it was then.

Sadly the franchise was rode to death for the profit, after this series."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,Fun to watch despite the heavy censorship,"This show clearly had a lot of censorship and missing episodes (For starters, this series seems to be a sequel, hence why we never have a proper introduction of the main cast) Despite that, I enjoyed watched this. It is a fun series, and the card game is fun too.

I am not familiar with the sequels, but the ""original"" Yugioh anime (Well, the second one actually) was a highly entertaining series.

The dub shown in my country actually had a great cast with excellent voices. (Tristan was voiced by the same actor that dubbed Fry from Futurama!) I guess that factor might have contributed to my enjoyment."
Yu-Gi-Oh!,You can't help but give it a 10!,This anime has a legacy of its own. It became part a generation's childhood with the series and with the deck cards and video games. It's a 10 for a legendary anime.

Ultras,"A good film, if an entirely predictable one","A good film, if an entirely predictable one.

'Ultras' portrays the world of Italian football ultras, a thing that has always intrigued me given I follow Serie A; though admittedly I have little actual knowledge about supporter culture in Italy. Based on what I do know, I like how the film is put together. It's shot very nicely.

The acting is better than average, though Aniello Arena is the clear standout. I really enjoyed his performance as Sandro. The other cast members are all fine in their respective roles.

The premise is largely fun to watch, though from the middle of the second act the film does lose its momentum. It regains some of it for the final major event, though it stills affects my feelings towards this. The cinematography is decent, also.

Ultras,Good movie,"A good storyline, with good acting It is an entertaining movie However i would more liked to see more events that reflect the reality and the stadium. They didn't even show the satdium"
Ultras,"Good story, weird ending",Comentario no disponible
Ultras,Understand now,"After watching the movie, it makes me understand why government banned underground society. No matter what goal of those societies are, it's dangerous for community and teenagers inside. Basically just brainwash folks and ppl get manipulated. The movie is good and delivered the serious message but not in a serious way."
Ultras,Whole movie in the trailer,"After the trailer you would of liked to imagined a full plot twist story. But no😂. It's literally the longer version of the trailer. The ending is so predictable and so... Clichéd. But I gave 6 for the producer and actors, great job. Soundtrack very good too. It's a pretty good movie if you want to see it just as a movie, without further involvement comparing with the real ultras life. But if you do...come on, in this movie the relationship football-ultras doesn't exist. No in stadium footage, no words about football as a sport, which gives the movie the biggest minus. We all know Italy it's full of passion for Calcio, good thing they washed their hands at the beginning of the movie saying that no real-life ultras took place in the movie production. And as I'm writing I'm thinking... How clichéd is this too... Napoli. If it was England it would of been Millwall, France - Marseille, you got my point.

But still, as a movie, it's totally ok. Worth the try."

Ultras,Great drawn of ultra mentality,"One of the best films of sub-genre of ultra/ hooliganism world. With 'Ultrá' italian film of the 90s and the english 'The Firm' Very credible cast, and, very well documented what a ultra really is."
Ultras,Gian Luca Viacchi is an Ultra,"After watching series like Gomorrah, Suburra, Romazzo Criminale and ZeroZeroZero, I have decided to give a try to the movie Ultras. First, the script itself it's weak, inconsistent and pretty simple. Uncommon because usually Itialian products from Amazon or Netflix are pretty great. Second, most of the acting is amateurish. I didn't feel anything for the characters. Last, the ending is a joke, pretty unrealistic. So, overall just an OK drama to watch if you do not have anything else on the list. A lot of better options on Netflix."
Ultras,Really enjoyed the movie.,"The story and acting was very good and realy liked the movie. It's not a documentary about hooligans and football but more about the life of a middle aged member of Ultras. He's tired of his aging identity, has doubts about the future. He wants to taste other parts of life that he missed all these past years."
Ultras,Good Drama No Football,It was a good drama but i watched film with expectations about football and there is nothing about football and stadium. It is like a underground of Napole. It was an atsmosphere about hooligans but not about football. You can find this most of Football countries. It is not also about Ultras or Apaches
Ultras,Bad,"I love italian cinema, but not this movie. The word ""ULTRAS"" is bigger to be referred to this movie"
Ultras,not bad at all,"I've never shown interest in football fans, be it true fans or ultras. Heck, I don't even care about this sport at all. However, it's happening in Naples, and after the TV show Gomorrah everything connected to the city sparks my interest.

What we have here is a somewhat predictable story with solid actors. At times it was obvious the production budget was tight, yet the authors managed to create a watchable and coherent movie.

Ultras is done in such a way that you forget your feelings about football or its fans. Above all this is a movie about human condition, choices people make and the consequences of those decisions."
Ultras,A Gritty Look at Fanaticism That Struggles to Find Its Footing,"""Ultras"" is an intense, gritty portrayal of the passionate and at times violent world of soccer fan culture in Naples, hinged on the life of an aging ultra named Sandro. The work succeeds impressively in portraying the naked energy and eventual loyalty these fan groups have toward their teams. The cinematography is equally appreciated, capturing the vibrant and turbulent atmosphere of the city. Sometimes, however, the real momentum of the narrative is not that strong; sometimes character development sounds superficial, underutilizing most of the supporting cast. Despite these drawbacks, ""Ultras"" does curate an exciting vision of a subculture in cinema that is too rarely depicted while attempting its social critique through balancing a heartfelt trawl about identity and belonging."
Ultras,If you don't know anything about Ultras you might like it,"I expected a lot more from this movie. It is supposed to be about Hooligans, but there ain't any scenes of what happens in stadiums or at soccer games. One cliché follows the other, the story and dialogues as character development could have been written by a child. The whole movie is boring, it fails to build up any tension or any sense for the actions that happen and it is full of recurring scenes about the same things like singing in choirs, senseless partying and sex scenes. The end is just utterly dumb and senseless, fitting to the rest of this easily forgettable movie. If you want to see a good and realistic hooligan film don't watch this one."
Ultras,ultras,"Ultras is a film that shows life of italian football fans and how they share together their passion for game,and spending time together and cheering for their team,wait,this film isnt about how football connects people and their love for it,it is more film about hooligans and how they destroy staff that many people love,i dont know if director wanted to show some sympathy towards them but he wasnt succesful towards me,since i live in country were hooligans also make trouble to normal life and people i was able to relate to that subject and i can say that it is made in realistic way,and that is best thing about film,ultras was a film with subject that im not big fan or supporter of,but i saw some staff that worked good to"
Ultras,Better then expected,"Didn't expect a lot, but the movie was actually very good. Excellent acting and a believable story."
Ultras,Where Are The Neo Nazis...?,"Any football fan will be familiar with the rise of the Ultras, now spread across Europe, but their heart is most definitely Italian. This luke warm and shallow depiction of the Napoli faction skipped over part of what unites them, we get the football but not the fascism. Without the politics included all we get is the mundane nature of the thug. Drugs, beer, girls & machismo. They might as well be bikers. Although we get a glimpse of the famous Italian banner culture no one watching would know that they're regimental flags that must be protected at all costs. It's a matter of honour so the burnt banner incident lost all of its importance and fails to explain why it could cause a split in the ranks. I understand why the producers avoided the politics, the Ultras will kill you, especially Napolli, they're caught up on that old lie of honour & respect with a dash of omerta. These are Neo Nazi thugs, no more, no less. We're not even shown their various Nazi salutes or get to hear their 'patriotic' songs. The acting is excellent, the locations spot on, but the story and dialogue is a bland two dimensional moral tale that violence begets violence. One day maybe someone will have the courage to make an accurate film about the Ultas and their various campaigns of racial terror, intimidation and extortion? At the moment is seems not."
Ultras,Quite bad actually,"Missing everything, from good acting to a real portrait of the ultras world. Most of the movie is about people singing songs, not much to do with football or ultras. Thankfully I saw the movie with english subtitles otherwise I wouldn't have understood what people say, since they don't speak italian."
Ultras,Ultras without Football,"The TL:DR: A film about football culture without football. Three points for showing the lives of working class people in Napoli and trying to be Ken Loach.

Long version: Even if you aren't part of the Ultras/Hooligan/Casula culture you probably have some images in your head associated with it. Now I'm not saying a filmmaker has to show reality, but if your movie is portraying a certain way of life and even claims it in the title, maybe you should make it as real as possible. With football this clearly is a budget/rights/access issue, with Ultras it even becomes political. Football clubs have a love/hate (often mir on the hate side) relationship with ""active"" fans. And the fans are very picky themselves, when it comes to their portrayal in media.

That's maybe why ""classic"" football violence and politics have been left out of this movie.

One could argue: This is just a movie for everyone, Ultras culture is just a background setting, but at the same time people it will have difficulties reading a lot of scenes without a certain knowledge of the codes and rules of said culture.

What's left is the portrayal of a slice of Neapolitan society that - I guess - tries to show the everyday grind of people and how their true god is football.

Without really showing this god. Or without accomplishing to show why this has become a facade, a ritual without meaning.

On a more structural level it is hard to sympathise with the people in Ultras. They lack dimension and motivation. I understand the time constraints of movies make this hard, but I can't shake the feeling the director feels to be part of the Ultras scene, but has a rather narrow view on the people in it. Not really condescending, but kind of how some parents can't shake of certain views they have of their child, failing to see the what their children really are capable of.

Full disclosure: I stopped watching after about an hour, because the movie just didn't come together for me at this point. I might come back and update my review, but I doubt it."
Ultras,Great movie folks,"Ultras is one movie about Napoli and the Apache one group of people who supported Napoli everywhere until their old age...Good acting,excellent photography and brilliant soundtrack...one of the best productions from Netflix!!"
Ultras,"Not bad, but.........","Better then I expected, but.... First of all, they didn't show the energy off being with ultras in a stadium, its an immersive and powerful energy, its a fundamental factor to love like that your team, your partners and your city. Your scream alone doesn't mean nothing in a stadium, but all united, it means everything. Second, it could be more realistic, they can be wayyyy more aggressive, they have a truly hard time, they just don't have that kind of jobs (if they have, isn't easy as the Sandro job looked like) and nice beautiful trips to the beach with their love, they didn't even want it....and yes, after all they are fascists and have more restricted rules then just that what the movie show. At last, I can point another mistakes, things like ""this movie just says violence generate more violence"", it tries to talk about other realities but, it just try, but the thing that make me come here and write this was the final music, never seen such a bad choice in a movie, in the most dramatic part in all off the movie they put techno instead off the beautiful and tradicional Italian songs about loss and/or love, it just ruins the ending, they already had exaggerated about the end, and with the techno instead tradicional Italian....."
Ultras,Slow and boring,"I turned it off halfway through.Totally slow moving,boring storyline and unexciting"
Ultras,Worst movie ever,"Just a bunch of thugs, talking about drugs, in a war to see who is cooler. Nonsense story, not even real violence. A waste of time."
The Truth Seekers,Good film but misunderstood,"The film is about an ultra' that is trying to quit the ultra' world, why so many people are complaining that that the stadium side isn't showed enough? it's meant to be like this, the protagonist is meant to be a window near but outside it, one of a old generation that doesn't fit in anymore, please don't ruin this film score for no reason, is a really good italian product and wasn't meant to be the representation of a day at the stadium"
The Truth Seekers,"A good film, if an entirely predictable one","A good film, if an entirely predictable one.

'Ultras' portrays the world of Italian football ultras, a thing that has always intrigued me given I follow Serie A; though admittedly I have little actual knowledge about supporter culture in Italy. Based on what I do know, I like how the film is put together. It's shot very nicely.

The acting is better than average, though Aniello Arena is the clear standout. I really enjoyed his performance as Sandro. The other cast members are all fine in their respective roles.

The premise is largely fun to watch, though from the middle of the second act the film does lose its momentum. It regains some of it for the final major event, though it stills affects my feelings towards this. The cinematography is decent, also.

Once Upon A Time,I haven't laughed this much in a long time,It reminded me of 'Que pobres tan ricos'. Both funny and fun. I like those kinds of Telenovelas.
Once Upon A Time,funny and entertaining,"This telenovela is really funny and light hearted. I really enjoyed watching it.

Some of the reviewers said that this series ""makes Latin Americans look bad."" I think this is a ridiculous review. Should we be ""disgusted"" with American culture based on ""Dumb and Dumber"" or ""Step Brothers"", or any other such comedy? Of course not. The person obviously does not understand this genre and how telenovelas work. Telenovelas usually involve over the top drama. This is also a comedy, and of course the story line is going to be ridiculous and unrealistic (in order to provide the drama). They are also going to be low budget. If you like light hearted comedy and like telenovelas, you are going to enjoy this one."
Once Upon A Time,Some stories interesting,"I had to skip forward through the ridiculous characters, Miller, Julio and Miss Marzita, but some of the other characters and story lines were interesting. I don't like it when they drag everything out for more episodes. Some of the situations were ridiculous and its make Latino men look totally idiotic and perverse. The cops look inept. Fast forwarding through some of the more nauseating scenes helped."
Once Upon A Time,It grows in the person to a point where you realize you got disgusted with this series,Endless long dialogs between super idiotic characters all of them overacting with never ending idiotic mimics with constantly open mouths trying to figure out crystal clear events. An insult to Latin Americans to portray them such uncurable idiots. All of the episodes end with an idiotic open mouth face of one or the other character trying to figure out a super simple situation.
Once Upon A Time,Crap crap crap,"This is the worse novela I have ever seen. It's a CRAP It's terrible. Watching this is soo maddening. It's very stupidly written. If you want to get angry then go ahead. When you think something you're hoping to happen will happen, it doesn't. To make this novela longer it's written stupidly. My husband is watching it and it's ridiculous.

I'm giving one star because I have to. To write this review."
Once Upon A Time,Terrible series,The worst and most ridiculos show ever. The whole cast performance is pathetic and all they look like retarded people. This show makes Colombian people like they are unethical and poor quality humans. WORST SERIES EVER DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.
Memories of Love,,
In the Dark,Lots of potential,This show has a lot of potential. The character development is starting out well. After the first episode I want to know what happened and look forward the journey with these people. I don't understand the bad reviews. It's a crime story with a different twist. Try it.
In the Dark,It's strength is that it shows weakness,"In the pilot, the main character is a drunk sex addict. It shows her as a real person and tries to delve into why she is rough and not willing to let others get close to her, including her roommate and family. Other reviewers get offended that they dare show her like this, as an addict. They say it's a bad representation of blind people. But she's not meant to be all blind people, she's meant to be her. Why does any disabled person on television have to be a shining example for all people with that disability? Answer: they don't. There are many blind people in the real world that aren't always polite and I'm sure most of them are tired of people asking why they're blind. The show goes to extremes trying to give viewers a glimpse into the life of a blind person without sugar coating it with a world of encouragement and trying so hard. It starts off well letting you know the blind character is a real person and not just included in the show for the sake of inclusion. It lets you know the character sees herself as excluded. The start of the series has a lot of potential specifically because it shows people aren't all perfect, that being blind isn't the only flaw blind people can have, and it shows a desire for change. That's the start of a good story. Identify how things actually are, identify how the character wants to change and how they will try to change. No she's not the Wonder Woman of blind people, but she is not supposed to be either. This isn't a buddy-buddy sitcom, or a teen romance, it's a dark drama."
In the Dark,Surprisingly great.,Really like this so far. Main character is likeable and it has an original plotline. Nothing like what you'd expect from CW but I like the refreshingly different outlook. Didn't have to skip any parts which I normally do when a show isn't that great. Deffo recommend checking this out!
In the Dark,Curious. How many negative reviews are from sighted folks?,"Murphy, the blind, drunken character, has altered my view of myself, others and the world.

I lost my vision 4 years ago and have struggled to adapt to being ostracized by the general populace. I am often invisible or ignored. Murphy makes a clear and vivid point of not being invisible. I now have the courage to accidentally tap someone, or brush up next to them, without fear of what they think of me. I now go into restaurants and other places with no anxiety. I won't go to the extreme Murphy does, although I find it amusing.

For the concerns in re of blind folks in the positive and negative reviews; There are various degrees of blindness. Some do wear make up which they apply themselves. Some do look at others when conversing, especially if they were once sighted. Some can see contrast, facial features, large objects, etc. There are plenty of blogs and videos online if you're inquisitive.

If your concerns are because you know one blind person one should not base their experience solely on that specific blind person. All women are not the same, all men are not the same, all dogs are not the same, you get the picture?

As for the issue of race. When I 'watch' something I know nothing of race unless it is part of the character's lines. The most wonderful aspect of being blind is I can not judge, or misjudge, others based on their skin, eye or hair color, nor their size, face and clothing.

Unless one is visually impaired one has no experience to express anything negative about Murphy's blindness, and the awkwardness of living in a society of sighted, misunderstanding folks. You're merely expressing an opinion which we all know what that really indicates.

Going blind is a blessing for me."
In the Dark,"such hate, and guess what, RENEWED for 2nd season","Guess what, disabled people are just like everyone else. They have casual sex, drink, smoke, have messed up lives. The people saying how badly it portrays blind/disabled people, watch Daredevil. There are also disabled people that have great lives, don't have causal sex, drink, smoke, etc. So to hate this show because it shows the former is ridiculous. And who can't love a show with a dog??? I have to wonder what the dog, Pretzel, thinks having to be there while she has sex. Is the dog thinking, I wish it were me, or enough already??? The season 1 finale was great and brought so many points together."
In the Dark,Potential!,"Yes, she is a mess! She is not perfect! She doesn't represent the ""ideal"" female role. But she is human, as such, she is not perfect. This show has a lot of potential, hopefully it won't get lost in the middle of all this PC BS!!!"
In the Dark,I'm intrigued and want to see more,"I think this show has lots of potential. As others have said it is going a different route, it's dark and twisty. I am also glad it's not another typical teen drama and it's a refreshing change from superheroes. I hope the story line continues to develop and that I get to see more."
In the Dark,Good start - hope it follows through,"I was expecting to hate this show - I wanted to hate it. I fought all my life to be treated as an equal, and then some idiot decides to portray a blind woman as a drunken, self-pitying mess who sleeps with married strangers and exploits her disability to cut the line at the drug store? Gee, thanks...

So I was very surprised to find I didn't hate it - not even a little. Let's start with the things this show does well - it's funny. Not laugh-out-loud funny - because we all know it's rude to laugh at the blind, right? - but quietly funny. Murphy's roommate (Brooke Markham) proves that a woman doesn't have to be tall and skinny to be beautiful. Kudos to Hollywood for finally accepting what the rest of us have known all along. I love the neurotic mom, whose entire identity is wrapped up in being the mother of a disabled child, because even though the non-disabled world may not realize it, that's a thing. And I love that we are finally seeing a blind person who is not a saint, a victim or a superhero.

I've only seen the first episode, so I don't know if Murphy's bereavement will be the catalyst that shocks her back into the real world, but I sure hope so because this could be a good show if it follows a young woman's journey from someone who is defined by her limitations to someone who can see beyond her limits."
In the Dark,Just now catching onto this show...,"While it's a good cast that works well together, Murphy is a bit all over the place; can't stand Dean; Jess is likable but let's face the cold hard facts...Pretzel is the real star of the show!!!"
In the Dark,It's actually pretty decent for a CW show,"The lead character is likable, as is the rest of the cast. They're adults instead of annoying teenagers, by adults I mean in their 20's, which is refreshing for a CW show. Now that it's on Netflix it will reach a wider audience, and while I admit I gave up on it a few times while attempting to binge watch it, I always managed to come back to see what happened, and i'm Glad I did. Nothing groundbreaking here, but it's a decent mystery, with some twists, while also managing to be comedy/drama with likable characters."
In the Dark,Good show,"I am glad I started watching this show about a blind lady who assists in solving her friend's murder. Her character is understandably a bit flawed, but is still a good and fleshed character. I like each episode as each is good to watch."
In the Dark,3rd season ruined it,"Season 1 and 2 were gripping, entertaining and fun to watch. Binge watched them, actually. Season 3, however, is so far-fetched, dragged out while being extremely boring, I kept fast forwarding for something to happen. Really disappointing."
In the Dark,I enjoyed season 1 &2,"I like the premise of the show. In season 3, however, Murphy is just extremely obnoxious and stubborn. I mean she's annoying in the first 2 seasons, but in season 3 she is at a whole new level. She's so stupid to treat other people like crap when she needs their help throughout the show. It makes it very frustrating to watch at times. Other than that, the show is fun to watch."
In the Dark,Only saw the Pilot so far,"Good Lord! What idiot would think that this depicts ALL blind people as alcoholics, desperate and willing to crawl into bed with anyone? Ugh. In the same vein, I guess Elementary depicts ALL private detectives as narcissists, users of women and yes...alcoholics.

I like the first show so far. I like the star. Love the dog (even if we don't know yet if the dog is neurotic). I thought the pilot was great."
In the Dark,Looking forward to more episodes!,"I thought the pilot was inspiring to be given a chance...I like the main character very much, which usually doesn't happen for me in the pilot most times. I have to search way more than I did for this one. I've already become attached to her and the supporting characters. And, I appreciate the no nonsense approach to people with special needs as well as other marginalized demographics. I saw authentic and good expression of humanity and love. I'll be watching this series."
In the Dark,Great new show,"Just watched the pilot , funny held my interest great characters! Cant wait to watch the next episode!"
In the Dark,"Excellent format for crime drama, even giggle fits!","I am completely invested and have watched all episodes so far. Every time you think you have a idea what's happened a twist is afoot. Loads of shock moments and lots of actual side splitting scenes too. Great storyline and love the characters, good and bad!"
In the Dark,"Good first season, but don't dare watch season 2",Comentario no disponible
In the Dark,Glad i gave it a chance,"It took me awhile to start watching this show but so glad I did. I think its the most undiscovered and underrated show. Glad its finally on netflix for more people to discover. The show is very intreguing and different. Excellent casting and storyline. Its got comedy, drama a a tad bit of suspense. A great mixture. Great show, highly recommended."

In the Dark,Murphy is annoying.,"The ONLY reason i'm on here is to say that this show is like a bad car wreck. I have to watch it but Murphy is so self sabotaging, toxic and annoying. I can't take it. I've never hated a main character who is supposed to be loved so much.

I don't understand how she even has friends. I would have ran from her the minute she started talking. She also is a hooch. Gosh she does everything that moves it's disgusting actually how often it happens. I can't stand this character. She needs help.

I will say I love Felix, he's a great character and great comic relief. We need more feliz and less Jess.

Ok rant over."
In the Dark,"First season drew me in, 3rd is killing me.","Yes, I got over the fact that Murphy is a horrible, no-good person. Yes, I got over the fact that half the time it's unbelievable that she is even blind. Yes, I enjoyed Season 1-mostly for Pretzel and Max.

Season 2 was too much. Seriously, I understand that it's a TV show and drama and whathaveyou are necessary, but there's a point where it just becomes too much. Toning it down a bit would have made just as much drama without the eye rolls.

Season 3 is just so bad, for me. I'm sticking with it, because I'm invested and I'm hardheaded.

If there's ever a survey on who the most unlikeable characters in television history are and Murphy is not one of them, then I'm calling bull.

Obviously this is just my opinion."
In the Dark,Enjoyable though not totally believable,"I really enjoy this show - though I have to look past some things. The story is good, the characters are likable and interesting, the mystery keeps you guessing, and it has a little bit of everything - suspense, mystery, comedy, and drama.

The only thing that isn't so great is the portrayal of the blind character ... and its not all the actor's fault because obviously some of the stuff was written into the script. I mean ... what blind person is going to create a visual flow chart to explain connections? Seriously ... lol ... that was so ridiculous. She also appears to make eye contact many times throughout and almost doesn't appear to be blind. One could argue that she is looking in the direction of their voice ... but its too spot on to be believable."
In the Dark,Great potential,"Honest, it deserved more like 8 stars for me but I feel the need to compensate for those who unfairly judged this show. You can judge the actors' performance (great btw) or the plot (intriguing so far) but being that hateful because the heroine is blind yet still human and, as such, imperfect, is wrong. The show is great so far, I really felt for Murphy. She's a mess, she knows she's a mess and she tries to do better. It's not that easy of course. But she's also loving, very loyal and willing to change. The best thing people can do is admit their fault and try to work on themselves. I don't understand what's upsetting in this show. As a 32 year old woman, I feel well represented in Murphy because she's just a little lost and really, who isn't? It really doesn't matter that she's blind or not, it's about more than disability and those who speak about feminism and showing a ""perfect woman"" are probably those who don't understand this issue at all."
NCIS,,
Quincy,Very enjoyable yet also very formulaic,"I have enjoyed Quincy for years--both when it first came on TV and in the years following its wide-spread syndication. Despite enjoying the show very much, I must, however, admit that the show was very formulaic and predictable. In 90% of the episodes, they stuck one of two very well-established plot outlines:

1. There is a death and it's assumed that it was by natural causes. In most of these cases, it's actually murder.

2. To Dr. Quincy, the case ""just doesn't seem right"" and he won't close the case--wanting to take more time with the autopsy or do some investigating on his own.

3. His boss, Dr. Asten, argues with Quincy to just wrap it all up due to either time constraints or pressure from outside sources. In essence, Asten is a bureaucratic weenie and Quincy a crusader for truth.

4. Quincy's friend, Lt. Monahan, wants to close the case because he KNOWS that it either wasn't a murder or he's blaming some innocent guy for the crime. Oddly, despite the Los Angeles Police Department being one of the largest ones in the world, somehow Monahan is almost always on the case--he's apparently a very, very busy guy--as is Quincy!

5. In the end, Quincy is vindicated. Yet, despite this, by the time they do the next episode, they once again begin this same process!

6. They all end up at Danny's and someone says something funny.

OR:

1. A death occurs.

2. Dr. Quincy becomes angry because the death was caused by some social issue such as spousal abuse, sexual abuse or poorly staffed emergency care centers, so he goes on a rampage and annoys practically everyone.

3. Quincy grandstands, makes speeches and preaches not just to the folks in the show but AT the audience.

4. Folks FINALLY listen to Quincy and they all end up at Danny's restaurant. But because it's a social issue program, they may or may not say something funny to end the show.

So why, despite the predictability of the show did I and so many others like it? Well, perhaps it was because although you knew what to expect in general, the shows were very creative in how they thought out the murders. Also, in a few cases, there weren't murders but the show managed to bring up excellent public health issues (though occasionally they were VERY preachy). Plus, over the years, the show evolved into a likable cast. Heck, after a while, you even grew to like Asten--especially since he mellowed and was less of a paper-pushing bureaucrat in later episodes.

Excellent writing, a likable cast and great imagination, this show has stood up well over time.

UPDATE: I just finished re-watching the entire series and think I should update my review. As the show progressed, the quality of the shows began to decline. The decline was slow at first but by season eight, the shows were just awful. I assume they ran out of ideas for crimes to solve, as more and more as the show progressed the shows became soapboxes for social ills NOT shows about forensic science. And, soapbox shows, while perhaps important, are far, far less entertaining."
Quincy,Engaging human drama of a coroner with class,"I absolutely loved this series about a coroner's experiences, and have tried in recent years to find a TV replacement, all to no avail. Cold Case Files is bearable (but no Quincy) while CSI is both dark & stark and far too graphic. No opportunity is lost to display blood and guts, generally at the expense of character and plot. Why people view this as entertainment befuddles me. Crossing Jordan is yet another dark tale and generally as concerned with Jordan's sex life as with crime investigation.

By contrast, Quincy is very engaging but also optimistic. Yes, Quincy has his 'relationships' with beautiful young women, but they are portrayed light heartedly, with humour and minimal focus. Jack Klugman is brilliant in the role of the smart & tough, kind hearted & principled, grumpy but charismatic coroner. He is always the underdog's champion, indignant at the crimes & cover ups of the wealthy and influential, and not hesitant to ruffle a few feathers. Quincy is always professional but also personally engaged in the victim's plight. Each episode sees him ferreting out some new case of foul play, aided by his faithful Oriental lab cohort, Sam, engagingly played by Robert Ito. The pair enjoy a touching friendship.

The series gave us a glimpse into the forensic techniques and research of that era. (These may have improved during the intervening decades but alas, the TV series portraying them have not.) Also, many issues equally relevant today were explored, including child abuse, fad diets, alcoholism, child pornography, and so forth. Who cares whether aspects of the show are predictable or whether it is particularly realistic? I for one remain a great fan of the series. As I see it, all the forensic dramas of today pale by comparison."
Quincy,Entertaining Mystery Show Morphs into Soapbox,"Though Quincy began its run as a great mystery show, it all too soon evolved into a vehicle for discussion of the social issues of the day. Unlike Columbo, which maintained a reputation for sticking to good storytelling and suspense, Quincy started using violent incidents as an excuse to comment on gun control, spousal abuse, religious bigotry, etc. While it's important to be aware of societal ills, it's also important to understand that as soon as a storyteller starts ""lecturing,"" the story suffers, and the audience leaves. And when producers, directors, and actors lose sight of the balance needed between telling a story and discussing the issues of the day, their show goes into decline. Trying to merge story and message is like mixing liver and ice cream; it can be done, but who's going to want the product? When Quincy stuck to storytelling, it was entertaining, but when stories took a backseat to ""messages,"" it jumped the shark every time."
Quincy,Brilliant,"The laws of 'Quincy'

1. No more than 5 minutes shall pass before Quincy yells 'Dammit!'

2. At least once an episode, Sam (Quincy's Asiatic sidekick) has to say 'I don't like it Quince'

3. Every woman, even if they are young enough to be his granddaughters, has to find Quincy unbearably attractive

4. No cop is allowed to point out that he is a pathologist, and investigating crimes is way outside the limits of his job

5. There shall never be a suprising death

6. Quincy's boss always has to object to his investigation at first, be won slowly round, and then appear, supporting, in the final denouncement

7. Not one person is allowed to point out that there are probably bodies rotting in the aisles, considering the amount of time he spends investigating just the one death

God I love this show......"
Quincy,Shake 'n Bake TV,"I think Quincy was great when it first aired but is reflective of the ""Shake 'n Bake"" formula of TV in the '70s and early '80s. It did bring the science of criminal forensics to public attention so I am sure there are people working in that field today because of Quincy.

An episode or two might be tolerable for most people, but beyond that the repetition will wear almost anyone down.

I think I would pay real money if for once his boss Asten, Lt. Monahan and everyone else would believe Quincy when he finds something out of the ordinary.

Something like,""Gee Quincy, you were right about all of the last 75 deaths you investigated when I didn't believe you despite considering you my friend. Since your record is pretty flawless and I can trust you, let's go get the murderer."" I would love to see that just once...once!"
Quincy,CSI before there was a CSI!,"This show was more influential than most shows of its genre on TV. In many ways, it was the predecessor to the current CSI and CSI: Miami, with its emphasis on science and the forensic approach. In fact, many of the episodes dealt with forensic methods which were just coming into being in the 70's, and for the first time let the audience of the series see these new techniques and research, including the build-up of a skeletal face to what the person could have looked like, looking for evidence of where a person has been by looking at the residue on a person's shoes and other forensic methods we take for granted nowadays.

What's even more interesting is that many of the topics of these episodes, some 25 years old, show a great amount of relevance even now. Such things as airplane safety, epidemics, political influence, riots, runaways and child pornography, post traumatic stress disorder as a result of a war experience, migrant workers, crash diets, child abuse, and much, much more.

This show was and is a great forerunner to many other shows over the past twenty-five years. In many ways, the current resurgence in shows about forensic science can be attributed to this show. Not only the commercial successes of CSI and CSI:Miami, but shows like ""Forensic Files,"" ""Cold Case Files"" and other such shows. With the amount of technology which we presently have available to us now, it's amazing that a lot of it has only been available since Quincy debuted on television, less than 25 years ago."
Quincy,Quincy shifted a lot over its seven year run,"In the beginning, the show was usually about a crime that Quincy solves using his skills as a medical examiner., sometimes officially, sometimes not so officially, as he did when he was on jury duty on one episode. Honestly, who would allow a medical examiner to sit on a jury in a criminal trial? But I digress. These whodunnit based episodes were interesting, and Quincy is one of the first of the CSI style shows that I can recall - it really was ahead of its time. But, especially in the last couple of years of the show, there was a shift and Klugman started doing lots of issue shows with lots of pontificating. This was probably partially due to the changing times, partially a reaction to the Reagan administration. You can see the same kind of thing happen to the show Lou Grant and its star Edward Asner during the same time frame.

Of course, crime scene investigation techniques have changed a lot over the years, and the ability to analyze DNA evidence was a ground breaker that was far in the future when this show debuted, but it is still worth it for the acting and the amazing Jack Klugman."
Quincy,Quincy rules!,"I miss those days when quincy was shown at TV here in Norway. The show was just pure magic. On one side Quincy was the relenteless detective/coroner who gave everything on the job. On the other side he also liked to shoot the breeze, drink, chase woman and have fun. That's what it is all about. The 70's were a dream considering TV series. Just think about cannon, Kojak and Quincy. JUST GREAT. Quincy is ""old school, funny and a delight to watch. The style of the 70's seems so much more relaxed and cool compared to that of today.Recommended for everybody that's tired of all the crap shown to day. The 70's rule and Quincy is number one!"
Quincy,The same thing each episode,"Each episode is usually the same setup. There's a death and no one believes Quincy when he finds out how they died. His own boss always fights him and never believes him and they spend half the episode shouting back and forth to each other with Quincy usually saying ""I can prove it!"" You'd think after a few times, the boss would be like ""Ok Quincy, you've shown me before, I have faith in you. Do your job!"" But no, he yells and says he doesn't believe him and how he has absolutely no clue what he's doing in his job lol. Then why does he keep him working there?!

Then by the end of the episode, Quincy proves himself correct and the others have egg on their face. But they all quickly forget because they go through the same song and dance with each other in the next episode and the next.... It gets pretty monotonous after a while. If I were Quincy, I would've found a new place to work with a boss that appreciated me better."
Quincy,Formulaic yet groundbreaking,"It has struck me that despite the implausible pairing of Quincy with much younger women, the clashes with the management and the police, this show covered some pretty controversial topics for a 30 year old mainstream show:- * Teenage alcoholism * Elder abuse * Mental health issues * Legislation for lief jackets on plains * Drunk driving *Public health issues such as food contamination/pollution Yes it can be cheesy but I still find many of them watchable and find the range of issues covered impressive for the times. I also think it's quite cool that Mark was actually a technician not an actor who is now a leading DNA expert!"

Quincy,A coroner who does police work,"A coroner who investigates. The police union must be mad. I liked the show as a kid, but as an adult I find the show far fetched. Some good episodes. The science is the interesting part. I think maybe this is where the show Crossing Jordan takes up. The medical examiner that does autopsies and investigates. Anyone remember the death touch episode? It's murder was a line in every second show. This is like that new show with is based in 3 different cities. The show went on 2 years too long. The networks never know when to end these series. 3/5. Worth watching a second time. A bit over the top! Sam was he on Star Trek? I wonder if they will make a remake comedy on this show? Sort of like CSI too."
Quincy,The extra mile,"When I started working for the NYS Crime Victims Board and occasionally had to send for autopsy reports I'm afraid it soured me on this series. Jack Klugman was far more dedicated to his job and to doing the job of the police than any coroner I ever dealt with. In fact on a personal level I had a sister who died at 34 and an autopsy was ordered as it naturally would be. The report we eventually got some nine months later gave a clinical analysis of the corpse and certain tests, but came to zero conclusions about how my sister died. Now maybe Jack Klugman would have found out on the show, but I ran into no Klugmans in my professional or personal life.

But Quincy would always go an extra few miles with his trusted assistant Robert Ito until he was proved right. Of course he always was. Klugman also had to deal with his supervisor John S. Ragin who had a lot of corpses to be disposed of and little time for the individual attention Klugman gave those cases we saw.

But if Klugman had problems with Ragin there were nothing compared to those he had with detectives Garry Walberg and Joseph Roman who naturally resented him doing their jobs. The resentments never lasted long though.

My favorite parts of the show were always in their hangout where Klugman got together with Ito, Walberg, Ragin, and Roman at Danny's, a nice cozy little piano bar with good food, good drinks, and good company. In fact my favorite character in the show was Val Bisoglio as your genial host Danny. It was nice to see that the conflicts during the show never came into Danny's. It looked like such a great place to hang out.

But if you think medical examiners are as dedicated as Quincy you will be sadly disillusioned as I was."
Quincy,"""PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE HERE!!""","This is the king of formula shows. Every single episode goes down the same way:

Quincy has just gotten off of a particularly grueling case.

The boss brings in a new body that Quincy ""just has to look at"".

Sam, his ever faithful assistant, is just about to leave for the night before Quincy calls him back. ""I need you to stay and figure this one out.""

They show the 'late-night working montage', which always consists of Sam running spectral analysis tests while Quincy pokes at the body.

The montage ends, and Sam says ""I don't like the looks of this Quince"".

Quincy then insults Sam about the quality of his coffee.

Quincy puts on his detective hat, and interviews witnesses.

Quincy will come against opposition to him solving the case, and he will yell at that person. In fact, he will have been yelling for most of the episode, but now the yelling is of a righteous nature.

Quincy will confront his main adversary and scream, ""PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE HERE!!""

Quincy's boss, who was against all meddling from the start, eventually comes around.

Quincy solves the case, then explains everything over breakfast/lunch/dinner with his pals.

Someone at the table tells a throw-away joke, usually at Quincy's expense, leaving everyone in stitches.

Roll credits.

Eat your heart out, Jordan Cavanaugh"
Quincy,A Little Hard to Watch 40 years later,"Quincy TV series started when I was 13 years old, and I thought it was an amazing and great show. I understood why Quincy was upset that nobody ever saw the wisdom of his words until he could prove it with science. Nobody ever listened to Quincy, and so he was usually angry. The stories were usually pretty good too. Most of the time, they used interesting ideas and science information that was cutting edge back in the 1970s.

Forty years later, I have tried to enjoy Quincy like I did when I was young, and I find that he is usually too harsh. His abrasive personality is mean to many of the people that support him the most. Additionally, Quincy has no respect for anyone at his Medical Examiner's Office.

Now when I watch this show, most of the time I am counting all the reasons that Quincy should get terminated from his position during each episode. Quincy violates various standing rules of his Medical Examiner's Office; he regularly violates direct orders from his boss, Dr. Astin (played by John S. Ragin), and sometimes he breaks the law too. In the real world, Quincy would be getting terminated in almost every episode of his show.

However, I will always remember Quincy fondly, because he has good intentions, and tries to do the right thing. Back when I was a kid, I thought that yelling at your boss every day was pretty cool. Quincy did everything ""his way,"" and that was alright by me."
Quincy,Formulaic yet engrossing,"I do agree that some of the plot lines can fall on the formulaic side, but I can't help liking Quincy M.E. all the same. The locations, scenery and photography are striking, and the music is above decent too. As is the direction, and even the most formulaic of story lines have their fun and engrossing spots. The pacing is pretty solid, while the writing and characters are engaging enough, the writing having wit and humour and the characters lead and supporting likable and fun. The acting I don't have a problem with, Jack Klugman is great as Quincy, who has his flaws such as being grumpy on occasions but is still charismatic, kind-hearted and clever, while Sam is a nice character and engagingly played. To conclude, a very nice if formulaic show. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
Quincy,The original crime scene investigator with passion,"Watching all 8 seasons of Quincy ME. I was 13 when series first aired and I enjoyed watching the mystery of the stories, but I was impacted by the passion and dedication to bring about change for many things in our society with the aid of science. It was, in no way, a typical 70s show. I first learned about sickle cell anemia from this show. Was educated on industrial waste, drug abuse, child abuse, and all types of bad elements in society, but through a shielded lens of television networks of the time. I was enthralled by the field of pathology and that carried over into the later shows like CSI shows and NCIS. I wasn't confident enough in my intelligence to pursue that field, but many days I wish I had. This show was socially impactful and despite the age, holds up!"

Quincy,The perfect mystery show,"""Quincy,M.E."",premiered on NBC-TV in October of 1976,and ended its run in April of 1982. The original was one of the last series to be created for the NBC Mystery Movie strand which consisted of the shows,""McCloud"", ""MacMillian and Wife"",""Banacek"",and also ""Columbo"" which was on the same network. However,the series became part of a two-hour movie series intitled ""Quincy"",but the name changed after the Peacock network cancelled the movie series in 1976. This is where the series takes off and it was a combination of several things that may this a great show. First off,Quincy was played by the great Jack Klugman,who before the series aired was Oscar Madison for five seasons on the TV version of Neil Simon's ""The Odd Couple"",which was on a rival network.

Klugman had a style and substance to the role where he can make his character looked serious and sometimes humourous at the same time(watch the episodes to see my point),but had a knack for solving cases for the police,uncover the proof of foul play against impossible odds,and go beyond the lengths to help the authorities catch the killer or suspects that were involved. Then after solving another grueling case,he's back onto another one leading to more clues and surprises at every turn.

This show during its run was in the top ten and was a grand favorites against competitors like from other detective shows like Kojak,Barnaby Jones,and Baretta,not to mention Starsky and Hutch. However,the show was a inspiration for such shows today as Crossing Jordan and CSI:Crime Scene Investigation,not to mention in this category Diagonsis:Murder.

Its is amazing that they don't make shows like this anymore,but Quincy was very good. One of the best from the mid-1970's. However,during its last season,the ratings slipped,and in 1982 the show was cancelled,and its replacement show over at NBC was that of a man and his talking car which....well you know the rest of the story...............

Catch the episodes everyday on the Hallmark channel."
Quincy,"Science, Dialog, and Drama...without vacuous and flashy imagery.","Quincy ME brought us the fascinating world of Forensic Pathology and yes, even crime scene investigation 30 years before we would be flooded with analogous programs. However, Jack Klugman seemed to be able to pull it off without lavish and superfluous special effects seen all too much in the modern era. Instead, Quincy was disciplined in the drama of the storyline, and the science that was involved. Perhaps the Television of today has doubts about their actual content and dialog, that vacuous imagery has been made a cornerstone, rather than window dressing.

Not to mention, Jack Klugman is just a terrific performer. Proving here, just as he has done his entire career that range is not a problem for the actor. We laughed out laud with him in the ""Odd Couple"", and here we piece together a victims death, along with Sam ,Lt. Monahan, and Astin. As always with Quincy, you are in for a good does of education too.

However, towards the later seasons, it seemed that the show became too preachy with its public service tone. I remember being a bit annoyed as certain episodes resembled after school specials, rather than the medical/ crime drama I became addicted too. It would have been a better choice for Quincy to stick with Pathology, and dish out the social commentary's in much smaller portions.

In any case, no matter what metric is used to measure Quincy with its crowded (how many CSI's do we need?) modern counterparts, I believe Dr Quincy emerges the most believable and cognitive of the group."
Quincy,"Way Ahead of its Time! If you like CSI, check it out","This show was SO FAR ahead of its time on many of today's issues. I bet it was VERY groundbreaking in the 70s and 80s. It covers topics liked botched plastic surgery, racism, elder abuse, domestic abuse and so many more. There are many fabulous mysteries medical and criminal. The show is exciting but has a lighthearted spirit too with humor and camaraderie between the medical staff and police. Sure there are some episodes which miss the mark but the majority are brilliant and intriguing. Jack Klugman is a lovable and brilliant medical examiner who really cares about each case and won't stop until each one is concluded no matter what the consequences. His assistant Sam Fujiyama is loyal and super charming. Give this show a watch! It's phenomenal!"
Quincy,Great show. One puzzle though.,"Quincy was a great show with some very good and relevant episodes, covering environmental, epidemics, cot death, legal and medical loopholes. Jack Klugman was perfect for the role and the banter between his character, Asten and Monaghan was excellent.

There is one puzzle though, what was the point of two of the characters, Danny and Sergeant Brill? The character of Danny did bring some humour to the show, but the part was mostly a couple of minutes at the end of the show. Not much of a part! Sergeant Brill's part was even more pointless than Danny's! Playing second fiddle to Monaghan, the part was virtually pointless, he rarely had anything significant to say, it was almost as if he was just given token lines to say."

Bella and the Bulldogs,A Good Teenage Series,"This is a fine teenage series for viewers to watch. It is fun to watch. The storyline could have been a bit better but it was still strong and it carried itself throughout the whole series. The cast selection was great. They committed and connected smoothly to the storyline. These kind of teenage series reveal and help in multiple ways. They are heaps of fun to watch and enjoy. I live a real difficult life. These kind of teenage series help me escape from all of that and teach me some things that can help anyone in life. This is a good and fine teenage series for all viewers to watch, enjoy, and experience fun."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Kind of expected more,"I absolutely love the message the show puts out. It shows that girls can and will do anything that boys can do, and it also shows that a girl can be ""girly"" in a sense, but can also love football and more masculine things. I also like how it shows that not all boys are tough and manly, like Newt.

One thing that I hugely hate is how many stereotypes are portrayed. It makes me mad how almost everyone is somehow against a girl being on a football team. ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. Why are people mad at the coach that a girl is on the team? Its a middle school football team, not the NFL.

I feel like the show is trying to send out a good message, but fails in some ways. The way absolutely all of the female characters are all very girlish is just boring to me. Maybe Bella could not be the tomboyish one, but maybe one of her friends in the least? It sends out the message that all girls must love skirts and high heels, but in reality lots don't.

I also largely dislike the toxic masculinity portrayed. I get that while some boys can like more masculine things, not all do. I hate how the coach once said something like ""Men hide their feelings deep down inside, and burn the map."" Really? Then Bella replies back with something like ""Well boys can do that, but not girls"" Huh???? How come males have to hide their feelings, but girls just wear their hearts on their sleeve? It makes me pressed in a way that in the 3rd or 4th episode the whole school shames them for liking a ""GiRlY"" song. MEN CAN LIKE GIRLY SONGS??? UGHH.

I personally don't like the acting in general. Maybe im looking into it too deep for a childrens TV show, but all of the acting just seems so fake. It surprises me that the actor of Bella is the worst one of all, but everyone else is on about the same level of bad acting.

Overall, I expected more from a show with this storyline, so it leaves me dissapointed. I wanted more from a show like this, but it got cancelled after season 2 anyways."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"It's alright for its genre, but there's one glaring problem.","""Bella and the Bulldogs"" sets an unrealistic expectation for women to be as good as men."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Seemed alright at first, noticed one glaring problem","This show does a wonderful job of bringing women up, making them feel good, adequate, skilled, and broke gender stereotypes...while tearing down the another gender. This show seems obsessed with contrasting boys with girls, girls are strong, can do anything they set their minds to, and are sweet and thoughtful. The boys are dirty, savage, they bring down girls and treat them like garbage, they attack others psychologically, and NEED TO SMELL DIRTY SOCKS TO SURVIVE DEODORANT, yeah, great job, you broke stereotypes for one gender, while simultaneously bringing down another and frankly alienating me, a male, by perpetuating stereotypes and making males seem like barbarians in comparison to the noble, well groomed females."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Another useless show that enforces stupid and false stereotypes.,Comentario no disponible
Bella and the Bulldogs,No stereotypes and a fun show for kids,"Reviews here are hilarious. People claiming there are stereotypes do so because they are blinded by their own stereotypes. A girl that likes football doesn't have to be tomboyish and manly. She can as well like pink and glitter. So this portrayal of Bella actually goes against all stereotypes. Same goes for the rest. Some boys have masculine features, others are more soft. Some thing they are supposed to be tougher and not like certain songs for example, but they learn that it doesn't matter. Most have no Texas accent, but still people who have one exist so we see one as well.

And what is the nonsense about guys being too skinny for football? Those are middle school players, not the professional NFL team. They may all become bigger or choose to become a scientist instead in a few years. Please, those are kids.

Well besides the nonsense that people are saying the show is pretty entertaining for the kids and offers a lot of characters with diverse personalities. I loved little Newt and Ace, they were hilarious. The rest of characters were also a good addition to the show and made us laugh. When it comes to acting one can see that some are already pretty good. somehow it was Brec Bassinger (Bella) whose acting I thought was the worst. And yet as I see she had more jobs after, maybe she improved.

The adults on the show, like on most kid's shows are side characters and for the most part not very smart. Which is needed for the shows where kids are in total charge of the situation. But they are still very fun and great. I love the coach for example. He is the best adult on the show being funny and supportive."

Bella and the Bulldogs,Sweet and fun to watch,"These reviews are ridiculous. This show is supposed to be for kids, they don't care about all that. Bella is a great role model for young girls. I watch with my little brothers and actually enjoy this. It's much better than the shows on Disney channel such as ""Austin and Ally"" and ""K C undercover"" which make me cringe. This show has heart and I recommend for families. I even watch it alone sometimes! I think that the characters Troy and Pepper are a bit bland and in need of development but other than that, great! I also think that it would be cool if we got to see more of the other characters families and lives away from their school. The jokes aren't as corny as most of the shows. I give it an 8 out of 10!"

Bella and the Bulldogs,Great series,"Sorry please translated via browser translator. The entire 20th century, the beautiful half of humanity fought for their rights, and very sad to read comments that Bella and Bulldogs is a maiden film. No, it is not. What, then, teaches the series? He teaches: 1) the Goodness - nobody in the film is not complete evil. Yes, in the beginning the guys have done nicely, and Troy could be vindictive, but that did not happen. Because on scenario Troy leader, and to the same, not stupid, and with the heart. How many times has he helped Belle; 2) communicating with the opposite sex - it's no secret that girls Mature early. Bella is not only good at football, but also has become a real team leader. There is no pressure from the team, only that team member of the opposite sex. Bell fully adopted and recognized; 3) Labor and determination. To all maniacs (those who consider women not worthy, or second-rate) the film will answer that work will return with percent all investments. Bella is not just from the street joined the team. She set a goal and achieved it. But not kissing up to anyone, and persistently practicing; 4) to continue point 3, the film will teach the next generation that the notion of ""weak gender"" should withdraw in past. In the life of men who grew up under the motto: male king, will be very difficult. I'm not such a knockout, or I agree with women directly, just a modern and future model of society, built on equality. And women prove that they are not inferior to men. Moreover, they begin to surpass them. All thanks to such films. Examples: women occupy high positions - Germany, YouTube has a lot of videos, when a woman wins men in a hand-to-hand fight, etc. etc; 5) Bella and the Bulldogs have been taught that life must be to work in a team, whatever it motley was not. At the same time, you can not relax, otherwise the payment will come very quickly. In fact, the film has a lot of positive material. Why should only the movie girlfriend Bella?"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Crap Show! More Feminist Garbage with Terrible Stereotypes,"Another crappy Nickelodeon sitcom. The show revolves around a girl named Bella who was once a cheerleader but somehow managed to get starting quarterback on the football team because she randomly threw a football like 30 feet across the field.

The characters are all horrible stereotypes. Bella is an annoying perky spoiled white girl. Yawn.....She is no different then the other female Nickelodeon leads like Tori Vega, Carly Shay, Taylor Hathaway. She's a perfect Mary-Sue who gets everything she wants. Newt is the nerdy corny white kid who gets picked on. Troy is pompous hotheaded arrogant douche swag black kid who think's he's all that. Sawyer is juts a tall redneck dude with a horrible country accent, Sophie is the sassy tough Latina chick, Pepper is annoying little prissy Asian who was adopted by white parents. What is with that Ace Mcfumbles kid and his black friend sidekick. They're pointless, unfunny and add nothing to the show.

A girl allowed in the boys locker room is okay??? They would never due a boy in the girls locker room. Both sides are inappropriate.

Troy and Sawyer are the skinniest football players I've ever seen. Also, how did a midget twerp like Newt who looks like a 7 year old end up on the football None of these guys size would be on the professional football team. The stereotypes are horrible. Why does Bella and her friends have to be such a giggly ditsy girly girls. Her football is covered in colorful rhinestones, her locker area is all pink, fluffy and covered with flowers, she and her friends can't live without make-up, Bella's perfectly curled hair. All the guys on the football team are sexist jerks. The attempts at catchphrases are pathetic! Bella's ""Sha-BooYA"" and Newt's ""Who said that"" are both equally lame, unfunny, and corny. The opening theme song is atrocious. Way not to be subtle with using songs like Taylor Swifts ""Shake it Off"" and Kelly Clarkson's ""Stronger"". We get it GIRL POWAH!

Stupid concept. Stupid show. Enough of this politically correct agenda that is shoving it's way into film and now television. A female linebacker in the NFL? Give me a break! I'm sick of this forced girl power garbage. I have the same problem with the new show on Fox called Pitch which has a similar premise except with baseball."
Bella and the Bulldogs,My thoughts,"No offense but I don't understand why this show actually has fans. The plot and acting are terrible, the characters are forgettable, it's overly girly, the theme song sounds like one of those kiddie songs that's a hit with first grade girls, and it crams morals and such down our throats. So yeah, I never liked this show, but admittedly, I didn't hate it at first. The reason I went from just not liking it to hating it is because most of this show's fans treat me like I'm some kind of crazy for not liking it. Meanwhile, I like Nicky Ricky Dicky & Dawn because it's the exact opposite. It teaches you that you can always work together with family, but in a way that's fun and entertaining. And I've never heard of any of its fans mistreating haters for their opinion. Anyway, I recommend this show to 7 year olds, but if you're looking for a show for families, I recommend Nicky Ricky Dicky & Dawn instead. :)"

Bella and the Bulldogs,Boring,Terrible show and very bad acting!!! This show only got 2 seasons for a reason and the main reason was the actress in this show. She is not talented!!!
Bella and the Bulldogs,Such a good show!,"I can't believe this show only had one season! It was so good. Funny and lighthearted but also full of great messages, especially the finale. I wish they'd made more!"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Agonizing,"I really wanted to like this show - a girl forging her path against the cultural grain - except she isn't. It seems Nick does not have the courage to go against gender stereotypes. They take the risk of putting a girl into boys' sports, but then double down on the female stereotype and craft a character that is more of a caricature. They encase her in pink glitter and ridiculous, overdone hair; she is soft-spoken and sweet; she would make Beaver Cleaver a great little wife. Males have reason to be offended by this show as well. The boys are all portrayed as two dimensional idiots who couldn't find their way out of a wet paper bag without Bella."
Bella and the Bulldogs,Sweet,"I love this show, its romcom Im sad that its only so short. It shows a reality of life and how ppl treat women who play football.

I like all the characters also."
Bella and the Bulldogs,As a football player to unreal,"Okay so most people Didn't like it for girl power purposes but as a football player here's the flaws that make it unbuyable and unrealistic 1. She's a QB that has terrible form and throws ducks but is somehow a ""super star"" in the show 2. She's too short to play QB I'm a defensive end the shortest QB I've played was about 5'8 and that was middle school it makes no sense what her play style is supposed to be but that's next 3. Why is she starting: the proud family had an episode like this show but the main character had some skill she was quick but bella isn't fast she doesn't have a big arm and isn't football smart like tom brady, peyton manning etc mainly because the football talk in the show is just bull half the time it makes no sense 4. If you think about she really only played to make a point. Period. Not based off love for the game just a stance"
Bella and the Bulldogs,Incredible!,"Extraordinary show! Impressive storyline, and great plot. I like how this TV program shows that girls can also be a part of a sports team.

I am extremely proud of who thought of this idea! There are lots of great young actors who I really lookup to. I truly look forward to more episodes of this amazing show! What I enjoy most would have to be the story, there aren't very many TV shows like this, these kinds of shows give a message to kids or in this situation girls to show that you can do something no matter what your gender is. Keep up the great work!!! I hope one day to become an actor too.

AR 13 Years Old."
Bella and the Bulldogs,"Jonathan Butler, seems like a remake of his 1st movie.",The Cuckold (2009) Should this guy be doing teens and tweens shows? Many parallels between this show and his movie! Mythological Beast Films is the production company name.
Bella and the Bulldogs,Oh and I forgot to say,The characters in this tv show are supposed to of just turned 13 what parents let there 13 year old wear that much makeup and wear heels to school
Bella and the Bulldogs,Ok but not great,I think it is a nick tv show that can tell kids that if you want to be something you can be it it's just that I don't like how she says she can be s football player but you need to add glitter and make her uniform pink for her to be one
Bella and the Bulldogs,Fun show to watch.,I watch this program because I think Brec Bassinger is one of the most adorable young actresses to come along lately. She was perfectly cast as Bella. She got the role because she could throw a football like a boy. She's the cutest tomboy I've ever seen. She also knows more about sports than most guys. Check it out on You-Tube. I love her voice.
Bella and the Bulldogs,not great....,"I used to love this show when i was younger but now it's just kinda meh, like... this show tries so hard to be a feminist show which would be fine if done correctly but it wasn't, hell.. i'd say that it's more sexist than progressive, but it still gets points for the theme song."
A Call to Spy,An important story,"This succeeds in highlighting the important (and often under-looked) true story of female spies in WWII. I was already familiar with Vera Atkins and Virginia Hall and it was nice to see their stories put to film. It was great learning the heroic story of Noor Inayat Khan too. ""A Call To Spy"" is the kind of film that gets you researching the true events after. More people should know about these women.

As a film itself, it definitely had a TV-movie vibe. The script was rather woeful at times and occasionally the acting came across quite wooden. It still did enough to tell the stories though, while keeping my interest. I would have thought a film depicting the heroic actions of spies in WWII would have more tension and better pacing though.

It felt a bit too long at times, and during the first 20 minutes, I wrestled whether to abandon it entirely. I felt the story of these women deserved my time though, so I persisted and I'm mostly glad I did.

Sarah Megan Thomas delivered a particularly good performance as Virginia Hall. You could easily tell she was passionate about this film and the story of these women. Stana Katic had great chemistry with her too.

A few months ago I watched the reality docuseries ""Churchill's Secret Agents: The New Recruits"", which depicted the SOE in WWII. I highly recommend watching that series before watching this, as it gave a fantastic education and background to the roles of these brave men and women. As a movie? ""A Call To Spy"" is rather lacklustre and has its share of shortcomings. As a story? Everyone should know about it."
A Call to Spy,Very worthwhile historical story,Comentario no disponible
A Call to Spy,Very good subject matter but not a spectacular film.,Good to see the role of women as spies in WWII highlighted here. Am somewhat surprised by the very high ratings given here. It was a good movie but not one you'll be thinking about greatly once the credits have rolled. Possibly this is because the film lacks a truly persistent sense of danger. One would normally expect to encounter several 'on the edge of the seat' scenarios in a film about spies and Nazis and the notorious Klaus Barbie. But this was something I barely experienced throughout. The overall acting was always understated and little more than adequate. It was not bad nor was it terrific. Despite some good production values the lack of intensity is the most obvious deficiency made even more apparent when considering the subject matter. The 7 stars is a generous assessment.
A Call to Spy,Important chapter in WW2 for the Allies.,"This movie, ""A Call To Spy"", is inspired by real events and real allied spies in World War Two. It was the early 1940s, the German Nazi threat was nearing its height, the allies needed to do something bold and surprising. Churchill requested a secret army of attractive female spies be created to conduct sabotage and build resistance in occupied France.

This is the story of those spies and how they were trained, how they went about their missions. The movie is very authentic looking and the mood is just right. The story focuses on Virginia Hall who was a real spy and whom the Nazis considered the most dangerous of all Allied spies. Most of the actors are people I have never heard of which I believe adds to the impact, not being distracted by an actor's fame or prior roles.

Good movie, a nice addition to the WW2 stories. My wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library."
A Call to Spy,Good reconstruction,"Another puzzle under all the second war movies that completes the resistance machinery agains the German Gestapo.

Some British women took important functions to spy out the Nazis in France. It is well done with atmosphere and costumes. If you are Interested in this genre check it out. It was never boring and the actors played their roles very good. Solid 6/10."

A Call to Spy,A little known piece of history... Let's hear it for the Girls!!!,"Enjoyable, based on a true story, film about some amazingly brave and little known WWII heroes...women spies. The acting, although not Oscar worthy, was decent by most. The pace was a bit slow and the editing could have been better, which would have upped the tension a bit, but the film was interesting, informative, and entertaining. (no language or nudity) This underrated, lesser known film held our attention throughout and is worth the watch, IMHO! 6.5 stars - June 2021."
A Call to Spy,A worthwhile call,"The main reason for seeing 'A Call to Spy' was the subject matter, a powerful one made up of the true stories of three inspirational but somewhat overlooked women who worked as spies in the second world war. Being someone who has a thing for promising concepts and bold subject matters. Also like historical dramas, films inspired by or based on true stories and anything centered around spies also intrigues. Not to mention the cast.

'A Call to Spy' was a solid and laudable effort in making the women and their stories known in cinematic terms. It doesn't quite succeed in every area and the women's stories were more powerful than the one that is presented here, but there was also a lot to like about it and it was hard to not admire its good intentions. There was a great film somewhere in 'A Call to Spy', a great one that doesn't quite materialise but has elements of greatness in individual components, but to me it was not a waste of potential.

Like has been said above, 'A Call to Spy' has a lot of good. The best thing about it is the acting, the standout being the committed, determined and heartfelt performance from Sarah Megan Thomas. Stana Katic is a forceful presence too and the chemistry between the two is done with a lot of sincerity and respect. Linus Roache and Radhika Apte bring a lot of dignity to their roles. The rest of the cast are fine, with the enemy being portrayed as genuinely sinister and the film doesn't shy away from showing the horrors of what they did.

It is a good looking film, handsomely and atmospherically shot with a good eye for period detail that doesn't look too clean, the French scenes looking suitably uncompromising. The music has a nice mix of emotions and isn't overused or over-emphasised. The film is directed with a lot of committment and heart, it is easy to tell that the subject meant a lot to the director and all involved. The scripting on the whole is thoughtful and well intended, while the story has enough tension and poignancy (though there could have been more of the former).

Didn't think the storytelling or the film were perfectly executed though. There are too many cliched supporting characters and most of them are given too much short shrift. Khan is rather underdeveloped which is a far cry from the meaty character writing of Hall and Atkins and her fate was actually even more harrowing than presented in the film.

Some of the French dialogue is stilted and there are lulls in pacing where the action is a little too over-deliberate and relies too much on talk. Particularly early on.

Overall, solid effort. 7/10."
A Call to Spy,"Excellent movie. Great story, very moving.",Such a great story and very well told. Main characters have an strong background. The movie is interesting and with moving scenes.
A Call to Spy,"For me, this film fell flat","Usually I enjoy films about agents in occupied France and the two female ones struck a chord with me - I'd read the story of Noor Inayat Khan back in the 1950s. And Vera Atkins and Colonel Buckmaster were intriguing characters.

But ACTS fell very flat and I gave up on it halfway through. As portrayed, all the main characters were colourless and the only one of the cast to make any impression on me was the gendarme questioning Virginia in the cafe!"
A Call to Spy,A missed opportunity considering the history.,"I was looking forward to watch this movie. The story based on true events looked like something really interesting and informative, clearly a story with the potential to make a good movie. But the truth is that they failed to do that, the result is just a slow repetitive story, without any suspense, certainly not with the material they had for this story. The acting wasn't bad but the the plot was. To me it's a missed opportunity to make a good movie about a story that was worth to be told."
A Call to Spy,Great story of heroic people in history!,"How could everyone rate this so little? The actors were amazing, the filming, the script: it was wonderful! Those people gave their lives! More than any of these bad reviewer could give. I loved this movie. It was beautiful! Watch this and don't let the low rating turn you away."
A Call to Spy,Good WW2 movie,"I was interested in this after reading about Nancy Wake, another WW2 spy."
A Call to Spy,Regrettably makes nonsense of the true events,"Having lived through that period in London, whoever was responsible for costumes did no real research. No one in England or France had the new outfits worn by everybody. The actual SOE offices were sparse with minimum furniture and none of the interior design luxury with oil paintings and side lights of an interior design magazine. The attempts to have actors appear to speak French was pathetic. Phone accents with too many 'Bon Chance.' As for the doctor taking someone to lunch, both agents, in occupied France was ludicrous, with wine and chocolates included. The remarkably brave Noor Inayat Khan Died an even worse death in Dachau than conveyed in the movie. And for the truly amazing actual story of Virginia Hall. Do read it up. Extraordinary. Derek"
A Call to Spy,Bravo!!,"Loved the three female leads - each brought a lot of texture and depth to the screen. Also, so grateful to know about these amazing women in WWII! They should be common knowledge - so thank you to the filmmakers for educating us in an entertaining way!! Great movie!!!"
A Call to Spy,Resourceful Female Spy Group,"The British have created a group of female spies, under the request of Churchill, to conduct sabotage and who are passionate for their country and eager not to let the evil NAZI regime succeed. Many of these women are out in the field as well as sending coded messages from headquarters. The movie follows one female spy as she is spying out in the field and doesn't let her wooden leg slow her down and she becomes a notable target of the enemy. People in her sphere are routinely threatened by the Nazis as they are focused on capturing her but they refuse to give up any information about her. How much disruption will she be able to create and for how long? Overall, this was well-acted with quality production sets but left me wanting a bit more tension. It was nice to see another story on how the woman were able to contribute during the war."
A Call to Spy,Falls short,"I love Stana Katic but she can't make this film about the brave female spy's of the SOE better than ""Female Agents"" which has the near identical plot. Here, the main agent Sarah Thomas is heroic beyond words But in ""Female Agents"" Sophie Marceau is just outstanding in her role as the leader of a team dropped into France. I thought ""Female Agent's"" was much grittier, more suspenseful, and satisfying."
A Call to Spy,Great watch great acting,Love a true war story film but the real only mistake I could find was a spelling mistake In the UK we spell Authorised with an S not a Z Great acting from all it has to be said .
A Call to Spy,"Good topic, mediocre film","The storyline was interesting but not exploited enough to make it entertaining. Apart from Linus Roache who is English, all the other main actors had strained and unauthentic English accents that distracted from what was going on. The locations for all of the scenes set in the U.K. were completely unrecognisable and just looked like American actors thinking they were being English in the 1940s on an obvious American film set. A mix of good actors but not in a decent film."
A Call to Spy,"Good performance, well-told story","I was a bit skeptical about Stana Katic being cast in a war film, but I have to say she does a great job in this movie. This is a strong female movie with good casting and very good acting. I personally enjoy historic films and I liked this one."
A Call to Spy,"Like the genre, but mixed execution",Well filmed and solid acting. Plot and dialogues were on the weaker side. Too bad because this was a great subject. I say it's worth a rent if you need something to watch.
A Call to Spy,Unconvincing,Comentario no disponible
A Call to Spy,Gripping Tale.,Just Brilliant. Very enjoyable. Heroes everyone. Great story of true events. Well made film.
A Call to Spy,a very slow take on a chapter of the 2nd world war,"Its a female take on the female operational duties made under the 2 nd world war. its a film about the start and excecution of female operative spies on the allied side, where some of them in cooperation with the resistance organisations had real great importance on the outcome of the war in france.

its a very slow plot, where the actors really speaks slow to make the playtime longer, and where the lack of typical warfare operations and manouvers are absent, i think the reason is to reach out to the female part of the audiences, less violence more viewers, but thats my guessing. its also a lack of information on where things happen, some dates and places are released, but overall what and where we are, are almost absent

what is really well done, are the production design and the very well done location settings to the era were in. also some of the acting are up to date, but none stands out as brilliant. its merely casted with b and c actors, some we've seen in worn out tv series but not many of them. also the direction of extras on the outdoor sets are blemish and not believable, take some rewinds and youll see for yourself.

but its a warhistoric feature film( made on a rigid budget, that tells a story not well known to the public) that everyone should see and learn from. its not extravagant but a recommendable watch thinks the grumpy old man."
A Call to Spy,Decent telling of extraordinary history,"This film is about the actions of three women involved as spies for the British against the Nazis during world war II. What these women did is extraordinary, and it is absolutely right that we commemorate them, but this film doesn't quite do them justice.

The film is written and produced by Sarah Megan Thomas, who also plays the lead, Virginia Hall. Virginia trained as a spy and served behind enemy lines in France despite having a wooden leg. Radhika Apte plays Noor Inayat Khan, a Muslim of Indian descent, who also spied for Britain in France. Stana Katic plays Vera Atkins - the handler working for the Special Operations Executive responsible for female spies.

I was a little familiar with Khan's story as she featured in an episode of Doctor Who, but I can see why Thomas was attracted to telling the story of these otherwise largely forgotten women who risked everything at a time when women were not treated with the same respect as men. At a time when women were not considered able for field work, they led from the front and showed they had the grit and courage to do it well.

Unfortunately, the script simply tries to do too much. Any one of these women would be a worthy subject for a movie but trying to tell all three of their stories at once means none of them get the screen time they deserve. Their stories and their arcs are truncated in a way that is distracting and left me wishing I could see what was going on in between the moments we saw of each of them.

Khan's story is particularly hurt by this. At one point she seems to simply be wandering aimlessly around Paris until she bumps into someone. Surely there was more method to her brand of madness than this?

(On a terribly minor note, it really irks me in a movie when the General or the CEO or the President or whatever appears to have nothing to do but fret and talk about the relatively minor character who is the movies subject. Here, apparently all the Special Operations Executive top brass have to do with their days is talk about Hall and Khan. Come on! At least give them a line where we see they do have other duties!) (Rant over.)

The film looks good. I don't know what the budget was but imagining it was relatively small, Kim Jennings and Vanessa Porter have done a great job of stretching the money to ensure the period details looks right in production design and costumes respectively.

Lydia Dean Pilcher directs competently and efficiently, and lands the emotional beats when she needs to.

I hate to judge the film for what it isn't but I cannot help thinking the material here would have made for a wonderful mini-series, but is simply too much for a films smaller attention real estate.

The kind of Sunday afternoon fare you'd be perfectly happy watching with the parents one rainy Sunday, or perhaps showing to your pre-teen daughter to show her girls have kicked ass in history too."
Love Island USA,Awful,"And I love Love Island UK!! In fact I'm addicted to the UK version! But the American version, which I had a lot of hopes for, is just... depressing. The colors are dark, everyone talks about being ""safe"" instead of the majority of people actually looking to find love like they are on the UK version. It took me a bit to warm up to Ian Sterling's narration from the UK, but the narrator for the US is borrrrring... I'm sorry, but he is. In the UK, Carolyn Flack is a much better host than the girl from the US. The colors need brightened up big Time!! Needs a new host, new narrator and stop telling everyone what they need to do with each new person when they're recoupling!!! Arrrgh! Gets on my nerves!"
Love Island USA,Very boring,Love Island US was so boring! And I feel like the season was so short. There wasn't enough new people that came in the villa to challenge the couples. I feel like US version was missing a lot!
Love Island USA,"Boring and mind numbing, but strangely addicting","Let me preface this with I actually liked the first episode. It was interesting how everyone coupled up, but things got boring fast. None of the conversations had any real substance. I often wondered if it was editing or if they actually did talk over each other as much as it seemed. They are trying to express their thoughts and feelings to their partner and the person that should be listening is also talking! It made it frustrating and impossible to follow and what I did hear was B O R I N G. The reason I stuck with it is because I did feel a tiny bit invested in these couples, but like another reviewer pointed out this show was way to PG for me. Everyone was ridiculously nice. I don't want fake fights or drama, but they were so scared to step on toes. Have none of these people watched The Bachelor shows? I often wondered if it was scripted because everyone used the same vocabulary-referring to each other as boys and girls instead of men and women, asking each other to be boyfriend and girlfriend (smh again with the PG vibe or dare I even say G?). Speaking of vibe, everyone always asking each other if they are vibing with someone. Vibing was way overused. Even when Ariel came out supposedly looking feirce it was more comical than powerful. I hope the step it up for season two and more funny stuff please. Caro vs. the bee in her hair was the best thing that happened on the show. P.S. The hideaway was lame. It was small, horribly decorated for romance, and only two glasses of champagne!?"
Love Island USA,bAAAD baad clipping/editing,"Compared with Love Island UK (which i luuv luuv luuv) the editing of this show is so terrible. The games are barely shown in the episodes, and as a viewer we don´t really get to know the islanders as well as we could. I guess this is just typical american superficial reality... Also, why do they skip the results of the recoupling/ viewers votes to the next episode? SO annoying!"
Love Island USA,Like this is like the worst like,"New drinking game....have a shot evertime you hear ""like""....be an early night and a rough morning."
Love Island USA,"Do they know ANY other word than ""like""","How old are these people? Do they have any other word in their vocabulary than ""like"". Have met more mature three year olds! Sad."
Love Island USA,Totally Binge-worthy BUT...,"I went into this show with little to no expectations and came out really enjoying it for the most part. My absolute favorite part of it is the announcer, who is incredibly hilarious throughout the entire series. He will call out the the cast and production team both with no hesitation, when most announcers sugar coat everything or basically say whatever production wants them too. He's wonderful. The casting is done well too. I found myself really loving most of the cast, with the exception of the ones I just couldn't stand, which makes for great television.

There are some MAJOR downsides however, and all come from the production. There are a couple (not all) cast members that are so overly produced that it's obvious they're playing a character. When they bring in new contestants it's totally random. Sometimes 1 guy. Sometimes 2 guys and a girl. Sometimes 6 people. Also they have these ""challenges"" that are good for absolutely nothing. The winner never actually wins anything. Also during the show some cast get wayyyyy more screen time than others, which isn't fair at all considering how the public votes for which couples they want to stay. An example is the ""random"" dates some of the couple's get to go on. From what I've seen only the fan (or producers) favorites get to go on these dates, in turn getting them more screen time, and more public votes at the end of the day. Most couples don't get these ""random"" dates. Some cast members won't even be seen in some episodes. How are we supposed to vote for someone we forget is there? Another thing is the randomness of the ""Re-Coupling"" as they call it. Who decides the order they get to pick their partners? The answer is the producers. A good example is when a new girl came in and got to pick her partner before most of the other girls, which in turn caused one of the girls that had been there longer to quit. I don't blame her either. She so obviously got screwed over by production. Another small thing, not that big a deal, but production making the cast freak out when they get a text ""I GOT A TEXXXT!!!, is so obviously stolen from The Challenges' ""I GOT A CLUEEEEE!!"" That they would make them do over there. They're way more annoying about it on here, and should tone it down just a tad.

If they could just fine tune some things and make it actually somewhat fair, it would be way better. When new islanders come in, they should alternate. Two guys and a girl, then 2 girls and a guy, so during the coupling ceremony they can also alternate from girls picking, to guys picking instead of girls picking two or three times in a row. Also the winner of the challenge should either be the one that wins the date (and more screen time) and/or decide the order that the islanders get to pick their dates. That's the biggest thing. Make the challenges mean something and let the cast pick the order they get to pick their dates, and alternate from guys to girls at every coupling ceremony. I know the English version is new so hopefully it'll learn from it's mistakes. I mean, Big Brother and Survivor started out shaky but got better so I'm hopeful this will too."
Love Island USA,Stupid & Trashy,"The dumbest blondes, the stupidest tarts, and the trashiest loser guys all meet on Love Island which should really be called Skag Street or Herpes Heaven. These folks make you hope that at the end of the series they are given a lot of money to move out of the USA, and voluntarily seek citizenship somewhere else. Hopefully none of them will ever have children."
Love Island USA,Reality tv,"I never watch reality tv. I literally starting watching this because I wanted something stupid to laugh at. I was super emotionally invested within the first episode.For the people who are saying it's boring... if you're looking for backstabbing, yelling, and general drama, no, you aren't going to like this show."
Love Island USA,"Like, like,like...","Whats up with all the like,like,like? I've ust started watching season 2, i'm in episode 2 now, i've counted all the likes. Its more than tens of thousands. Lmfao"
Love Island USA,Should be called 'Like Island',"""Like do you like like me or like do you like the new girl?""... ""It's like not that like I dont like you because like I do like you, but like..."" Brace yourself, if you plan on watching this show, to hear a whole lot of conversations just like that! I don't even know how these people find the time to actually get to know each other with how much they say the word 'like'. Must take ages. And watching them make out is disgusting. I dont mind a bit of PDA but every kiss is turned into an attempt at a porn audition. Nobody wants to see full on tongues flailing and slobber flying. It's not sexy or passionate it's nasty. In my final thought, the narrator on this US version is dreadfully annoying and not a single bit funny. I wouldn't expect him to live up to Ian from the British version, who is hilarious, but this guy is a complete joke, and I'm not talking about his jokes. I like the British version of Love Island, but we can add this to the long list of British shows that the US attempts to remake that's nowhere near as good.... Shameless, The Office, Skins, Inbetweeners, Outnumbered, Fawlty Towers, even Ex On the Beach, and there's about 100 more.... If you're American like me, but have only seen the US version of these shows you are seriously missing the plot!"
Love Island USA,LOVE LOVE ISLAND,"Honestly usually I hate shows like this because people are so mean to each other, but everyone is super friendly and just trying to find someone to vibe with. I get excited every night to watch it."
Love Island USA,Well.....,First off I'm old enough to be these kids mother. With COVID & no Bach in paradise- I've been watching. Pretty sleezy. But I gave extra stars for the narrator - hilarious. And great job with the music.
Love Island USA,Brainless Morons,"Are twenty somethings really this clinically brain dead? How could people this stupid possibly get a job, hold a job, let alone be able to go to some resort? These mindless idiots have no knowledge of books, films, art, history, politics or anything else that normal people would use in small talk on a date. They appear to be completely uneducated, completely uncultured, massively immature.

An extremely sad and pathetic commentary on the current generation. Disgraceful."
Love Island USA,Never ending,"First I had to endure ""Like...you know...like....repeat"".

Now this show keeps adding more people than it loses. Stop the madness!!!!!"
Love Island USA,The show needs a lot of work and realism,"The editing is absolutely terrible. They show the same boring morning routines and workouts. People pretend to be excited for a text. They have these meaningless conversations and continually say, ""I have a connection with you"". You don't get to see the real parts of people and who they are. And then the parties, challenges, and games are hardly shown. Mostly, the games they are edited and you see like one minute of them. The season is way too long. The number of new people brought in is so random. There are too many recouplings. How can you even get to know and like the couples to vote on them if they aren't going to be in the show after one episode? This could have been a good show if they fixed the editing and actually made the conversations and the people seem more realistic, after all it is called reality tv. The only good part about this show is the narrator."
Love Island USA,Like...,"Like, this is like the dumbest, like most boring, like inane show. Like."
Love Island USA,USA Season 5 - cringey attention seeker alert,Comentario no disponible
Love Island USA,Boring,"As a big fan of the British version of love island I had high standards going into the US version, but just as the US butchered Skins they destroyed love island. Its completely boring and the girls come off ditzy. You can not top Iain as the original narrator. I couldn't stay intrested."
Love Island USA,Enjoyed watching adults behave like adults.,I really liked this show because it wasn't a bunch of fighting and catty behavior. I'm sure some will find it boring but that's because we've gotten so use to such bad behavior from reality TV.
Love Island USA,Not bad but not comparable to UK or AU,"The show has definitely improved since being taken over by Peacock and casting Sarah Hyland. They did a great job aligning the shows production to be more like the UK series

But the problem is the people they select seem to be exceptionally stupid. But shows like this attract stupid people mostly.

However for the UK and Australia, it's far more entertaining. Perhaps it's because they have fancy accents and use the Queens English, but it's a lot more enjoyable to listen to. The US version says ""like"" around 100 times a minute.

It took a while to connect to the characters and the season but half way through you start to really enjoy."
Love Island USA,The Most Inane Show Ever Produced On Network Television,"I can't even think of enough pejorative adjectives to describe this awful show: Vapid. Stupid. Insulting. Boring. Pointless. Stereotyping. Mindless. ... are just a few.

I watched a few minutes of one episode,and I can't believe that CBS wastes money continuing to hype this dumbass show. When I go to my CBS All Access app, I'm greeted with a nauseating huge ad trying to push me to stream the episodes of this horrid production. I would rather swallow glass and gouge my eyes out."
Love Island USA,Fun to watch,"It's a fun show to watch during the summer with friends. You get to root for your favorite couple and even change your opinion on who you want to win. It's not trashy, people gain true bonds with other cast mates."
Love Island USA,Ridiculous Love Show,"Only watched the Netflix one where Zac was featured from Chicago. He was the only one worth watching - the nicest guy proves that midwest guys are much nicer than California guys. He is real, nice, friendly, an average Joe. I don't know if the girl he chose knew what she was getting into though with a grocery store guy from Chicago with a large close family. I doubt it is the life she would be looking for in reality but had no clue what that would be - even mentioning to her mother that he would move to LA. I really doubt that. Other than him, every one else seems so shallow; surprisingly even the cowboy. Have seen better dating shows for sure."

Arrow,Miss the time when it was just felicity Oliver diggil and roy,Team arrow is pretty lame. It's like they went from a show for adolescents and adult to a show for kids
Arrow,Finally Stopped Watching the Show,"After episodes of trying and trying I have fainlly stopped watching Arrow, Left it Midway season 6. Season 1 and 2 of the show were pure GOLD. Season 3 the show got a little sloppy. Season 4 was just terrible. Season 5 went surprisingly good and season 6 is just very boring and and terrible. The show lost its spark after season 3 and Arrow 's new ""team"" is just unbearable. If you compare it with Team Flash. The show lost its Billionaire Playboy Charm and the Dark cool Arrow long back, even Felicity and Diggle are annoying now. It feels like Greg Berlanti just lost his focus from the show. I hope they gain back the Season 1 spark."
Arrow,Still the best of the Arrowverse!,"Arrow is the show that started it all for the CW and the Arrowverse and through all the good (The Flash) to bad (Black Lightning) shows that followed, Arrow is still the best of them. Yes, it had a few down seasons but overall the show was terrific! It tells the story of billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) as he returns a changed man after the world presumed him dead when his yacht sank at sea. He becomes the vigilante Green Arrow and tries to clean up the city. He starts off by himself by slowly puts a team together as they fight to put away criminals in Star City. I can't say enough about Stephen Amell and the job he did. He was perfectly cast as Oliver Queen and is the face (along with Grant Gustin as The Flash) of the entire Arrowverse."
Arrow,Stephen Amell was perfect as Green Arrow!,Arrow is absolutely the best of the CW DC shows (except Smallville). The show had its ups and downs throughout its run but it was still an overall really good show and the last season was one of the best! Stephen Amell was absolutely perfect as Green Arrow/Oliver Queen! I'm really going to miss this show!

Arrow,You have failed this show!,"You have failed this show! The first two seasons were brilliant. -meaningful flashbacks -great villains -good pacing -fitting dark tone

Season 3 had a drop in quality, and season 4 completely butchered a fantastic show. In season 4: -horrible meaningless flashbacks -worse acting -terrible villains -unfitting lighter tone -illogical story lines with many plot holes -more like a soap opera than a superhero/crime drama TV show

-butchering of major story lines like Andy Diggle, Oliver's child, HIVE

Rating for season 1 and 2: 8.7/10 Rating for season 3: 7.5/10 Rating for season 4: 5/10"
Arrow,Bring back the good-ness!,"I used to love this show. When it began, the mere athleticism of Stephen Amell used to give me goosebumps and I would have rated it an 8, even 9. But with the passing of time (I think somewhere around Season 4), the quality of writing started dropping. Actors can do only so much (and they do give their best every time) with this kind of material. Some characters have become sort of hangers on and should be put out of their misery.

I sure hope things pick up in Season 7."

Arrow,Arrow,The Whole story Of the series is very Impressive.I love This show a lot.If you wanna know about Vigilante must watch it.
Arrow,It was a good tour.,"Arrow went in style, and looking back left us both unforgettable seasons and regular seasons, but never all bad. It concludes by giving a good ending to almost all the protagonists that the series had over the years and a sweet ending to the path of Oliver, the creator of the now known Arrowverse"
Arrow,Enjoyable from start to almost finish.,"Without giving away any details, I'm simply going to say that the final 2 seasons were tough to watch. The overall story being told here was fun and exciting and the weaving of past and present was fairly well done. Maybe the final season would have been more enjoyable had it not been crammed into just 10 episodes. It seemed rushed and convoluted and sloppy.

Good acting: Stephen Amell - Oliver David Ramsey - Diggle Emily Bett Rickards - Felicity Paul Blackthorne - Quentin Lance (probably the best performance of the series) Rick Gonzalez - Rene Ramirez

Ok acting: Wila Holland - Thea Colton Hayes - Roy Harper Echo Kellum - Curtis Juliana Harkavay.- Dinah

Terrible awful horrible kill me now acting: Katie Cassidy - Laura Lance Every child actor in the series"
Arrow,"Too much soap, to much failure, too stressful","It was tolerable up to season 4, that's where everyone became emotional extremists and critically irrational for most of the show. There are inconsistencies, events that make no sense, too much hypocrisy from every character who demands respect and honesty but continuously lies and disrespects in every episode. The arrow team plans fail 90 percent of the time making them look incompetent, evil is portrayed as stronger and smarter, while good is portrayed as stupid and weak, the only way to win is by luck and not skill for the arrow team. Really disappointing.

That said, I enjoy the performance of the actors and will continue to watch, even though it feels like I'm sticking needles in my eyes at times with everything this series irritates me with."
Arrow,Good Show Overall,Comentario no disponible
Arrow,This was my favourite Comic Hero show,"The acting is amazing I love The actor who portrays oliver Queen. Also the action in the show is top of the line! Their fight sequences during big boss fights often seem like something from a movie. Very well co-ordinated and the way the camera pans from 1 character fighting to the next and to the next all the while their all in the same big battle is awesome.

If u want action?? This show is for you, the green arrow is always fighting enemies in hand to hand combat which makes it even more enjoyable then other super hero shows.

Maybe sometimes the storyline lags about.. buti for one love what Arrow has done in bringing about a new age of DC shows that intertwine & connect sometimes through Cross over Arcs."
Arrow,A lot of action and great characters,"I don't often watch series from start to end. It has to be somehow special that I take the effort to watch through all the seasons. Usually it starts to feel like a chore at some point.

Going through Arrow took me about four years. First three seasons I watched pretty fast. I think those were the best. Season three ended in a happy note and I was feeling a bit tired of the series already so I decided to quit for some time. Then I watched more seasons from time to time. Especially the later seasons often have episodes that start to bore me. But the thing with Arrow is that there are always those likeable characters and you start to miss them like good friends, so eventually you pop another season.

The dynamic trio is Oliver Queen, Felicity Smoak and John Diggle. These characters are the foundation that always works. But there are also many great supporting characters. If you have read any DC comics in your life you might recognize a lot of familiar characters that visit the show from time to time.

The series starts as a quite simple revenge story where our vigilante is working alone, a bit like Batman. But as the show goes on it slowly changes to a more complex character drama. That works as well because the characters are interesting. But sometimes I felt like I missed the more straightforward action episodes from the early seasons. And some of the villains especially in the later seasons have so crazy schemes that it starts to feel unbelievable even if it's not being a realistic show to start with. I think the writers should have slowed down from time to time because some individual episodes suffer from being just a build-up for some incoming mega plot.

I could talk endlessly about the characters or storylines so I guess that is a sign the series made some impression. It has its weaker moments but overall I don't regret using a lot of hours to go through it."

Arrow,From bad to worse,"Arrow... I was looking forward and waiting this show to start, but from season to season its get more unwatchable... Last season with the kids??? Come on, please make the next season be the final one..."
Arrow,My favorite show ever by far,"Extremely mild spoilers ahead

Season 1: A classic masterpiece with such an amazing and centered cast. I love how the team is so small in this season because it really gives them space and time to show off who they are. The dark Archer is also a fantastic Villain and counterpart To Oliver.

Season 2: Deathstroke is the greatest villain ever and the dynamic between him and Oliver is amazing! The flashbacks are also at their best here as a lot of things from Oliver's past and present connect and intertwine. This is honestly the best season of the show.

Season 3: This is also such a classic and pivotal season as we really start to see Oliver's Relationship with Felicity really kicks off. The show also introduced Ray Palmer who is such a Fantastic Character who's dynamic with everyone is just outstanding. This of course is to set up the second best Arrowverse show: Legends of Tomorrow. The storyline with Ra's al ghul is just amazing and I love the arc with him and Oliver at the end.

Season 4: This is probably the worst season. I personally think it's still really good but the flashbacks are week, the villain feels out of place and the there's this overlapping theme of ""Everyone can be a superhero"" and it's honestly a bit annoying. Overall a decent season.

Season 5: The show really gets reborn as half of the cast is completely new and we get some great storylines with Oliver as mayor. Prometheus is a great Villain and He as well as the return of Deathstroke sets up some great storylines in season 6.

Season 6: This one is pretty week but has some really good storylines as I previously mentioned. The fact that Oliver now has a Son and has to take on the whole role as a Father is an amazing plot as well as Him getting married. This season has a pretty strange set off villains but an amazing crossover!

Season 7: The first half of this season is outstanding with Oliver going to prison. It's an amazing plot and has an amazing ending an payoff. But the rest off the season doesn't really hold up as much and the concept of the Villain is interesting but overall the outcome was pretty boring.

Season 8: An amazing season that connects back to the shows roots and provides a fantastic ending to the show. That's really all I have to say about it.

Overall, an amazing show and I totally recommend it!"
Arrow,The Most Entertaining TV series To Debut In 2012,"With a decent premise (Though hardly original) and good writing punctuated by witty dialogue this series is of exceptional sophistication. The poor quality of small-screen drama has become mystifyingly evident in recent years. A lot of the action in the pilot was also beautifully choreographed.

I read Green Arrow comics as a kid as well as its tie-in The Black Canary. I recognize the names of many of the characters and can see where they might be going plot-wise in future episodes. But they have revamped the back story with a vision that suggests the one Christopher Nolan took in making the Christian Bale Batman movies and I find it quite agreeable.

The future of the show will obviously hinge on public appetite for scripted episodic TV. The evident affection for lame reality show singing/dancing auditions of homely, talentless twits eager to make fools of themselves remains depressingly high. Hopefully this show will find and keep an audience."
Arrow,Protector of Starling City,"Many years ago Oliver Queen known tabloid playboy and perennial feature on page 6 of Starling City's local newspaper has been lost for five years on an uncharted island, the last survivor of yacht that sank. All others are dead including Queen's girlfriend of the moment and his father played by Jamey Sheridan.

Played by Stephen Amell Queen may on the surface look and act like the old playboy, but he's a lot more physically fit and he's got some fighting skills. At night when he's working he becomes the Arrow clad in Robin Hood like Lincoln Green. He who is a child of privilege uses now his fighting skills developed and the billion or three he's got control of to become the people's champion.

Arrow is darker than most comic and cinema superheroes and Amell plays him that way. He's not got any super powers just some highly developed skills.

The show's been on for five years now and it's got good staying power. Amell is a hero, but a most human one. I look forward to its future."

Arrow,Arrow is becoming so boring.,"It's becoming so boring that every bad guy in the series has more brains, more skills and more bravery than Oliver Queen. It has failed the fans making the Arrow a weak, troublesome individual that really anybody can defeat. Start making him more astute, more strong, and wiser than his enemies. The series is plagued with Oliver's failures to succeed. You have a great potential for the series do not waste it on stupid writing. We want to see a strong Arrow not a weak one defeated by everybody. Make him a winner again."
H2O: Just Add Water,Just add water,It's the perfect mixture of teenage cringe and charm. A childhood favorite and a guilty pleasure in adulthood. There's something so pure and enjoyable about this show with it's Aussie aquatic vibe and dumb but lovable characters. It's also quite funny and ironic enough that it doesn't have to be for children only.
H2O: Just Add Water,This show is my guilty pleasure,"I'll admit, it has bad writing and acting a lot of times and it makes no sense but there's certain magic to it, no pun intended. Maybe it's just childhood nostalgia or something, maybe the setting which is Australia, the accents, the silly mid 00s fashion or the fact that it's about average teen girls that happen to be mermaids but it keeps me entertained enough to keep watching. It's kinda trash but that good-entertaining type of trash and that's why it's an 8 in my book."
H2O: Just Add Water,Don't watch season 3,"Fun show, with decent plots, which sadly falls apart completely in the third season."
H2O: Just Add Water,"Genuine fun, in a cute package!","Though I should be embarrassed to say that at 18 I watch a television show marketed for tweens, I'm not. H2O: Just Add Water is quality entertainment.

The storyline, though not entirely lacking in plot holes, is well thought out and attention catching. I've scoured the internet on more than one occasion in the attempts of finding the next episodes and I'm mildly heartbroken about the current state of Season 3. I cannot help but remain interested in whatever might be happening in ""mermaid land"" The acting is certainly not that of Kate Winslet or George Clooney but as far as the small screen goes the skills of the young cast are enviable. Phoebe Tonkin (Cleo), Cariba Heine (Rikki), and Claire Holt (Emma) are the three headliners. They portray their roles as not only mermaids but best friends in a believable and touching way--and manage to convey turmoil in their relationships with each other but significant others as well. We often see Angus McLaren (Lewis) and Burgess Abernethy (Zane) throughout the series and they too are welcome characters. Both portray teens with real personality flaws and remain an area of interest.

Certainly the series isn't without its flaws but it's a cute show that will keep you entertained. I'll definitely continue watching for as long as it runs."

H2O: Just Add Water,WAY Better than SPLASH,"This is the BEST new show I've seen in many years, and I've been watching television since 1966. The effects are superb, the actors are both very attractive and very talented. And the Australian accents make it all the more adorable. ""MERMAID"" just sounds SO much better when it rolls off the tongue of a beautiful Australian actress. You have to watch this show from the start, and give it until season 2 to really hit its stride. It gets very humorous in season 2 - truly a joy to watch. Great for all ages - trust me on this one - i know my mermaids! If this show had an advertising budget behind it it would have been a super smash. Oh and yes I agree - the music is also excellent especially the theme song NO ORDINARY GIRL. I just LOVE this show! If you only watch ONE EPISODE - be sure its SEASON 2 episode 15 IRRESISTIBLE. This is by far the funniest of all the episodes, some of the humor will be lost on you if you haven't seen the prior shows, but it can stand on its own just fine. I'm off to roll around in some ambergris and shamelessly throw myself at the cast..."

H2O: Just Add Water,Brilliant! Stunning!,"This is not just a kids show. One of the biggest reasons I love this show so much is because it involves relationships, friendships, heartache in great depth yet includes no foul language or anything of that sort. The show is well developed from season to season as well as the characters. Some of the quotes are pure genius (if you watch it you will see what I mean) there are some hilarious one-liners and scenes in the show as well as some serious moments, gripping moments, and moments that have made me laugh out loud and cry. The cast is amazing and perfect for their parts - which is pretty rare. The casts acting improves as the seasons go on and the episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Brilliant, stunning, 10/10."

H2O: Just Add Water,The Low Down On H2o just Add Water,"Hey, i am a 13 year old girl and i absolutely love h2o just add water. Its basically about 3 girls named Cleo,Rikki and Emma. When Cleo gets stuck on a boat, Rikki helps her. Gets the boat going picks up Emma and (with the help of Rikki) Get stuck on a island. While trying to get a phone signal Cleo falls down into a cave and Rikki and Emma go down after her. After they walk for a little bit they find a little pool which if they swim underwater would lead them out to the sea. When they get into water they find that the water starts bubbling and sparkling. They don't think anything of it and swim to safety. The next day the girls realize that they have tuned into mermaids. They decide not to tell anyone because they were scared they would end up in a freak show. Later on they find that they have powers over water. Rikki can boil it, Cleo can morph it and Emma can freeze it. While tyring to keep this secret but not let in ruin the lives Cleo decides to go to a party where Zane (The bad boy) throws her in the water while everybody goes inside Lewis (Cleo friends who she likes and he likes her two)is shocked to see her turn into a mermaid he helps and finds out that Emma and Rikki are mermaids to. I have only seen 6 episodes. Because i missed it on channel ten so i am now watching it on the Disney channel. So if you are looking a the show and thinking is this a good show. i would say to you no... Its a GREAT show. And i would definitely recommend you watch it."

H2O: Just Add Water,This is my favorite show :) and it is excellent,"This show has some of the best developed character personalities I have ever seen.If you like shows aimed at pre teens to teens then you will most likely love this show.

The start of the show is kind of confusing but if you keep watching it gets better and better! The plot of the show revolves around three teenage girls that get turned into mermaids.Also how they deal with everyday situations with there new found 'abilities'.

I recommend this show to anyone that likes relationships,mermaids,and just watching one of the best shows ever!.It really is that good, and you will not regret watching it."
H2O: Just Add Water,"The most futile, daft, and heedless television series. A massive disappointment.","In an effort to steal 'Charmed's thunder, Australia went ahead and created something rather diabolically stupid, that it seems almost pointless and a waste of time. H2O Just add water is a television series about three teenage friends who become mermaids, and gradually avoid danger at every turn. Although the three friends must also avoid the greatest danger of all: Themselves. Risking exposure is not a priority that sadly seems very high for them, amongst trying to control their powers. Their powers include the different stages of the H2O cycle, like steam, Ice, and liquidized water. The threats also come from below; other mermaids who want to steal their powers, and their boyfriends... From boat chases to drama both on land and off, H2O just add water promises adventure and spectacle at every turn!

Unfortunately the promise of Mermaids, dazzling special effects, and action, seems to be the only thing on their minds. The script is a childish, contemptible, and the most obtuse, brainless script to have ever been said aloud in quite some time. The dullness of the script is not the only thing that's senselessly nonsensical, but the story-line of each episode is incredibly numb as well as it's cheesy. The dense dialog is so imprudent that the actors performing the inane screen-play look just as stupid. The acting is quite possible the most ludicrous thing about the television series. Here, our protagonists are on the verge of adulthood. Yet, everything that they do – and say – is beyond asinine. We have tweens acting like kids, teens acting like tweens and adults acting like teens. The irrationality of both the script and three girls acting like typical American aussy-speaking teenage girls, along with all of the male figures – all of them – acting like tools and nerds, is utterly absurd and pitiful.

Phoebe Tonkin (Cleo) is probably the poorest actress of the three girls, Cleo, Rikki and Emma. Whilst looking like she's just popped out of a 90's Wes Craven movie, with foul haircuts and the most plain outfits a star could wear, her acting is the most conventional and boring on the show. She's a cynically stupid, easily predictable character who just shut her damned mouth up. Cariba (Rikki) Is perhaps the least appalling actress here, keeping her character a serious and fit one, despite the inferior script. But like everybody else on this show, she does have her stupid moments – yeah, not stupid in the show. Emma (Claire Holt) is just as bad. So, good then. But eager to squeeze his way next to Phoebe as the worst actor on the show (Phoebe later redeemed herself in 'Tomorrow: When the War began) is probably Angus McLaren. He's just annoying, with his incensing presence proving worthless. But that doesn't stop him; Stupid haircuts (they get around, don't they?) feeble acting, floppy dialog, all make him just as weedy as the rest of the cast. An irritating factor is, he seems far too pre-occupied with thinking that he's all sophisticated because he plays a young scientist with the sea-maids, that he doesn't seem to focus on the real issue at hand; the vulnerability of the three mermaids that are apparently his best friends. The exposure of the mermaidians is evidently not a priority; so why even bother with the show? Burgess Abernethy is another male actor throwing away his career. At first he's an untrustworthy 'friend', who as nearly a grown man, is obsessed with mermaids. Again, another pessimistic and juvenile addition. He then proves himself worthy of friendship, and then they all go out for an under-water orgy. This is probably all you need to know. A weakening factor is, he's still a baddie.

Oh no! Now there are bad actors, badly acting, as people acting Bad! Villains and threats are a common factor for our mermaids. Although the villains are nowhere near as menacing as they should be. We might as well kick the show whilst it's down. The theme song 'No Ordinary Girl' written by Shelley Rosenberg is as fatuous as the song, 'I'm a Barbie Girl'. Nail gargling, soul-crushing, head-aching, H2O Just Add Water is promptly the worst television show that has played on afternoon television since 'Power Rangers: Samurai'. Beyond poor."

H2O: Just Add Water,"Oh, Phoebe Tonkin...","So, they can't touch water, right? Up to 60% of a human body is water.

Does that mean they can't touch themselves?"
H2O: Just Add Water,I'm a 39 year old mom and I love this show!,"My daughter (9) and I have watched it in the past and we're enjoying it again. For a series, this is really well put together. Yes, there are some cheesy lines, but the girls do a nice job. They can't help it that they had 2006 era phones! Just enough innocent teen romance to keep it interesting. I wish there were more than three seasons."
H2O: Just Add Water,"Makes my scientific fiction bone happy,",I needed something light and funny and I discovered this. Makes my scientific fiction bone happy. These three teenagers suddenly grew tails and have some powers. Yeah! I'm all in to this. Just started so I'm just saving this page for me to begin this light and fluffy adventure. I like these child centred stories. I can start and drop it when ever I feel like it then pick it up again later. So that is what I am going to do.
H2O: Just Add Water,amazing,"this show is great great effects for a low budget show. stunning underwater photography and amazingly realistic tails make this one of the greatest mermaid media ever created. the show however is not so popular in the us but its incredible popular though out the world showing in over 140 countries/territories and over 200 million viewers of the show a week making huge. with the demand for a new season, a new season will start this October. the beginning is a little bad by not so good acting but good enough and then over a short time they get they're acting great. the show has a lot of twists in the tail(laugh out loud) making it one of my favorite shows ever. i highly recommend this show to anyone who likes magic mermaids for all ages"
H2O: Just Add Water,Nostalgic and I love the gang,"The acting in H2O: Just Add Water may not be top tier and some of the fashion choices reek of the 2000s, but I still hold a special place in my heart for this show.

It's innocent fun, as we watch our girls Cleo, Emma and Rikki navigate their new lives, turning into magical mermaids at the smallest contact with water. The girls' friendship with each other is strong and they are good role-models, but they often fall into mermaid issues - like time-activated sprinklers. Thankfully, they have Lewis (toe nail clipping collector and scientist) to help them when they transform.

Rikki is my favourite character because I think she has the best arc. I really like how one of the episodes explores her embarrassment in her living situation (she lives in a trailer park) and her friends being totally fine and accepting of it. She can't control her family's financial situation and it doesn't make her any worse a person. I am a bit disappointed that we only really got one episode about it, though.

Zane is also an interesting character. He's a pretentious, obnoxious rich kid who gets saved by one of the mer-girls when drowning. He becomes determined to prove the existence of mermaids, seeing himself bullied and considered weird by many others at the juice shack all the kids hang out at (the gang are determined to not be discovered, as they think they will get stuck in a lab). He ends up bonding with Rikki when stuck on a balcony at one of his dad's conferences and we see that his dad is a major influence of his disagreeable behaviour. The two start dating (which Rikki hides from her friends) until Zane is forced to make a choice. He could expose mermaids to the world (including Rikki, who he was not aware was one while dating) or help Cleo, Emma and Rikki escape and remain safe. He helps the mermaids out and we come to see that he is actually quite caring.

I find Emma okay. She's very responsible, but has had to give up her passion for swimming to hide her mermaid powers from the world. Cleo. Is. A. Mopey. Pest. She has been friends with the toe-nail clipper, Lewis, for ages and gets weirdly mopey and controlling about him at points in season 2. She's super whiny and I 100% side with her little sister in all their silly spats.

The series is funny and addictive: I binge watched it for a few days on netflix. However, the third season is a major disappointment. Emma disappears 'to Europe' and is not seen at all, with a new personality-lacking girl in her place (she takes centre stage in the show, despite being very boring). Lewis is hardly seen and Zane and Rikki's relationship just gets really weird. It takes away a lot of enjoyable elements."

H2O: Just Add Water,"Really great show, unique, excellent acting, awesome special effects","I was just channel surfing and my digital box summary for the show read (almost exactly)""The story of three Australian teens that are able to transform into crime-fighting mermaids"".- Crime-fighting mermaids? It sounded like a lame, animated, 7-year-old, kiddie, ""Totally-Spies"" copy television show. So I waited for the commercial break to be over while I was reading the show info. When the show came back, I started watching it. It was the pilot episode (I guess it was the premiere of the show on the channel). It was actually REALLY good. As soon as the episode was over, immediately went on youtube to see if anyone had posted some episodes.-I was NOT gonna wait once a week to watch the show.

I started to watch more on youtube and it was entertaining along with interesting plot lines in each episode.

This show may sound like a girly-bad acting show, but it isn't. The other great thing about the show is that the girls have almost no acting experience on television, yet their acting is believable not overdone at all.

All the special effects look totally realistic, unlike other shows for teens.

Even though I've only seen at least a total of 9 episodes (from both seasons), I strongly recommend this show! I'm not exactly a fan of adventure and fantasy, but I can't stop watching ""H2O: Just Add Water""!

Ordinary People,Just add water,It's the perfect mixture of teenage cringe and charm. A childhood favorite and a guilty pleasure in adulthood. There's something so pure and enjoyable about this show with it's Aussie aquatic vibe and dumb but lovable characters. It's also quite funny and ironic enough that it doesn't have to be for children only.
Ordinary People,This show is my guilty pleasure,"I'll admit, it has bad writing and acting a lot of times and it makes no sense but there's certain magic to it, no pun intended. Maybe it's just childhood nostalgia or something, maybe the setting which is Australia, the accents, the silly mid 00s fashion or the fact that it's about average teen girls that happen to be mermaids but it keeps me entertained enough to keep watching. It's kinda trash but that good-entertaining type of trash and that's why it's an 8 in my book."
Ordinary People,Don't watch season 3,"Fun show, with decent plots, which sadly falls apart completely in the third season."
Ordinary People,"Genuine fun, in a cute package!","Though I should be embarrassed to say that at 18 I watch a television show marketed for tweens, I'm not. H2O: Just Add Water is quality entertainment.

The storyline, though not entirely lacking in plot holes, is well thought out and attention catching. I've scoured the internet on more than one occasion in the attempts of finding the next episodes and I'm mildly heartbroken about the current state of Season 3. I cannot help but remain interested in whatever might be happening in ""mermaid land"" The acting is certainly not that of Kate Winslet or George Clooney but as far as the small screen goes the skills of the young cast are enviable. Phoebe Tonkin (Cleo), Cariba Heine (Rikki), and Claire Holt (Emma) are the three headliners. They portray their roles as not only mermaids but best friends in a believable and touching way--and manage to convey turmoil in their relationships with each other but significant others as well. We often see Angus McLaren (Lewis) and Burgess Abernethy (Zane) throughout the series and they too are welcome characters. Both portray teens with real personality flaws and remain an area of interest.

Certainly the series isn't without its flaws but it's a cute show that will keep you entertained. I'll definitely continue watching for as long as it runs."

Ordinary People,WAY Better than SPLASH,"This is the BEST new show I've seen in many years, and I've been watching television since 1966. The effects are superb, the actors are both very attractive and very talented. And the Australian accents make it all the more adorable. ""MERMAID"" just sounds SO much better when it rolls off the tongue of a beautiful Australian actress. You have to watch this show from the start, and give it until season 2 to really hit its stride. It gets very humorous in season 2 - truly a joy to watch. Great for all ages - trust me on this one - i know my mermaids! If this show had an advertising budget behind it it would have been a super smash. Oh and yes I agree - the music is also excellent especially the theme song NO ORDINARY GIRL. I just LOVE this show! If you only watch ONE EPISODE - be sure its SEASON 2 episode 15 IRRESISTIBLE. This is by far the funniest of all the episodes, some of the humor will be lost on you if you haven't seen the prior shows, but it can stand on its own just fine. I'm off to roll around in some ambergris and shamelessly throw myself at the cast..."

Ordinary People,Brilliant! Stunning!,"This is not just a kids show. One of the biggest reasons I love this show so much is because it involves relationships, friendships, heartache in great depth yet includes no foul language or anything of that sort. The show is well developed from season to season as well as the characters. Some of the quotes are pure genius (if you watch it you will see what I mean) there are some hilarious one-liners and scenes in the show as well as some serious moments, gripping moments, and moments that have made me laugh out loud and cry. The cast is amazing and perfect for their parts - which is pretty rare. The casts acting improves as the seasons go on and the episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Brilliant, stunning, 10/10."

Ordinary People,The Low Down On H2o just Add Water,"Hey, i am a 13 year old girl and i absolutely love h2o just add water. Its basically about 3 girls named Cleo,Rikki and Emma. When Cleo gets stuck on a boat, Rikki helps her. Gets the boat going picks up Emma and (with the help of Rikki) Get stuck on a island. While trying to get a phone signal Cleo falls down into a cave and Rikki and Emma go down after her. After they walk for a little bit they find a little pool which if they swim underwater would lead them out to the sea. When they get into water they find that the water starts bubbling and sparkling. They don't think anything of it and swim to safety. The next day the girls realize that they have tuned into mermaids. They decide not to tell anyone because they were scared they would end up in a freak show. Later on they find that they have powers over water. Rikki can boil it, Cleo can morph it and Emma can freeze it. While tyring to keep this secret but not let in ruin the lives Cleo decides to go to a party where Zane (The bad boy) throws her in the water while everybody goes inside Lewis (Cleo friends who she likes and he likes her two)is shocked to see her turn into a mermaid he helps and finds out that Emma and Rikki are mermaids to. I have only seen 6 episodes. Because i missed it on channel ten so i am now watching it on the Disney channel. So if you are looking a the show and thinking is this a good show. i would say to you no... Its a GREAT show. And i would definitely recommend you watch it."

Ordinary People,This is my favorite show :) and it is excellent,"This show has some of the best developed character personalities I have ever seen.If you like shows aimed at pre teens to teens then you will most likely love this show.

The start of the show is kind of confusing but if you keep watching it gets better and better! The plot of the show revolves around three teenage girls that get turned into mermaids.Also how they deal with everyday situations with there new found 'abilities'.

I recommend this show to anyone that likes relationships,mermaids,and just watching one of the best shows ever!.It really is that good, and you will not regret watching it."
Ordinary People,"The most futile, daft, and heedless television series. A massive disappointment.","In an effort to steal 'Charmed's thunder, Australia went ahead and created something rather diabolically stupid, that it seems almost pointless and a waste of time. H2O Just add water is a television series about three teenage friends who become mermaids, and gradually avoid danger at every turn. Although the three friends must also avoid the greatest danger of all: Themselves. Risking exposure is not a priority that sadly seems very high for them, amongst trying to control their powers. Their powers include the different stages of the H2O cycle, like steam, Ice, and liquidized water. The threats also come from below; other mermaids who want to steal their powers, and their boyfriends... From boat chases to drama both on land and off, H2O just add water promises adventure and spectacle at every turn!

Unfortunately the promise of Mermaids, dazzling special effects, and action, seems to be the only thing on their minds. The script is a childish, contemptible, and the most obtuse, brainless script to have ever been said aloud in quite some time. The dullness of the script is not the only thing that's senselessly nonsensical, but the story-line of each episode is incredibly numb as well as it's cheesy. The dense dialog is so imprudent that the actors performing the inane screen-play look just as stupid. The acting is quite possible the most ludicrous thing about the television series. Here, our protagonists are on the verge of adulthood. Yet, everything that they do – and say – is beyond asinine. We have tweens acting like kids, teens acting like tweens and adults acting like teens. The irrationality of both the script and three girls acting like typical American aussy-speaking teenage girls, along with all of the male figures – all of them – acting like tools and nerds, is utterly absurd and pitiful.

Phoebe Tonkin (Cleo) is probably the poorest actress of the three girls, Cleo, Rikki and Emma. Whilst looking like she's just popped out of a 90's Wes Craven movie, with foul haircuts and the most plain outfits a star could wear, her acting is the most conventional and boring on the show. She's a cynically stupid, easily predictable character who just shut her damned mouth up. Cariba (Rikki) Is perhaps the least appalling actress here, keeping her character a serious and fit one, despite the inferior script. But like everybody else on this show, she does have her stupid moments – yeah, not stupid in the show. Emma (Claire Holt) is just as bad. So, good then. But eager to squeeze his way next to Phoebe as the worst actor on the show (Phoebe later redeemed herself in 'Tomorrow: When the War began) is probably Angus McLaren. He's just annoying, with his incensing presence proving worthless. But that doesn't stop him; Stupid haircuts (they get around, don't they?) feeble acting, floppy dialog, all make him just as weedy as the rest of the cast. An irritating factor is, he seems far too pre-occupied with thinking that he's all sophisticated because he plays a young scientist with the sea-maids, that he doesn't seem to focus on the real issue at hand; the vulnerability of the three mermaids that are apparently his best friends. The exposure of the mermaidians is evidently not a priority; so why even bother with the show? Burgess Abernethy is another male actor throwing away his career. At first he's an untrustworthy 'friend', who as nearly a grown man, is obsessed with mermaids. Again, another pessimistic and juvenile addition. He then proves himself worthy of friendship, and then they all go out for an under-water orgy. This is probably all you need to know. A weakening factor is, he's still a baddie.

End of the Road,pffft....,"TRYING to disregard all the obvious social ""messages"" in this...

This was decent for the first half, act one. Where they are merely building characters.

Catalyst happens, act two....

If you have half a brain you INSTANTLY know who ""Mr Cross"" (The bad guy) is. Because of this, act two feels more like going through the motions. The repeated ""mystery"" behind Mr Cross is somewhat pointless because you will probably already know who it is.

The reveal, act three....

From here.. It's exceptionally fitting that Ludacris is starring in this film... because it all gets so very, very, very, ludicrous. It almost borders on an unintentional comedy. There are too many logic errors to list - wild leaps that wouldn't really be possible.

All the acting was good, the constant unnatural lighting was an odd choice... purple, orange, green, pink.... never just normal lights. Made it visually more interesting.

Overall it was an okay watch, but don't really expect too much.

Regarding the ""propaganda"" aspect.....

I would say the ""message"" here of exceptional bigotry by white characters is not really a good message for younger audiences. Portraying all white people as racist is no different than portraying all black people as pimp, hookers, or murderous drug dealers --- it's simply not true. Ya can't paint things with such a broad brush. While I don't deny bigotry exists.. I've never seen it to the extent expressed later in this film. And to be perfectly honest, I think it worked pretty well in act one of this film when it first rears its ugly head. However, all the usage after that scene was pointless and didn't add to the story in ANY way.

I honestly wonder if these films which portray such bold, in-your-face, clearly defined, racism are not teaching mechanisms for younger viewers. And while this film avoided any white character using the N word.. it got as close as possible without it. So are they somehow showing younger white viewers what's ""okay"" in terms of how white people think of and act towards black people?? There's no subtlety in this film, no nuance - which is most commonly what actual racism looks like today. And there are no consequences for the racism, no pushback by other white characters.... it's simply portrayed as ""that's what all white people think."""

End of the Road,Dodgy script and direction make a dud film,"Another example of a need to churn out films at a fast rate for an eager audience. Netflix is rushing out way too many films and risking the reputations of actors by doing so.

The lead actors must have been quite misguided to take this project as they are way better than the resulting film produced here. A mishmash of a road trip type movie we've all seen before but redone in a shoddy way.

Not even a hint of realism as the story progresses but the writers must shoulder the blame for that and the Director surely could see what was resulting from the bad writing. Take more time on the scripts please!!!

Give it a watch if you like Queen Latifah and Ludicris but don't expect their finest work."
End of the Road,"Yes, this is the end of the road - LOL","Everything is mediocre in this movie. Script, acting, photography, director, production design, etc. Typical lefthanded copy-paste of the worst kind. And what's up with the purple lighting? Is it so not to make the movie too scary? Don't worry. There's nothing scary about this movie. The acting and how the scenes are composed together are so untrustworthy that you won't feel scared, ever! Only every two minutes you will be wondering why you are still watching?! And that's a kind of scary feeling. The producers should have taken the same actors and the same script (maybe a different director?!) and made a Comedy. That might have worked."

When I say satire I mean all the actors characters seem to be a mockery of clueless white people and it just gets worse from there. In first 5 mins you'll figure out what's happening.

End of the Road,Oh Luda.....You cant need the money this bad.,"I really really tried with this one because of the number of actors that have decent names. I even ignored the very very repetitive r@cism tropes. I still struggled with the off button. But I did make it to the end. Just!

It was very tired old/ old fashioned. Very repetitive. Poorly over acted. And weirdly directed.

The slow increase of purple lighting made me think old horror movies. Very odd. It felt like the director was trying to portray it as a dream where the whole thing is a story of a black womans struggle to have a better life with white people constantly holding her back...but the movie wasnt done well enough to leave that impression.

The ""baddy"" was super obvious from the very beginning. Bit of a waste.

I have liked Luda for decades and hes also acted in decent stuff but LUDA..what you thinking?

Queen Latifa seems to be portrayed as a super athletic bad ass recently but I genuinely dont see what producers see. There are hundreds of black women that could portray a bad ass and make it more believable. Her close up fight scenes look very dated and only used because she isnt an athletic bad ass.

The scene where she not only takes out a muscle bound ex UFC fighter with very few blows but she also takes out a whole gang of r@cist drug dealers made me pick up the remote to finally go to turn it off..but I thought NOPE, I shall finish this like the hero I am.

And what is it with every white person being r@cist? I mean I get having white people as baddies but do they all have to be r@cist baddies.lol... The r@cism was strong with this one, mostly not very subtle at all. Even Ludas character was a r@cist cliché.

But a black female director who has spent god knows how many years behind the camera obviously has a story to tell..But these heavy handed messages with a weak story isnt the way to get the message out. Its bores people. Just read the terrible reviews. They missed the smaller subtle messages in this movie because they were busy rolling their eyes with the big loud r@cist tropes.

There were subtle micro aggressions that were excellent but then BOOM..a massive r@cist bomb ruins the whole thing.

I absolutely genuinely think """"R@CISM"""" is a new movie genre..like slashers were in the 1980s.

Watch if really bored and dont know all white people are r@cist.."
End of the Road,WHITE PEOPLE ARE EVIL!,"Or at least the people behind this movie think so. I'd say the most evil white person is the dude listed in the credits as a writer, the dialogue in this film is bad. I'm sorry to undersell it, it's not just bad it's dang near terrible but the film doesn't seem to know it. It feels like the director wanted a serious film but the writer wanted hobo with a shotgun and the movie could have been great if it would have committed one way or the other. And look I freaking love Queen Latifah, her Chris and Beau are the reason I watched this movie but man did they get done dirty with this weird half woke half assed script. Yet they still gave it there all. I will say on a positive note the low budget cinematography is really pretty rad and some gems are hidden throughout the movie it's not all bad. I'd recommend watching it just don't go in thinking it's as serious as the trailer made it seem and you'll enjoy it a lot more."

End of the Road,It was fun!,"The reviewers here are a bunch of kill-joys! Sure the movie was formulaic and corny but I enjoyed the role reversals and the plot twists. Queen Latifah played her signature ""don't-mess-with-me"" character of Brenda very well. Ludacris played a somewhat misdirected Uncle Reggie and Mychala Lee and Shaun Dixon were great and believable as loving, supportive kids. I even enjoyed Beau Bridges and Frances Lee McCain as badasses. When I elected to watch this movie I wasn't expecting an Academy Award performance from any of them. Nor was I expecting a superlative script. Jeez people! Lighten up! Was it a great movie? No. Was it enjoyable? I think so."

After giving their statement to the police, the family continues onward but eventually Brenda receives a phone call angrily demanding money and Brenda learns that Reggie took a bag of money from the hotel room intent on using it to help the family get a fresh start. Meanwhile Arizona State Trooper Captain JD Hammers (Beau Bridges) tries to find the Freeman's believing the altercation at the motel may be linked to ruthless and enigmatic drug lord Mr. Cross.

End of the Road is the latest genre film from Netflix and comes to us from seasoned screenwriter David Loughery and first-time feature director Millicent Shelton who has previously worked extensively in TV and music videos. Shelton had stated her intention with the film was into tapping into the social status of Black Americans and using a traditional thriller setup to convey that. The movie is pretty familiar in its structure and is reminiscent of those cookie cutter thrillers Screen Gems such as No Good Deed, Obsessed, The Perfect Man or The Intruder that take time tested thriller concepts you remember from the genre's boon in the mid-90s and use them as low to mid budget vehicles for established black leads such as Idris Elba, Morris Chestnut, or Michael Ealy. The film is well trodden ground for screenwriter Loughery who has penned a number of those kinds of thrillers including Lakeview Terrace, Obsessed, and The Intruder and while those movies aren't groundbreaking, there is a sort of silly charm you get from them especially when you watch them opening day in the theater in a packed house with a lot of that audience energy making for a fun time as their reactions are often as much a part of the experience as the movie itself. While it is a little disappointing not to have the option of seeing this movie in a packed house, this is slightly above average in quality in comparison to some of those other examples and the film features solid likable leads and strong direction by Shelton who shows solid handling of simple material in her first time helming a feature.

The movie makes no secret of what it is as the movie only clocks in at about 82 minutes not including credits and it uses that time efficiently as we're introduced to the characters and situation effectively establishing everyone in the family and giving us some solid and surprisingly likable character moments with some of the interactions between the family such as conversations in the car or horseplay in the hotel room making the characters endearing enough they could've sustained a film even without the ""money in a bag"" thriller setup we end up with. Queen Latifah is really good as Brenda and she sells the role as a determined but very sad mother and you do root for her as a protagonist. Chris Bridges is also very good as Brenda's brother Reggie who's positioned as being a screwup, but a well meaning one who does try and with the best of intentions. I also though Mychala Lee and Shaun Dixon were quite good as the kids and while kids in these kind of thriller films can sometimes become grating, I felt Loughery did enough to sidestep that pitfall and make them kind of endearing if not particularly substantive.

Now I will say this movie is pretty familiar territory with most of the beats of the plot not deviating all that far from the established norm right down to the fact that the faceless ""Mr. Cross"" character is positioned as a reveal, and you know pretty much from the first time a character is introduced that you think ""that guy did it!"" and you'll be right. The movie doesn't have much in the way of surprises, but it's rollercoaster entertainment that keeps things fast, tense, and relentless with some sequences of tension such as a confrontation with two peckerwoods or the motel sequence being points where your breathing will stop and wonder ""what's going to happen?"". We also get some really memorable night shots with Shelton bathing the scenes in a violet light that gives those shots a unique visual identity and is a welcome change from many thrillers that often use the dark as a cost saving measure and you can only view vague silhouettes of what's going on rather than enjoy the action.

I enjoyed End of the Road for what it was, a well made quick thriller that kept me invested and didn't overstay its welcome. Both Latifah and Bridges are really good in the movie, and Shelton shows a strong handling of the material that does make me think she has a future as a reliable genre director. On a side note I was appreciative of the fact this movie went for an R-Rating when many Screen Gems movies often go for a PG-13 and make this kind of film feel like a ""movie of the week"" you should be watching on Lifetime or TNT so that also helps elevate it a bit more than your typical genre piece."
End of the Road,Really???,"I rely heavily on IMDb reviews to help me choose what I watch. It's the first thing I check when my husband suggests a movie, and for the most part, IMDb user reviews seem to get it right for me. But apparently this is new out today, and there were no reviews yet for it, so I had no reason to tell my husband no when he suggested it! We went in blind but I'm m not sure we're going to make it to the end. My daughter complains that I don't like anything, so I tried to give it a proper go, but I'm sorry, this one is just ridiculous. Unbelievable plot, unbelievable characters, stupid script and a wasted Beau Bridges."

End of the Road,To Racially Charged,"This reminded me of a racist cops and robbers movie from the 70's with roles of races switched to accommodate a new era in bad theater and hatefulness being sewn through scripts in Hollywood these days. The weak plot is not the biggest disappointment. It was not bad acting. It is the predictable characters and the obvious cliches. Writers tried too hard to make decent one liners. They came out poorly timed and not funny.

I think that the saving grace for this film and why I was able to give it more than one star was the young actor Shaun Dixon. He earned the other stars for my rating. He was awesome and you can tell he worked hard in the role. I look forward to seeing him in future movies.

It could have been a much better movie had it not try so hard to be racist. It was almost cartoonish. So unnecessary and unwanted in this country's current atmosphere."
End of the Road,An alright film for weekend viewing,"End of the road was just an alright film. It did have a twist which I really didn't expect in the slightest. The acting was good. One thing I kept asking though, is WHY was there purple neon lights everywhere? Wherever the family went, it was if they were in a massive greenhouse under purple grow lights almost the entire time, is this normal for the part of the US they're in? Movie uses the ""All yt people are evil"" trope but that's probably how that area of the US is so I'm not surprised it wasn't scared to be geographically accurate. The ending seemed a bit deus ex machina though. Was just an okay film for the weekend viewing."

End of the Road,A cheesy b*movie with a tired scipt,"Not really sure why this film is generating so much racist hatred. Perhaps people should live lives like others before understanding.

It is a formulated script. It's mundane and not the best. There's some nice action sequences. The Nazis are hilarious. The over-acting is frustrating.

It's just another popcorn road movie about a struggling family who tries to do well. It's not that fresh but it does have important political messages like BLM and white hate friction. Funny seeing ""tough"" nazis being beaten-up.

Sadly due to the average plot and lacklustre stor line it's an average movie at best. Some nice dolly sequences on the cars. Solid camera direction. The positive message and nice cinema sequences just about gives it a six from me."
End of the Road,"Boring, Long Winded, Stupid","This is a terrible movie. An hour and a half wasted. All the white people were bad. All the black people tried to be good people. I mean, forget the stupidity of social politics. It doesn't matter what color anyone is. They should've killed people who were trying to kill them. Good job trying to take the high road when people are trying to kill you. That's not reality. But again, reality isn't even reality anymore. This movie is awful. It's not worth watching. I'd rather watch Morbius and that was pretty terrible too, but not as terrible as this movie. Go watch something more fun like Minions."
End of the Road,"Great movie, ignore the low ratings.","This was a great movie. It had lots of action , amazing performance from Queen Latifah (like always). I just don't understand what people want these days from a movie. It's a movie, it's entertaining, it's got a story,a great twist and I enjoyed it.

So give it a chance and watch it's it's nothing new,but it's worth a watch. At least one. Ok, the Low ratings? I don't understand them.

What exactly are people asking from a movie? I've seen a few boring movies that have a rating above 6. This one is not boring, it's got what it needs. Entertainment.

I would definitely recommend and will recommend to my friends."
End of the Road,Not bad,"Here's a low budget thriller that never manages to overly excite or thrill, but isn't a total turkey either.

The story is about a family that after losing the man of the family have to move house to a different state, but en-route, they run into some serious trouble and lives become at stake. I like the simple nature of this story and it could have been a very tense, nail biting thriller, but it is let down by the several flaws it has. Firstly and most relevantly is that the characters make some seriously bad decisions, which cause a bit of unrealism.

There's also some shockingly fight scenes that could have been plucked from a comedy.

Another issue was the obvious use of Green Screens. I'm not sure why they even needed them in a film essentially shot mostly in a car. If i can see when it's a green screen, i tend to not be impressed. Also how come that everyone seems to take all the events in their stride, are they used to things like this happening to their family, because in the real world most people would get serious PTSD from their bad luck.

Putting all that aside, it's still an ok movie, with a pretty good script and some good acting on Latifah's part, (not so much from Beau Bridges, who's got the Hammy-meter all the way up to max).

Oh and there's a really cool twist too towards the end which i wasn't expecting, so bonus points for that.

Sadly, as enjoyable this was in places, because of the several poor elements, i can only score this 6 out of 10."

Fate: The Winx Saga,Angsty teens with powers,"First off, pros, beautiful cinematography and a captivating storyline. Second, cons, angsty teens with powers run around causing havoc and just being annoying."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Worth a watch,"Definitely worth a watch, but the writers made the main character so incredibly insufferable it's almost hard to watch. She's rude and overly-aggressive and so thick-headed it almost made me stop watching the show all together. The way she insults anyone who disagrees with her or won't give her what she wants is almost comical, no one ever puts her in her place and it's infuriating. Hopefully, a season 2 will have some better writing for character development."
Fate: The Winx Saga,[6.5] Welcome to the Winx magical circus,"A series with mostly average acting, terrible writing, laughable development and just some nice VFX and heart-warming teenish score!

It's so unbelievably bad and shallow that green-lighting a second season of that nonsense is just laughable, while brilliant series get cancelled after the first one.

Be sure that the same acrobatic circus and total nonsense will repeat in season 2."
Fate: The Winx Saga,The acting is bad but bloom was worse.,"The movie itself isn't bad but the acting needs improvement. I was annoyed the entire time because they made every single episode and seen revolve around Bloom. I found that to just be biased and undeserving because she literally thought that she was the shxt. I hated how self absorbed she was. There are other actors in the film, you can elaborate on their story as well. Bloom is worn out and just point blank annoying. For the next season shift focus please. I literally kept rolling my eyes everytime I heard her name or she spoke, annoyed I tell ya. She needs to be parked and understand that not everything is about her."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Mas as bad as I thought,"I was expecting this to be a bad adaptation, I ended up really liking it, was definitely not expecting it to be good but it actually is. It's very different form the original show and that can be seen in the trailers, the trailers were bad for my taste. I recommend you giving it a try just like I did, maybe you'll enjoy it."
Fate: The Winx Saga,It's alrightttt,"I enjoy the show, the storyline is interesting. The only thing that really bothers me is the age of the characters? Like why are the characters 16-17 years old having sex in school, smoking and drinking? I know the show is fairies and fantasy but that part is just really unrealistic and disturbing.

Other than that i really enjoy the show. Its for people that love Charmed, The Magicians and the umbrella academy.

The main character is kind of explosive and all over the place given she's only 16 in the show, it makes sense but the over dramatics is sometimes unnecessary. Love how each character had their own distinct personality and the show keeps me wondering whats going to happen!"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Give Fate a Chance,Comentario no disponible
Fate: The Winx Saga,The show has a great potencial,"Being honest, I expected more of the show honestly, but that doesn't make the show bad, quite the contrary, I really enjoyed it. It resembles very much, the vampire diaries but unfortunately not winx. I loved the cast and their chemistry but I didn't like the fact they cut Tecna and Flora out. I think the show should have at least nine episodes not six 'cause I found the story a little messy but not in a bad way. You should watch it with an open mind because the show has the potencial to be better and improve in a possible second season. Yes, I missed the song and the shiny things but at the final episode we have what we wanted most (you know what). Remember the show can improve and get better. I really waited for so long to watch a live-action winx show and if gets cancelled I would be so disappointed."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Honestly way better then I expected and leaves me wanting to know what happens next,With seeing all the previous reviews with the trailer I thought this show would have been bad. What people rlly need to see is that this show is not winx it is solely based on the original show. The storyline of this show is amazing and by the last episode it leaves you wanting to know what happens next. I agree that they should'nt have cut out flora and Tecna out of the show and casted better with some of the main characters. But it makes up for it when u watch the show and the girls have great chemistry. I was also mad that Stella didn't have Brandon. Besides all that the show has GREAT potential to be amazing and I think people should give it a chance. You never know they may add in flora and Tecna in the later seasons. I rlly hope this show doesn't get cancelled because by the last episode everything just got real interesting.
Fate: The Winx Saga,Fate has potential,"It's based on a concept but it's a separate show. It certainly is more grown up and ""edgy"". The writing at times is cringey. Time passes too fast and the connection between the leads feels forced and not really genuine. The character's depths aren't really explored and Bloom's backstory is also weirdly set-up. After finishing the season you don't really have the feeling that anything that important happened. The plot is rather bland and rushed over. I still think that the show can stand well on its own and I'm looking forward to see more of how they explore this potential in future seasons."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Basic teen drama + magic,"There's a very simple world concept, not dissimilar to harry potter, or sabrina with a few different rules. There's some angsty teens hot for each other. That's about it."

Fate: The Winx Saga,"Dull, boring mediocre","Not a lot to be said about this show. Characters are blah and story is boring, really drags its heels. Very little chemistry between the cast and very little to keep you focused."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Good possibilities,"I've never seen the cartoon version so can't compare. The storyline and characters are interesting and different to most other shows and there's great potential here which I hope is seen in season 2. The main problems are Bloom and (to a slightly lesser extent), Sky. Bllom is a petulant, bratty teenager and Sky is meant to be a hero warrior but all he seems to do is moon over girls! I really hope they improve their attitude and characters next season."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Very Enjoyable.,"I'm not sure what people think they are going to be watching when clicking on play. I find this show entertaining,the story, the cast and effects are all engaging. Yes its very CW but let's be real its based on a cartoon about fairies that came out years ago. I personally hope it gets a season 3. I didn't really watch the cartoon. I'm a bit old for that but I went into this knowing it was YA and involved fairies going to a school and learning magic. Keep your expectations, at the very least, realistic based on the source material and you may just find yourself enjoying it. I just finished Season 2 and found myself quite attached to some of the characters."
Fate: The Winx Saga,The Real Fairies of Otherworld,"A group of 25-30 year old actors play 16 year olds at a fairy school. The characters are broadly drawn, the smart one, the sarcastic one, the sexy evil one etc. Bloom, the lead has discovered irony and is basically a bossy biotch that I never really cheered for. That all being said, I did like it. It was clever enough to keep me watching and the writing has its moments. For mindless entertainment it hits the mark and I'd watch Season 2."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Need more episodes !!!,Comentario no disponible
Fate: The Winx Saga,Worth a watch,"I started watching this because I wanted to know what everyone was talking about and I don't regret it. Had it not gotten such a hype (just on my socials) then I wouldn't have given it a go. It's very easy to watch and you don't have to think much. I thought episode 6 really took it up a notch with adult themes and I liked that, made it feel less ""high school"" and more mature. I'm hooked in enough to watch season 2!"
Fate: The Winx Saga,Bloom is a stuck-up immature and ungrateful airhead.,"Pathetic acting. And none of the students look 16-17. I don't know their real ages, but they look like they are having mid life crisis. The most annoying character is probably the lead, Bloom. She is ungrateful to her friends and she just thinks about herself. She impulsively takes stupid decisions and puts everyone in danger. Her friends are dumb enough to not know how selfish she is being. If I was her roommate, I'd have smacked the narcissism out of her. On one side, we had Harry Potter who also wanted to get to know his parents but he wasn't a dumb, stuck-up Dolt like Bloom."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Loved it,I really loved it and the season finale is killing me. I pray for a second season
Fate: The Winx Saga,"I enjoyed it, but I never watched the original...","I did enjoy this show. The second season did get a little too campy/teen, but I think a lot of the reviewers are being a bit harsh on Bloom. I definitely have to say that whoever did the costumes/styling for EVERYONE except the Specialists uniforms, should be FIRED! Half of the outfits didn't even look like they fit the actors... pants too big, pants too long, shirts too tight or not tight enough... just about everything in Stella's wardrobe was TRASH and very out of character for a royal -- especially one that mocked Terra's outfits. And don't even get me started on Aisha's wardrobe... Ok, I feel better now that I got that off my chest.

In short, it was an entertaining show if you don't take it too seriously."
Fate: The Winx Saga,Definitely created for the girls,"Watched this with my wife over the past week or so, and it's not too horrible, but there are definitely plot holes and biases. Pretty obvious they made this with a young female demographic in mind. All kinds of diversity on the female casting side, yet the guys are a pretty homogenous set of pretty boys that like to pretend to be strong.

They did their best to fuse a bunch of concepts together. For instance, magic is supposed to manifest around puberty, but they want the school to feel like college, so they compromised and they're all ""16"", but look 25. They wanted to fuse fantasy elements with modern world, so they have cell phones and military vehicles, but somehow no guns of any kind. M2 would seriously wreck house and I've got to think that'd take the spotlight away from their magical special effects.

Our lead tries to exercise some reasoning to accelerate the story past ""naive protagonist stumbles through whatever"" but she somehow gets satisfied with only one round of analysis without weighting long-standing bias. For instance, if you implicitly trust a mentor character, and that mentor character has decades of grudge against whatever, how do you not take any precautionary steps to respect that mentor?

No spoilers, but I took a star for the haphazard manner the season finale was handled. Pretty much gives them a mulligan on, well, everything in season one, which is extremely lazy writing."

Norsemen,This show! Is! Too much! Man!,"Seriously though. Best show currently on television. At first, I thought it was another cartoon for adults only with poor drawings. But it's not. It's different. For one, the jokes are funnier and the sads are sadder. The first season starts out more of a plain funny show, but beware this show will break your heart if you stick with it. It is also a really clever show - I'm sure that I'm not smart enough to catch all the references but sometimes I get the jokes and that feels good. Also, this show may be one of the depictions of depression on TV and movies ever."

Norsemen,The story of a horse that changed my life,"The story of a horse that changed my life. Yes Bojack Horseman is simply something more than an animation series about animals and humans living together, not that it is much bigger than that. At first, I strongly objected to the evaluation of the first episode of Bojack, which scored 7.1, man. What is that? I watched it four times and laughed the same amount each time. Anyway, let's start the review. The first season was hugely funny and intelligent, but nothing was measured by the rest of the seasons. The series starts from the second season and reaches its climax in the third and continues to evolve until the last episode that will leave you feeling a great emptiness around you after you finish this great show Bojack is one of my top 10 so I won't talk more than that. One of the few offers that deserves a high rating. My rating 9.8"
Norsemen,The Real Real,"Listen here, I am going to be the most straight up and ask myself these questions, and try to answer them: What is Bojack Horseman?

What does it mean?

What does it try to reflect?

Why does it feel so real?

I'll tell you in one word: because it is REAL. As real can get..

It's every miserable dark corner of everyone's life that all of us is just too upset or tiny to talk about. It is the real real, showing every ugly and every petty, showing that we are just a piece of dust in this universe which is billions of years older than us, that we are meaningless and mostly little nothings, but we all want to be worth something...

It is made as an animated 'cartoon' in which animals are like people, dumb jokes top even dumber jokes and it is goofy, but just to get the inner child out of you to keep you hooked, but if you are left believing that its just a goofy dumb show, then it is not for you and please leave it alone..it is life, human nature, a never ending art. And for you others, brothers, we are all Bojack Horseman's and you just need to let it go..try not to think about it. Live your life, be happy with stupid stuff, maybe find the love of your life.. just stay happy and loyal to the most importants. I love you:) And for the creators and masterminds behind the show, thank you so so much, you have my full attention, you answered a lot of questions that I could never find the answers for.. just thank you:)"
Norsemen,A Rare Experience,"I don't usually write reviews for shows, nor have I ever written about anything on IMDb before, but I felt as if I should after watching this show.

It's hard to put into words the way I felt about watching BoJack Horseman. Sure, it starts out as a comedy with seemingly no real plot. Sometimes it just seems stupid, yet still comes off as possibly a new, interesting yet also run-of-the-mill animated series, but it starts to develop into something more. Something that I think a lot of people may or may not fully see to the end of the first season because they decided the show wasn't for them. And that might still be true. But I can't help but feel some form of disappointment. Why? I don't really know. I guess I just foolishly want everyone to get something out of it.

I don't think anything, whether it's a book, a movie, a game, or even a show deserves a 10. But sometimes, for just a brief instant, you stop caring about how you want to quantify how much you like something and just want to express how much you enjoyed it. That to me is the only way I can really describe BoJack Horseman. I can't say it's good, or bad, or even average. It's just a show that wants to get its point across, whether it's original or not. And it does it in a way that's hard to look at critically.

And at the risk of sounding like I'm contradicting everything I've already tried to say, I almost don't want the show to have a new season. Not because I hate it or think it's ""too good"" to continue on, but because it already feels complete. I obviously don't feel bad that the series has already been renewed for a second season. And even if it happened to only be a two season series, I'd still be thrilled. It's just that in some way, I hope it doesn't change.

So even though most likely no one will be reading this review (which is actually more like a reflection of how I felt about the show rather than a genuine examination), I at least hope that more people will try watching it and get some enjoyment out of it. Even if it's only for one episode. Who knows? I might even look back at it and wonder what I was thinking, or why I wrote a frankly pointless review about it.

But that's alright. Because in the moment, it was something memorable."
Norsemen,Netflix has made a cartoon for the ages!,"BoJack Horseman is what modern Family Guy wishes it could be and then some; it's a black-comedy-drama show that looks into the life of a washed up television actor who's struggling to find happiness in his life and ultimately remains unsuccessful in achieving that. Who'd have thought a cartoon about an anthropomorphic horse would end up being one of the deepest things currently on television? I'm genuinely surprised by what this show had to offer for me the first time I watched it. The first season's initial half is a little slow, but from then on BoJack transcends into a wacky comedy-drama that is one of the bravest shows to confront the issues of depression, anxiety, loneliness and nostalgia.

I love this show. I can hardly fault it for anything besides the initially-slow premiere episodes, which I still reckon are great entertainment in and of themselves. This is a show that rewards your patience and loyalty to it ten-fold.

Netflix's animation achievement gets 5/5 stars."
Norsemen,The best adult animated show,"Who would have thought that a show about an anthropomorphic horse set in Hollywood would be one of the most human shows ever made. That was what Raphael Bob-Waksberg managed with BoJack Horseman. It's a show that's hilarious and dramatic, satirical and tragic as we follow BoJack Horseman and his friends through the trials of life. The show could be nilhilistic and the characters could be prophetic about their own destinies *couch* Sarah-Lynn *couch.* BoJack Horseman offers up on the best portraits on issues like mental health and addiction and doesn't sugarcoat anything. This makes the show so relatable and lets it stand out."
Norsemen,An animated show that feels more real than most live-action series.,"Netflix, in their continuing mission to provide premium content to their subscribers, has another hit on their hands with BoJack Horseman. I had some reservations before watching the first episode, because there hasn't been a great new animated series in several years now. But with such a great cast on board, I figured it was worth a try. So glad I did, because it ended up being the best original comedy I have seen in a while, animated or otherwise.

It does not take long at all to get wrapped up in the story of BoJack, a has-been actor known for his role as a single dad in a popular early '90s sitcom. Having not acted in the 18 years since the show was canceled, he agrees to pen a memoir in an effort to relaunch his career. When confronted with the reality of how he is perceived by others, BoJack becomes desperate for acceptance and redemption from both the public and his inner circle.

For the most part, people from normal walks of life are portrayed as humans, while the elite class like actors and their agents are portrayed as animals. It's a surprisingly effective method to humanize these characters to whom the common person does not easily relate. Will Arnett, Kristen Schaaf, Aaron Paul, and Amy Sedaris all give their characters a 3-dimensional quality that is difficult to achieve in a 2D platform like animation. It helps that it is wonderfully drawn, with many subtleties that reinforce each character's persona.

Instead of a loosely assembled pile of anecdotal stories with characters that are just given a reason to exist, all the events during each episode contribute to the progress of the plot over the course of the first season. With episodes picking up exactly where the last one left off, the show feels more like a 3-act mini series than a TV show. That said, there are plenty of crass jokes and innuendo that will satisfy viewers who are not vested in the overall story.

I am delighted that the series has been picked up for a second season and to see in what direction the story of BoJack and his inner circle takes us."
Norsemen,Excellent,"One of the best things to ever come from Netflix, BoJack Horseman is excellent. The characters feel extremely real. They are flawed, but learn and grow as the show progresses. More people need to watch this showz"
Norsemen,A really good show,"The thing with BoJack Horseman is that it takes a couple of episodes to find its stride and those first couple of episodes have caused many a person to stop watching. It's a shame, because it ends up being really great, with moments that are poignant and sad and really sort of grab you in a way you don't expect.

Every actor is terrific, the animation is good, it's just an all around great show. It's not quite quite Archer, but then what is, you know? I loved this and ended up watching the entire series in one sitting which is a shame because I have nothing to look forward to until / if they go for a second season."

Norsemen,Depressing Apathy toward Life,"Beyond the inside jokes and meta-humor best suited to the writers themselves than a mainstream audience (this is a Netflix series after all), this show reveals the nihilism that has grabbed hold of Hollywood and our vain, materialistic culture. What do you expect, when everything from promiscuity to profanity, from drug addiction to backstabbing, is now the norm?

The show tries to push some kind of moral struggle through the main character, who is toxic to his own relationships but tries to do good nonetheless. And yet, whatever accomplishments he makes in this struggle don't seem to matter much in the context of this mean and indifferent world that the writers have created for him to inhabit.

Forget about the strange phenomenon of humans coexisting with what are basically humans with animal heads. What kind of fictional animated world is this, where career women feel guilty for having natural human emotions, where friends threaten to kill each other (for laughs), and where rappers make music videos about how violence perpetrated against the defenseless unborn is ""cool"" and ""hardcore""? Not to mention where characters often seem lost in nostalgia, as if to imply that the present world has turned into a hellhole of abandonment and despair. (It kind of has.) But if Bojack Horseman is trying to be as profound as so many critics say it is, why keep dwelling on the negatives of modern life instead of making an effort to show how things ought to be? Being realistic and ""down to earth"" only gets you so far unless you can build a constructive message from it, and Horseman's fatal flaw is its refusal to tackle real human problems seriously. It pretends to, but its quick diversion to flat gags and standard sitcom resolutions can only mean that it has no real answers for us. It's a sad sight, in all honesty."
Norsemen,A Surprisingly Entertaining Series,"Like the incessant influx of superhero films currently pervading Hollywood, ""adult"" animation has become a genre that borders upon an overstayed welcome. As a result, my personal expectations for the Netflix original series ""BoJack Horseman"" were not particularly high, but I do like to keep an open mind. Much to my delight, the series provides humor, drama, well-written and connected story lines as well as solid character development. BoJack is simultaneously a disdainful but overall likable character performed wonderfully by Will Arnett. He is joined by a fabulous cast of characters / voice actors that instantly bring this show to the level of other modern animated successes such as Bob's Burgers. In fact, I could absolutely have pictured H. Jon Benjamin as BoJack, but he already seems to lend his voice talents to so many different areas. The series also provides a fairly original artistic presentation as the characters almost resemble a painted portrayal at times. The show is not only humorous, but also covers subjects such as unrequited love, self-loathing, substance abuse, betrayal, and other more serious concerns that really serve to draw the viewer into the series. Overall, ""BoJack Horseman"" is an incredibly impressive entry into the burgeoning repertoire of successful Netflix original programming and I hope to see this series continue for years to come."
Norsemen,Every episode is a truck load of emotions and you will require Therapy,"Okay, I know there are not much Bojack fans around here. I even tried recommending this show to a lot of my close friends. But they couldn't make it past few episodes. Well the answer to that is, even the actors mentioned during various interviews, that you gotta binge watch this show. I binged it like crazy and I was left with nothing but emotional hollowness all around me. Every ending of an episode led me to contemplate about life. And then there were episodes which made me go all teary eyed. All the people who loved this show is because deep down all of us are Bojack Horseman.. Someone please give this show a Golden GLobe!!"
Norsemen,Superb dark comedy,"In a world populated by both people and anthropomorphic animals, Bojack Horseman (voiced by Arrested Development and SNL's Will Arnett) follows the life of the titular horse, a former sitcom star. Bojack isn't the best person and has a lot of emotional and mental issues. I loved this show and consider it one of the best adult animated programs of all time.

This dark comedy is an excellent analysis of human nature, mental health, and the question of redemption. Be prepared that Bojack really does some awful things, though the show wisely paces them out. Yet, the show also manages to make you feel for Bojack. To clarify, the show never validates his actions. In fact, there is self-criticism of the its own anti-hero genre. The writing, characterization, and use of continuity in this show is EXCELLENT.

Though the last paragraph makes this sound super dramatic, there's plenty of comedy and it's really, really funny. There is some really cutting satire of Hollywood and showbusiness. The show does a good job of balancing the darker aspects with lighter stuff. Bojack's goofy, carefree longtime house guest Todd (Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul) is a great balance with his wacky misadventures.

Also, this is that rare show that never drops a beat. All six seasons are quality, including the last one whose cancellation was sudden.

I can't recommend this enough. This show is pure genius."
Norsemen,Wow.,"Now that the show is over, I need to shout a big thank you to the it and all the people that made it happen. Just, just that.

Thank you."
Norsemen,One of the best adult animated shows I've ever seen.,"While the first season wasn't fully developed in it's characters and situations, I still enjoyed it very much, and had developed a bit of an emotional attachment during the last 3-4 episodes. But nothing could have ever prepared me for seasons 2 and 3, which offered some of the most poignant insights into celebrity culture and the nature of depression for a multitude of characters, which had by the time become grounded in their own right, I have EVER witnessed.

I can't even put my thoughts into words for this review because I love this show so much, which is very surprising, I try to stay as formal as possible. I won't spoil anything, but there was a few different episodes in the past 2 seasons that made me cry, scream, hate, love, everything. This is really one of the few animated shows I can think of that brings on pure, unaltered moments of absolute emotion from the deep dark places of my soul. I connected in ways I never would have thought possible to Bojack, as well as a few other characters in the show. This is a must watch for anybody and everybody, you just have to get past the first half of the first season to truly start to love it.

Oh, and the show is also outstandingly funny. Worthwhile as a comedy alone."
Norsemen,"Not only the best cartoon ever, but one of the best TV shows ever created","When I began this series, I had absolutely no clue how incredible it would prove to be. I was a fan of adult cartoons before seeing BoJack, I initially expected it to be one of those shows with some funny moments and occasional good messages, however upon viewing, my mind was completely blown. It was first recommended to me by a friend and I saw a few episodes, I thought it was okay but not amazing, but later on the new season (at the time) came out and he recommended it to me again, I picked up where I left off and after a couple more episodes, I was entirely hooked. Never before had I seen such hard-hitting, heartbreaking, emotional topics handled so elegantly, whilst still consistently achieving hilarious humor. In my opinion, BoJack is the second best TV show ever to exist (the first being Breaking Bad) and I 100% stand by BoJack as being the best show on Netflix, way better than the pathetic excuses for shows like 'Paradise PD' and 'Big Mouth'. I recommend this show to the moon and back, but get the tissues at the ready."
Norsemen,A Masterpiece,"I don't know why I took so long to watch this one, it had been recommended to me to plenty of times for the last few years. This became my favorite adult animated show. Rick and Morty is good with the subjects of nihilism and it has it's depiction of self destructive depression but it doesn't get it quite as right as BoJack Horseman. Every form of depression is presented in this show and they're presented in such an accurate way, I had tears in my eyes watching a talking horse go through similar situations I have been in. In some ways I relate to BoJack but I saw myself more in the characters of Diane and Princess Caroline. That's the beauty of this show, every character is relatable in some way but the way they've been written is so natural, it's not a forced depiction of the various damaged type of folks that exist in society.

The character development in this show is phenomenal. We see BoJack's ongoing struggle with depression, trying really hard to be a better person but falling back into his toxic patterns. Every season he digs himself into a deeper hole because he refuses to fix himself, because he believes he can't be fixed - this is present in the character of Diane as well but her forms of self sabotage are more subtle. Different forms of depression are shown from substance abuse to self delusion and they're all presented in the most accurate way. I love the episodes where we get into the heads of BoJack, Diane, and Princess Caroline. We see how BoJack has an ongoing battle in his head going from positives to absolute negatives, he tries to have self love but it immediately transitions to self hatred. Diane can't forget the hurt she faced in her early years, constantly hearing her father and school bullies talking her down. Princess Caroline helps herself feel better by imagining her grandchild talk about her successes in the future. The way these moments are shown, even the style of animation they choose to present these moments, it's just a brilliant work of art altogether.

The show definitely has its many moments of humor, this is a comedy after all. Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter provide the comic relief although they have their deep moments as well, but the show does an incredible job of showing you that although these characters may appear stupid, they're actually the happiest people in the entire series. Both of them have their tough moments but they both rise out of their problems better than the other characters because they're happy. I love that they have BoJack admit to Mr. Peanutbutter that the main reason he does not like to be around him is because he envies him for his happiness, that was such a powerful moment. I hadn't seen a moment that powerful in a film or series in so long and I didn't expect to see it in a show about a talking depressed has-been horse.

Honestly I can go on and on about how amazed I am with this show. I can even write an entire essay about how this show properly depicts mental illness. As someone who still battles with depression here and there, I felt completely understood with this show. Finally someone got it right and it was a show in a universe where talking animals cohabitate with humans. I will rewatch this many more times. It's a show that knew when it was time to end and connected every single story they told until the very end. The writing in this show, to all the writers out there that want to tell great stories on screen or even in a book, watch this show and take notes.

I love BoJack Horseman, thank you the team that brought this show to life. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm an eternally grateful to know this show exists and understood my pain in a way I never thought any form of media could completely understand - in a way I had not felt since Amy Winehouse released Back to Black. Highly recommend this show, you will not regret it. It's a masterpiece."
Norsemen,Colourful psychedelic journey through the dark night of the soul.,"I started watching Bo Jack when I was 17 years old. I am now 23. This show grew in depth and maturity as I did. The way that it captures the darkness and ugliness of life, while also celebrating in its wild crazy unpredictability, is like nothing else. While I struggled with purpose, meaning, mental health, drugs and the rich expanse of life that is sometimes so difficult, I felt I could relate to Bo Jack Horseman. It is a very honest portrayal of many things. And a very, very, gloriously silly way to do it. I grew with these characters. There is something profound about this. This piece of art, that I know will never be done again. The attention and care and genius that is here, is worth celebrating. Thank you for Bo Jack Horseman"
Norsemen,Imaginative,"Wow. Bojack Horseman is an amazing show with fascinating episodes that are creative and unique for TV today. It deals with deep and complex characters and faces so many issues with a refreshing style. Some episodes are incredibly emotional and extremely immersive. However, I felt the earlier seasons were not as good as the later seasons - my personal favourite being season 4 as the main storyline dealt with a complicated, depressing issue in a breathtaking way. Bojack Horseman is not the funniest show, there are plenty of chuckles though. Overall this show was amazing with great writing and was something so different to everything else I have seen."
Norsemen,"Starts off nice, but gets old fast...","BoJack Horseman has a nice premise (and some clever characters), but the show's sad scenes, and plots are tarnished by the fact the almost every episode ends with a few sad scenes (the show loses it's sense of emotional attachment). That also creates a very repetitive feel. .... ......"

The Good Bandit,Worthwhile and Funny.,"It is a great comedy, but it also has great message to all. It shows how people can change and be good."
The Good Bandit,A Spanish Telenovela with French Farce Flavor,"It's good to see that some of the streaming sites are investing in a ""new"" genre of Telenovelas, that are almost satires for the genre itself. This is one such offering from Colombia, the other is ""House of Flowers"" from Mexico. The Spanish spoken is difficult to understand (and usually Colombian Spanish is one of the more grammatical and easily understood varieties) but a lot of street slang is used that is specific to Colombia so that makes it hard at times. I guess this is to add authenticity to the character roles. Overall, it's funny enough to keep you watching, and the characters are weird enough to keep the viewer engaged.

Unfortunately, as with many of the Colombian Telenovelas, this one goes on for too long, and loses it's satirical edge, becoming more like a standard silly Telenovela, replete with a lot of crying, sickly sweet background music that drowns out voices, and thoroughly spoiled children whose bad behavior seems to be celebrated rather than corrected. That is not a recipe for success in the global market, and something that the creators of this series will need to address if they wish to have their series taken seriously on a global streaming platform."
The Good Bandit,I loved it!,The best comedy series in a long time. Gosh I miss Colombia
The Good Bandit,A good one,"So good I saw it twice. It has humor, love, drama and action. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
The Good Bandit,Excellent Show,This show is beyond words. It has almost everything. The acting is so good. One of the best shows on Netflix. It is a must see binge watch that you will never forget for any honest person.
The Good Bandit,This is Schitts Creek funny,"Rich powerful guy tries to make it right by doing the right thing with the help of his loyal lovable wise guys and his Patron Saint, St. Judas . 60 plus 45 minute episodes. It's binge watching nirvana."

Breaking Bad,Really Great,"I have never watched a show that is as consistently genuine and engaging as Breaking Bad. This is undoubtedly one of the greatest shows ever, and it consistently improves as it progresses.

The Journeys of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are unforgettable. These are some of the best-written characters to ever come from a pen-hitting paper.

My praises for the acting and cinematography are unending. Some of the shots are intricate works of art, and I was rarely distracted by the acting. The performances are excellent to the extent that it feels improper to refer to them as performances.

Overall, Breaking Bad consistently maintains a level of engagement and technical quality seen in only the best of movies, and in terms of tone, every intense moment is executed with excellence and always achieves the impact it reaches for.

I feel like the show's plot in the early seasons lacks a certain level of complexity due to it not having a vast amount of plot threads, and the start is a bit slow-paced, but Breaking Bad is an absolute must-watch. If you have mixed feelings towards Season 1, trust me, it is only uphill from there.

If there was ever a series you could call perfect, I think this might be it."
Breaking Bad,It's ok I guess,Re-Watched it 7 times and counting. I guess I liked it.
Breaking Bad,99.1% pure,"One of the greatest shows ever, the pacing is excellent. The characters are well developed and entertaining. The show ties everything together very neatly. It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."
Breaking Bad,The Best,I cannot stress enough how good this show is. I've watched a lot of TV in my life and this show still remains the best show I've ever seen.
Breaking Bad,Damn near perfect!,"Breaking Bad is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the greatest tv shows ever created...it's damn near perfect! I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google ""greatest tv shows of all-time"" and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!"
Breaking Bad,Those days ain't gonna come back..,When you finish the show you'll never be the same..I guarantee you
Breaking Bad,Best TV show ever made.,I wanna delete my brain and watch it again like I never knew it.
Breaking Bad,Absolutely Brilliant!!,Breaking Bad is every bit as good as everyone says it is. It's easily one of my favorites shows of all-time and one of the best shows in the history of television. Just read through the reviews and look at the 9.5 rating to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. I love this show so much that I've already watched it all the way through twice already and plan on doing so again sometime in the near future. There's nothing more I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just go watch it. But plan ahead to give yourself enough time because you're going to want to binge this as quickly as you can. It's addicting once you start!

Breaking Bad,Among the best and most addictive shows there is,"'Breaking Bad' is one of the most popular rated shows on IMDb, is one of those rarities where every season has either been very positively received or near-universally acclaimed critically and where all of my friends have said nothing but great things about.

Very few shows in recent memory had me so hooked from the very start that before the week was over the whole show had been watched, especially when for a lot of shows now airing watching one episode all the way through can be an endeavour. 'Breaking Bad' had that effect on me, and its reputation as one of the best, consistently brilliant and most addictive shows in many years (maybe even ever) is more than deserved in my eyes. Its weakest season is perhaps the first season, understandable as any show's first season is the one where things are still settling.

Actually everything is established remarkably from the very start, but once the writing and characterisation becomes even meatier the show reaches even higher levels.

Visually, 'Breaking Bad' is one of those shows that is both stylish and beautiful, with photography and editing that are cinematic quality and put a lot of films today to shame, where there are a lot of visually beautiful ones but also some painfully amateurish looking ones. The music always has the appropriate mood, never too intrusive, never too muted.

The writing for 'Breaking Bad' is a fine example to all shows of how to have a lot of style but also to have a lot of substance. The dialogue throughout is thought-provoking and tense, while also have a darkly wicked sense of humour and heart-tugging pathos. The stories are texturally rich, intimate, tense and layered, with the pace of them consistently deliberate but taut. The direction couldn't be better.

Can't say anything bad about the acting. Bryan Cranston is phenomenal as one of the most fascinating anti-heroes, or even of any kind of character, in either film or television. Aaron Paul has never been better and Anna Gunn is affecting. The characters are compelling in their realism.

Overall, describing it as brilliant doesn't do 'Breaking Bad' justice. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Breaking Bad,My Review For The Best TV Show Ever,"In 29/9 and same time this Date is Final Episode Day ( Filena ) This is The Best Tv Show I have ever had season one a little slow like season two and season three but seasons four, Season Five Was Perfect Very Good Character have in this TV Show Like Walter White, Giancarlo Esposito, Mike, Hank And Jesse I Love All Of Them What'a Story Breaking Bad in My Heart And Stay in My Brain Forever I Will Miss This Tv Show Coming Soon But The Good Point is I'm not saw Better Call Saul Next Up is Better Call Saul I'm Happy to See The Best TV Show Ever This Date For My Is Very Special 29 9 2024 At 5:30AM I Awake To Watch Filena Final Episode Thank You Breaking Bad I Love You."
Breaking Bad,Too dark for my taste,The plot line is great... the acting is good... it has all the makings for a great show but for me it was just so dark and depressing I can't call it a favorite.
Breaking Bad,Soulless TV,"This show is missing a soul: a beating heart below the surface.

At first glance BB seemed pretty cool to me, but after a while everything started feeling out of place; the funny moments are just uncomfortable. The storyline, which could've been exciting, completely loses all tension within the first episode; quite an achievement! The family scenes with great comic potential never work out because everyone is behaving like psychopaths. I mean, none of the characters in Seinfeld are particularly pleasant and yet they make for good viewing, because they actually respond to their environment in a manner that we can relate to. The violence felt all wrong too. I like my gore (Braindead) as much as the next guy, but it needs to intensify the experience of the story; in BB it's just giving people something to gross out on to prevent them from realizing that nothing important is really happening (Game of Thrones anyone?).

The fact that so many people lose their mind over this show worries me a bit. Then again, I suppose every generation gets the TV show it deserves. We live in confusing times. The good news is that people want to be entertained by something as different as Breaking Bad. The bad news is that what they're excited by is so hollow."
Breaking Bad,"If you mix Scarface, Robin Hood and maybe Tyler Durden with enough meth - you'll get a mean cocktail called 'Heisenberg'","If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.

The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).

For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic."
Breaking Bad,Once in a life time series,"I have never watched any series which depicts emotions so exactly through camera angles, dialogues, screen play, perfect story line other than ""Breaking Bad"". We all are lucky enough to be born to watch series like this. Teaches us loyalty, family love, pain and many more things.

More than anything this series teaches people to live life the different way and changes people mindset towarss life.

There are scenes which will stay with you forever after this series and it will change the way you watch TV Series and life for that matter.

I don't think I will ever see any series which will be better than this.

Perfection!"
Breaking Bad,By far the greatest show I've ever watched,"Breaking Bad feels like fever dream. A really REALLY good fever dream. The directing is absolutely perfect. The characters bounce off each other in this really well done way. I can really feel the true emotion and pure character coming from each one. I can feel the greed, lust, money hunger animals each of these characters are. There are no true heroes in this story (except hank I love u)."
Breaking Bad,in a category all on its own.,"Nothing compares. Nothing comes close.

I may currently be on my 20th dose of this show and it's still as addictive and beautiful as the first time."
Breaking Bad,"Since GOT is over, this is Officially the Greatest show ever made","I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.

Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.

Thank you for existing."

Breaking Bad,The 10/10 show.,"If there is any show deserves a 10/10, it's Breaking Bad, Simply the greatest."
Breaking Bad,A Masterpiece for sure.,"I usually don't comment on here but this show is the best I've seen in my life. And I've seen a lot of shows. The setting, character development and the actors... everything is pitch perfect. I'm on my fourth run through this show and I still love it. There's no other show out there I can watch this many times and still be excited. The dynamic between Walter and Jesse is awesome. I will watch this show once a year and I never get bored. Forget about the hyped shows you'll only watch once. This is the one and only you should watch right now If you haven't already. The only show that got me this excited in the last decade was Dark.

Just look at the rating for breaking bad and you'll know what's up. Not many shows can hold up this rating for so long."
Breaking Bad,Slightly overrated but definitely good,"Ok, so while it isn't quite the holy grail it's made out to be, 'Breaking Bad' is a solid series. I give it a concrete 7. It is well worth watching. It absolutely IS a good series. Just allow for a steady stream of implausible moments throughout the series where various story points just aren't remotely believable. Enjoy the good (there is plenty), and look over the ludicrous (there is plenty). Enjoy the show."
Breaking Bad,Painfully boring,The story is interesting and well developed but the pace is too slow. There are too many unnecessary scenes and filler episodes.
Breaking Bad,Stunning Comedy-Drama,"I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week!

10/10

Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!"
The House of Flowers,,
Versailles,"Monsieur, Alexander Vlahos stole the show","Forget about the sun King Louis XIV, this show introduces us to his eccentric, fabulous, incredibly smart brother often under the shadow of the sun. The actor perfectly delivered the emotional dimension, complexity of the character, and I couldn't help but be a fan. I also ended up searching historical facts about Philippe, what a truly interesting character he was! Alexander Vlahos deserved a grammy for this."
Versailles,For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue.,"For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue. Absolutely love this show. Visually rich and very nice attention to detail and character development. Great acting in general but no doubt props going to George Blagden as Louis XIV (who is also amazing in Viking another epic show) and Alexander Vlahos as Philippe (a very great character analysis).

This show reminds me a bit of The Tudors with Jonathan R Meyers but so far much better about pacing and accuracy.

I seriously want three maybe more of Louis XIV and hope they continue with other rulers i.e Louis XV aka Beloved and Louis XVI with Marie Antoinette. Seriously need more shows like this. History is far more interesting than made of stuff half the time.

Great job cast and crew."
Versailles,Louis - Mon amour!,"Yet another fantastic TV-series that makes me want to learn more about history. I thank the creators of this for making me more curious about what really happened. Very beautiful and well acted.

I have binge-watched this twice in three days, so I think I can offer my opinion. It is very good TV!

Blagden and Vlahos perform excellently; the plot is very much about two brothers, a new and fresh angle of the Sun King I haven't seen before. It is also about building a home, a palace, and also about building a country.

I doubt a proper historian would approve, but I don't mind. This is good TV and I like it a lot.

Since I already googled the crap out of Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans, I guess I have made my point. This made me learn a bit more about this era, and also see how it influences the oligarchy in our present time.

Very well crafted entertainment - I recommend you watch it at least twice. That way you will get to know the characters better. Season two? Can't wait!"
Versailles,A feast for the eyes,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for a series to come along that I look forward to each episode. This is it. Absolutely gorgeous, stunning settings, costumes and sets.

The actors are fascinating. I don't care if it is minute by minute historically accurate as I can read a history book about Versailles and life there, but this is super interesting as a drama within that palace and time frame. Everyone is just so real. They are horrible, loving, scheming, nasty, lavish, flamboyant, crafty and violent, but isn't that what real life and humans are all about? I am loving the costumes, jewels, food, florals, decor and art.

Fingers crossed for Season 2."
Versailles,Opulent and Addictive,"We do not expect historical accuracy from a series featuring French royalty. Rather, we expect opulence, much action and intrigue, with a fair amount of sex and decadence. Well, Versailles has that in spades, and not knowing much about the France of that period, I am taking much of it with a pinch of salt, but I think this is really good television.

The plot meanders a bit at times, and of course Louis was building his nation, and at times Versailles seems more important than his country, but of course it represents France and all that we associate with it most splendidly, even today.

Beyond the nation building, Louis had to deal with a troublesome group of noblemen who seemed to spend all their time plotting against him and killing off people to whom he was attached. No wonder the poor French got rid of their royalty eventually, it must have seemed very troublesome to those whose lives were harder and less important.

It is superb television and I think the scriptwriters can take real credit for building a series where Louis plays members of his court (and even his own family) off against each other with skill and aplomb. He was clearly born to be a king.

This is great TV and I can't wait for Series 2 which I am told is in the pipeline.

Mary Gumsley"
Versailles,Addictive viewing,"One of those shows it took me some time to get round to watching, but after binge watching Series 1 I have to say it is excellent viewing, I'll agree with other reviewers who highlight there are very definitely historical inaccuracies, the birth of the Queen's baby etc, but they can be overlooked, as the drama is somehow addictive. It is very raunchy, lots of sex scenes, and lots of gay sex scenes, shock horror.

The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish, you cannot helped but be wowed by the sheer majesty of the buildings and surroundings, The Palace of Versailles itself almost takes on the role of an extra character, it's so impressive. It is visually always on the money, the filming, music etc, are first rate, utterly faultless.

I'm so glad they chose not to put on dodgy French accents, so often spoil historical dramas.

George Blagden is an outstanding lead actor, he looks so incredibly different in costume, I think he's wonderful in the role, masses of charisma. So well matched is Alexander Vlahos, who plays his brother, totally suited to the part, fair to say he adds masses of variety to the show.

Great to see that Series 3 has been commissioned, meaning plenty of Versailles to come. Great show. 8/10"
Versailles,More than just your average costume drama,"This drama is about the rise of Louis xiv, the Sun King, Louis the Great, who moved the executive from Paris, the centre of the known world to Versailles, a great bog.

With his father long dead, his mother recently dead, he was alone except for his brother and those he trusted. His political marriage to a Spanish princess was not happy.

He is primarily concerned with how to rule a growing French Empire. This French court evolved into something strange - where dancing and etiquette were critical politically.

Versailles,"A feast for the eyes and ears, without a doubt!","A feast for the eyes and ears, without a doubt! A great and pleasant surprise. Excellent and promising players! A series that are worth seeing, tells the story of the French King Louis XIV known as the Sun King of the 17th century, a king, smart handler, subtle, and your affectionate relationship but complicated with his brother Philippe, his court of friends and enemies, the conspiracies and interests, their lovers and its unwavering decision to build the famous and beautiful Palace of Versailles. Not being a documentary on the life of the King, the main idea is there and very well written and represented, with scenarios, clothing and spectacular dialogs. Congratulations to all of you, to the team of Versailles. I look forward to season 2 :-)"
Versailles,A long way from the truth....,"Versailles is yet another example of revisionist history that paints a misleading picture of the life and politics of Louis XIV, known as the Sun King.

This drama presents the young French King as an astute, visionary. Much of the narrative is used to make the King sound clever, by having those around him make transparently stupid observations. My favourite is his head of internal security congratulating the King on signing a peace treaty, saying ""the war has ended"". Its an implausibly absurd comment, given the same head of security is surrounded, at that moment, by men killed as a result of what amounts to a domestic war between the King and elements of the nobility. A war he, as head of internal security, is personally charged with fighting.

The reality of Louis XIV is a lot less glamorous. A parasitic individual, who could only sustain his extravagance through rather ugly acts of domestic usury, theft, international conquest and imperialism. That's not to say Louis was any worse than his contemporaries but, to try to portray him in such an overstated and flattering light, makes a lie of historical truth.

Versailles was hardly the pristine, architectural marvel, its presented as either. People defecated and urinated in hallways, diseases, especially of the venereal variety, were rife. The nobility populating the hallways and rooms of this palace, were not the nice, clean, well scrubbed types presented in this series. They were a dirty lot, who washed infrequently and disguised the stink with powder and perfumes. Simply put, in spite of Versailles visual splendor, it was an unsavory place, filled with indolent, wasteful, maliferous people.

The standard of acting for the series is good and yes, its watchable. It is, after all, inherently interesting material. Yet, so much is misrepresented, that this production is rendered more a fiction than an historical period piece. As such, it should be considered entertainment and little more. Six out of ten from me."
Versailles,The king and court come to life,"I think the casting is superb. Add beautiful surroundings and great acting and add the story of Louis XIV and you will have a show that pulls you into the middle of life in Versailles. I know they took liberties with the story, and sexed it all up, but not in a bad way. There is no 21st century holier-than-thou attitude, which is nice. They did things differently back in the 1600's and here is a show that portrays some of that, without preaching. It is rare that audiences are given credit for having brains enough to form opinions of their own about the characters. Things in Versailles are not all black and white, good and bad--there are many, many shades of gray here. It takes a lot to be able to show all those shades, and I think Versailles succeeds admirably."
Versailles,Slightly Flawed History Yet Exciting,"As with most of these historical productions about real kings and queens, there are a number of discrepancies regarding the facts. That said, this really is an intriguing and exciting series full of pageantry and wonderful costuming and sets. There is also some fine acting, especially with the characters of Phillipe, King Louis's brother, and Fabien, the kings head of security. Their characters are nuanced, much more so than the king himself. This is a series worth watching, especially for lovers of historical pieces."
Versailles,At Least the Set was Nice,"Knowing there wasn't going to be a fourth series I stuck with Versailles through to its conclusion just to see how it would end though had it gone on to another series I'd have given up after Series Two. Mock spoiler alert, it ends not with a bang but with a whimper as though its makers gave up and went through the motions like a team that knows its beaten and is just waiting for the final whistle. Versailles covers a roughly 20 year period of Louis XIV's reign but the actors don't age. Not a grey hair in sight. The acting is of a good-to-high standard, particularly given the level of some dialogue. The quality deteriorates as the series progresses - or perhaps I should say regresses. At least early on there were sexual shenanigans to distract the viewer. Not surprisingly the writers opt for the more sensational stories relating to the period such as that of the pious queen allegedly giving birth to a black baby by a court dwarf. Needless to say we get The Man in Iron Mask. Now there was a real life man in a velvet mask, though there's no evidence of him interacting with the royal family. But since we don't know for certain who he was, why he was imprisoned, and why he was masked the writers were free to come up with their own story about him. It's just a pity they didn't come up with a more credible or at least an entertaining one. History goes out the window. The queen died of natural causes, she wasn't murdered. The man in the velvet mask died in prison of natural causes long after the events portrayed. In the series Colbert opposes the revocation of The Edict of Nantes. In fact he was long dead when the Edict was revoked. A totally fictitious back story is invented for the devout Madame de Maintenon as a prostitute but her interesting mixed Protestant-Catholic upbringing was ignored. For me the nadir was reached in the penultimate episode in an exchange between Louis and Bossuet. When Louis says it was man who based the church in Rome Bossuet replies, ""Saint Paul himself...""! You'd think the man the Catholic Encyclopedia considered as perhaps the greatest pulpit preacher of all time might know the line, ""you are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church."" For me these inaccuracies wouldn't grate so much if there were good storylines. I enjoy Vikings even though its historical elements are greatly compressed in time. It has credible narratives and, while Versailles had some storylines to begin with, by the end the writers having abandon history seemed to run out of interesting plots."
Versailles,Stop throwing shade on Le Roi Soleil,"This king was a showman, not an insecure philosopher, spectacularly controlling, not a bit shy. To him the only crime was to be a bore. You might start with a makeover of the look and let the acting follow. Please do a better job with the men's hair and costumes. This is France, not dowdy old England. Although I do like the Mark Farner '70s rock star chevelure imagined for the king (who is very well cast with a short actor), all portraits of him show a cloud of curls from cradle to grave (wigs, of course). The fabrics are couture, but too neutral. That little red bow tie over the white lace cravat would have been three times as wide and multiplied by seven, like a holiday bottle of cognac. (Again, look at the portraiture.) Conspicuously absent: the fabulous music of Marc Antoine Charpentier and Lully, the Paintings of Le Brun, Mignard and Le Moyne, the solid silver furniture that nearly bankrupt the nation. Look to the movie, Vatel, for better food and fete inspiration. Monsieur said it best when Louis chided him about the 50,000 ecus shoe note with: ""But you haven't seen the shoes!"" No, we haven't."

Versailles,Gloriously decadent,"Had to rewatch the entire series from the start after achieving the bucket list item of travelling half way across the world to visit the palace and found it to be even more delicious the second time round. You will enjoy the opulence and beauty of the palace and its grounds which are beautifully shot and even more beautiful in person. Enjoy the deception, intrigue and scheming as the nobles jostle for favouritism and ask yourself if anything has really changed all these centuries on. Immerse yourself in the history and traditions of the French Court where one of most heinous crimes surely is dressing poorly. Addictive and fun. Highly recommend."
Versailles,Oppulently sloppy,"Like many of the recent caliber of period dramas, Versailles is heavy on titillation and shock-value which often trumps reality and authenticity to historic fact. Yet to its credit, the series does manage to get a bit of the real history, fashion and observations correct (many of which came from the letters of the actual residents at Versailles). But the biggest drawback to overcome is the lead actor playing Louis XIV; he plays the typical British aristocratic archetype and neither displays nor knows anything about the people and culture he is representing...there is literally NOTHING remotely French about him. This goes equally for MANY of the others in the cast, as if they can just play a 1-to-1 British to French Fop (even the peasants brandish a cockney accent to underscore their class...because it MUST be that way everywhere if it's like that in London...right?) The VERY British writers just can't seem to understand the mindset or motivations of French, aristocrats, Catholics or pretty much anything they are trying to represent here. I really wanted to expect more from this since Canal+ participated, but sadly it just boils down to being a British period soap opera that could have been set anywhere."
Versailles,Fantastic,This programme is such a brilliant work of art I hardly have words. Every scene is breath taking. The scenery and costumes are outstanding. The casting is superb. George Blagden as Louis X1V and Alexander Vlahis as his brother are both breathtakingly gorgeous and so utterly mesmerising to watch. I also really like Tygh Runyon as Fabian. Such a fantastic and strong cast. I can't rate this enough. This deserves so many awards.
Versailles,special,"A historical serie. At the first sigh, another. Not spectacular - the clothes, architecture, mixture of politic, sex and misteries is far to be surprising - but special for the high care for details, for inspired exploration of familiar facts from history lessons and for nice performances. And sure, for the balance between the details defining the rise of a king. Seductive, provocative and beautiful. So, special as chronicle of a reign changing, in deep sense, the history of France."

Versailles,"Sadly, not a historical portrait","Great sets, nice wardrobe, very good acting... Too many queer thrown fits, too many sluggish conspiracies, apparently aimed to give the series an overextended duration... A little too far from history to be better ranked..."
Versailles,LIGHT WEIGHT SOAP OPERA,"A soap opera wrapped in royal regalia. The sets and costumes are incredible but at no point did I bond with the actors despite a very decent cast. Small time plots that lead nowhere and writing filled with small screen cliches. I found myself waiting for anything to grip me but 2 seasons later, still no joy. It's a shame but don't waste your time."
Versailles,Absolutely gorgeous,"And I'm not simply referring to Alexander Vlahos! The scenery is sumptuous and glorious, as are the costumes. The place, Versailles, is now firmly on my list of places I must visit. I went to Hampton Court Palace recently and that was a magnificent place but I think it will pale in comparison.

The show is, I believe, reasonably true to history. I've done some reading about the various characters and while of course the show writers have filled in the gaps as they saw fit, they've stuck to history for the important aspects. Let's be fair, they do need to make it flow and be entertaining enough to keep our attention!

George and Alexander are simply marvelous, I absolutely love their portrayals of the two brothers. I could watch Philippe for hours on end, he's that fabulous as the gay/bi cross dressing prince. Credit must go to all of the cast who are wonderful supporting characters, and also to production design and costumes/hair which could have let the entire enterprise down had they not been well done but it's all been done beautifully.

If you enjoy period/historical drama then you'll love this show. I can't wait for season 3!"
Northern Rescue,"Monsieur, Alexander Vlahos stole the show","Forget about the sun King Louis XIV, this show introduces us to his eccentric, fabulous, incredibly smart brother often under the shadow of the sun. The actor perfectly delivered the emotional dimension, complexity of the character, and I couldn't help but be a fan. I also ended up searching historical facts about Philippe, what a truly interesting character he was! Alexander Vlahos deserved a grammy for this."
Northern Rescue,For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue.,"For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue. Absolutely love this show. Visually rich and very nice attention to detail and character development. Great acting in general but no doubt props going to George Blagden as Louis XIV (who is also amazing in Viking another epic show) and Alexander Vlahos as Philippe (a very great character analysis).

This show reminds me a bit of The Tudors with Jonathan R Meyers but so far much better about pacing and accuracy.

I seriously want three maybe more of Louis XIV and hope they continue with other rulers i.e Louis XV aka Beloved and Louis XVI with Marie Antoinette. Seriously need more shows like this. History is far more interesting than made of stuff half the time.

Great job cast and crew."
Northern Rescue,Louis - Mon amour!,"Yet another fantastic TV-series that makes me want to learn more about history. I thank the creators of this for making me more curious about what really happened. Very beautiful and well acted.

I have binge-watched this twice in three days, so I think I can offer my opinion. It is very good TV!

Blagden and Vlahos perform excellently; the plot is very much about two brothers, a new and fresh angle of the Sun King I haven't seen before. It is also about building a home, a palace, and also about building a country.

I doubt a proper historian would approve, but I don't mind. This is good TV and I like it a lot.

Since I already googled the crap out of Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans, I guess I have made my point. This made me learn a bit more about this era, and also see how it influences the oligarchy in our present time.

Very well crafted entertainment - I recommend you watch it at least twice. That way you will get to know the characters better. Season two? Can't wait!"
Northern Rescue,A feast for the eyes,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for a series to come along that I look forward to each episode. This is it. Absolutely gorgeous, stunning settings, costumes and sets.

The actors are fascinating. I don't care if it is minute by minute historically accurate as I can read a history book about Versailles and life there, but this is super interesting as a drama within that palace and time frame. Everyone is just so real. They are horrible, loving, scheming, nasty, lavish, flamboyant, crafty and violent, but isn't that what real life and humans are all about? I am loving the costumes, jewels, food, florals, decor and art.

Fingers crossed for Season 2."
Northern Rescue,Opulent and Addictive,"We do not expect historical accuracy from a series featuring French royalty. Rather, we expect opulence, much action and intrigue, with a fair amount of sex and decadence. Well, Versailles has that in spades, and not knowing much about the France of that period, I am taking much of it with a pinch of salt, but I think this is really good television.

The plot meanders a bit at times, and of course Louis was building his nation, and at times Versailles seems more important than his country, but of course it represents France and all that we associate with it most splendidly, even today.

Beyond the nation building, Louis had to deal with a troublesome group of noblemen who seemed to spend all their time plotting against him and killing off people to whom he was attached. No wonder the poor French got rid of their royalty eventually, it must have seemed very troublesome to those whose lives were harder and less important.

It is superb television and I think the scriptwriters can take real credit for building a series where Louis plays members of his court (and even his own family) off against each other with skill and aplomb. He was clearly born to be a king.

This is great TV and I can't wait for Series 2 which I am told is in the pipeline.

Mary Gumsley"
Northern Rescue,Addictive viewing,"One of those shows it took me some time to get round to watching, but after binge watching Series 1 I have to say it is excellent viewing, I'll agree with other reviewers who highlight there are very definitely historical inaccuracies, the birth of the Queen's baby etc, but they can be overlooked, as the drama is somehow addictive. It is very raunchy, lots of sex scenes, and lots of gay sex scenes, shock horror.

The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish, you cannot helped but be wowed by the sheer majesty of the buildings and surroundings, The Palace of Versailles itself almost takes on the role of an extra character, it's so impressive. It is visually always on the money, the filming, music etc, are first rate, utterly faultless.

I'm so glad they chose not to put on dodgy French accents, so often spoil historical dramas.

George Blagden is an outstanding lead actor, he looks so incredibly different in costume, I think he's wonderful in the role, masses of charisma. So well matched is Alexander Vlahos, who plays his brother, totally suited to the part, fair to say he adds masses of variety to the show.

Great to see that Series 3 has been commissioned, meaning plenty of Versailles to come. Great show. 8/10"
Northern Rescue,More than just your average costume drama,"This drama is about the rise of Louis xiv, the Sun King, Louis the Great, who moved the executive from Paris, the centre of the known world to Versailles, a great bog.

With his father long dead, his mother recently dead, he was alone except for his brother and those he trusted. His political marriage to a Spanish princess was not happy.

He is primarily concerned with how to rule a growing French Empire. This French court evolved into something strange - where dancing and etiquette were critical politically.

This is made in English (to ease it commercially) but by the French so it is made with taste. There are attractive actors, lavish costumes, special effects (to pretend it was shot in the Palace itself) and of course scenes of violence and sex. After all, its good to be the King.

Looking forward to Season 2 !"

But since we don't know for certain who he was, why he was imprisoned, and why he was masked the writers were free to come up with their own story about him. It's just a pity they didn't come up with a more credible or at least an entertaining one. History goes out the window. The queen died of natural causes, she wasn't murdered. The man in the velvet mask died in prison of natural causes long after the events portrayed. In the series Colbert opposes the revocation of The Edict of Nantes. In fact he was long dead when the Edict was revoked. A totally fictitious back story is invented for the devout Madame de Maintenon as a prostitute but her interesting mixed Protestant-Catholic upbringing was ignored. For me the nadir was reached in the penultimate episode in an exchange between Louis and Bossuet. When Louis says it was man who based the church in Rome Bossuet replies, ""Saint Paul himself...""! You'd think the man the Catholic Encyclopedia considered as perhaps the greatest pulpit preacher of all time might know the line, ""you are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church."" For me these inaccuracies wouldn't grate so much if there were good storylines. I enjoy Vikings even though its historical elements are greatly compressed in time. It has credible narratives and, while Versailles had some storylines to begin with, by the end the writers having abandon history seemed to run out of interesting plots."
Northern Rescue,Stop throwing shade on Le Roi Soleil,"This king was a showman, not an insecure philosopher, spectacularly controlling, not a bit shy. To him the only crime was to be a bore. You might start with a makeover of the look and let the acting follow. Please do a better job with the men's hair and costumes. This is France, not dowdy old England. Although I do like the Mark Farner '70s rock star chevelure imagined for the king (who is very well cast with a short actor), all portraits of him show a cloud of curls from cradle to grave (wigs, of course). The fabrics are couture, but too neutral. That little red bow tie over the white lace cravat would have been three times as wide and multiplied by seven, like a holiday bottle of cognac. (Again, look at the portraiture.) Conspicuously absent: the fabulous music of Marc Antoine Charpentier and Lully, the Paintings of Le Brun, Mignard and Le Moyne, the solid silver furniture that nearly bankrupt the nation. Look to the movie, Vatel, for better food and fete inspiration. Monsieur said it best when Louis chided him about the 50,000 ecus shoe note with: ""But you haven't seen the shoes!"" No, we haven't."

Northern Rescue,Gloriously decadent,"Had to rewatch the entire series from the start after achieving the bucket list item of travelling half way across the world to visit the palace and found it to be even more delicious the second time round. You will enjoy the opulence and beauty of the palace and its grounds which are beautifully shot and even more beautiful in person. Enjoy the deception, intrigue and scheming as the nobles jostle for favouritism and ask yourself if anything has really changed all these centuries on. Immerse yourself in the history and traditions of the French Court where one of most heinous crimes surely is dressing poorly. Addictive and fun. Highly recommend."
Northern Rescue,Oppulently sloppy,"Like many of the recent caliber of period dramas, Versailles is heavy on titillation and shock-value which often trumps reality and authenticity to historic fact. Yet to its credit, the series does manage to get a bit of the real history, fashion and observations correct (many of which came from the letters of the actual residents at Versailles). But the biggest drawback to overcome is the lead actor playing Louis XIV; he plays the typical British aristocratic archetype and neither displays nor knows anything about the people and culture he is representing...there is literally NOTHING remotely French about him. This goes equally for MANY of the others in the cast, as if they can just play a 1-to-1 British to French Fop (even the peasants brandish a cockney accent to underscore their class...because it MUST be that way everywhere if it's like that in London...right?) The VERY British writers just can't seem to understand the mindset or motivations of French, aristocrats, Catholics or pretty much anything they are trying to represent here. I really wanted to expect more from this since Canal+ participated, but sadly it just boils down to being a British period soap opera that could have been set anywhere."
Northern Rescue,Fantastic,This programme is such a brilliant work of art I hardly have words. Every scene is breath taking. The scenery and costumes are outstanding. The casting is superb. George Blagden as Louis X1V and Alexander Vlahis as his brother are both breathtakingly gorgeous and so utterly mesmerising to watch. I also really like Tygh Runyon as Fabian. Such a fantastic and strong cast. I can't rate this enough. This deserves so many awards.

Northern Rescue,LIGHT WEIGHT SOAP OPERA,"A soap opera wrapped in royal regalia. The sets and costumes are incredible but at no point did I bond with the actors despite a very decent cast. Small time plots that lead nowhere and writing filled with small screen cliches. I found myself waiting for anything to grip me but 2 seasons later, still no joy. It's a shame but don't waste your time."
Northern Rescue,Absolutely gorgeous,"And I'm not simply referring to Alexander Vlahos! The scenery is sumptuous and glorious, as are the costumes. The place, Versailles, is now firmly on my list of places I must visit. I went to Hampton Court Palace recently and that was a magnificent place but I think it will pale in comparison.

The show is, I believe, reasonably true to history. I've done some reading about the various characters and while of course the show writers have filled in the gaps as they saw fit, they've stuck to history for the important aspects. Let's be fair, they do need to make it flow and be entertaining enough to keep our attention!

George and Alexander are simply marvelous, I absolutely love their portrayals of the two brothers. I could watch Philippe for hours on end, he's that fabulous as the gay/bi cross dressing prince. Credit must go to all of the cast who are wonderful supporting characters, and also to production design and costumes/hair which could have let the entire enterprise down had they not been well done but it's all been done beautifully.

If you enjoy period/historical drama then you'll love this show. I can't wait for season 3!"
Christine,"Monsieur, Alexander Vlahos stole the show","Forget about the sun King Louis XIV, this show introduces us to his eccentric, fabulous, incredibly smart brother often under the shadow of the sun. The actor perfectly delivered the emotional dimension, complexity of the character, and I couldn't help but be a fan. I also ended up searching historical facts about Philippe, what a truly interesting character he was! Alexander Vlahos deserved a grammy for this."
Christine,For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue.,"For Lovers of History who can forgive some inaccuracy for decadence and intrigue. Absolutely love this show. Visually rich and very nice attention to detail and character development. Great acting in general but no doubt props going to George Blagden as Louis XIV (who is also amazing in Viking another epic show) and Alexander Vlahos as Philippe (a very great character analysis).

This show reminds me a bit of The Tudors with Jonathan R Meyers but so far much better about pacing and accuracy.

I seriously want three maybe more of Louis XIV and hope they continue with other rulers i.e Louis XV aka Beloved and Louis XVI with Marie Antoinette. Seriously need more shows like this. History is far more interesting than made of stuff half the time.

Great job cast and crew."
Christine,Louis - Mon amour!,"Yet another fantastic TV-series that makes me want to learn more about history. I thank the creators of this for making me more curious about what really happened. Very beautiful and well acted.

I have binge-watched this twice in three days, so I think I can offer my opinion. It is very good TV!

Blagden and Vlahos perform excellently; the plot is very much about two brothers, a new and fresh angle of the Sun King I haven't seen before. It is also about building a home, a palace, and also about building a country.

I doubt a proper historian would approve, but I don't mind. This is good TV and I like it a lot.

Since I already googled the crap out of Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans, I guess I have made my point. This made me learn a bit more about this era, and also see how it influences the oligarchy in our present time.

Very well crafted entertainment - I recommend you watch it at least twice. That way you will get to know the characters better. Season two? Can't wait!"
Christine,A feast for the eyes,"I've been waiting for what seems like ages for a series to come along that I look forward to each episode. This is it. Absolutely gorgeous, stunning settings, costumes and sets.

The actors are fascinating. I don't care if it is minute by minute historically accurate as I can read a history book about Versailles and life there, but this is super interesting as a drama within that palace and time frame. Everyone is just so real. They are horrible, loving, scheming, nasty, lavish, flamboyant, crafty and violent, but isn't that what real life and humans are all about? I am loving the costumes, jewels, food, florals, decor and art.

Fingers crossed for Season 2."
Christine,Opulent and Addictive,"We do not expect historical accuracy from a series featuring French royalty. Rather, we expect opulence, much action and intrigue, with a fair amount of sex and decadence. Well, Versailles has that in spades, and not knowing much about the France of that period, I am taking much of it with a pinch of salt, but I think this is really good television.

The plot meanders a bit at times, and of course Louis was building his nation, and at times Versailles seems more important than his country, but of course it represents France and all that we associate with it most splendidly, even today.

Beyond the nation building, Louis had to deal with a troublesome group of noblemen who seemed to spend all their time plotting against him and killing off people to whom he was attached. No wonder the poor French got rid of their royalty eventually, it must have seemed very troublesome to those whose lives were harder and less important.

It is superb television and I think the scriptwriters can take real credit for building a series where Louis plays members of his court (and even his own family) off against each other with skill and aplomb. He was clearly born to be a king.

This is great TV and I can't wait for Series 2 which I am told is in the pipeline.

Mary Gumsley"
Christine,Addictive viewing,"One of those shows it took me some time to get round to watching, but after binge watching Series 1 I have to say it is excellent viewing, I'll agree with other reviewers who highlight there are very definitely historical inaccuracies, the birth of the Queen's baby etc, but they can be overlooked, as the drama is somehow addictive. It is very raunchy, lots of sex scenes, and lots of gay sex scenes, shock horror.

The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish, you cannot helped but be wowed by the sheer majesty of the buildings and surroundings, The Palace of Versailles itself almost takes on the role of an extra character, it's so impressive. It is visually always on the money, the filming, music etc, are first rate, utterly faultless.

I'm so glad they chose not to put on dodgy French accents, so often spoil historical dramas.

George Blagden is an outstanding lead actor, he looks so incredibly different in costume, I think he's wonderful in the role, masses of charisma. So well matched is Alexander Vlahos, who plays his brother, totally suited to the part, fair to say he adds masses of variety to the show.

Great to see that Series 3 has been commissioned, meaning plenty of Versailles to come. Great show. 8/10"
Christine,More than just your average costume drama,"This drama is about the rise of Louis xiv, the Sun King, Louis the Great, who moved the executive from Paris, the centre of the known world to Versailles, a great bog.

With his father long dead, his mother recently dead, he was alone except for his brother and those he trusted. His political marriage to a Spanish princess was not happy.

He is primarily concerned with how to rule a growing French Empire. This French court evolved into something strange - where dancing and etiquette were critical politically.

This is made in English (to ease it commercially) but by the French so it is made with taste. There are attractive actors, lavish costumes, special effects (to pretend it was shot in the Palace itself) and of course scenes of violence and sex. After all, its good to be the King.

Looking forward to Season 2 !"
Christine,"Pretty good TV series , lavishly produced , dealing with historical characters : Louis XIV , Philippe d'Orléans , among others","Based on historic deeds about intrigue and power-fight in Louis XIV court . This costumer movie is partially based on real events and starts in 1667 , with 28-year-old all-powerful king of France, Louis XIV . It toplines two rising British stars , Georges Blagden (""Vikings"") in the role of Louis XIV and Alexander Vlahos in the role of Monsieur , the Sun King's enigmatic as well as gay brother whose couple is the scheming Chevalier , Evan Williams . His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history , he married Marie-Thérèse (Elisa Lasowski) and being son of Anne of Austria (Dominique Blanc) and Louis XIII (David Stanley) . It's developed in the court of Louis XIV who decides to build the greatest palace in the world - Versailles . This well-known monarch governed in domains where the sun never set ; as Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from the capital . We should have the same intelligence as this monarch and take advantage of the power of this story and of its marvellous renaissance background . He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and , by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles -formerly a hunting lodge belonging to Louis's father- , succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy , many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis's minority . However , his brother Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans (Alexander Vlahos) has for some time been relegated to a lesser role in the Court , due to the growing power of the King' most influential secretaries , Bontemps (Stuart Bowman) , Colbert (Steve Cumyn) and especially the security chief , the relentless executioner , Fabien Marchal (Tygh Runyan) . Meantime , the situation of France is threatened by Holland ruled under charismatic William of Orange (George Webster) , being the situation of Louis XIV extremely dangerous and delicate . In the meantime , Louis decides to construct a big palace at an inhospitable place , but drained Budget , affairs and political intrigues complicate things . Louis XIV is in constant conflict with his workers and those traitors who possesses privileged information can acquire immense fortunes . During Louis's reign , France was the leading European power and it fought three major wars : the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession . Then , a dark conspiracy and the harassing by William of Orange make Versailles an uncomfortable place .

This upscale epic drama penned by David Wolstencroft (""The Escape Artist"") and Simon Mirren (""Criminal Minds"" , ¨Third watch¨) , The 10-episode show was big budgeted , developed and co-produced by Canal Plus' original creation division . The series was in development for five years before the cameras started to roll . As of 2015, this is the most expensive television show ever produced in France . Despite being a largely French-financed project, the series was shot in English with an eye toward a larger international audience. According to costume designer Madeline Fontaine, the production required the making of about 100 key cast member costume , and about 200 mass-produced extras costumes. The Emmy Awards hosted an exclusive screening of the series pilot for its members during a board meeting in Versailles . Produced by Zodiak Fiction and Incendo , bowed onseries broke ratings record for an original drama on Canal Plus since 2013 .

This TV series recreates faithfully the historical facts , as long time us separate from the events are to narrate , but the shadows still hide from the public this great historic moment , and the significance of such deeds . ¨Versailles¨ TV series is filled with those lights and shadows , gathers such a very important known event recreated in the artistic frame called French Golden Age , characterized and inspired by the ideas of an absolutism realm . The series contributes to historical , artistical and cultural memory of an era , with a look back to the past , offering us an interesting adaptation on important events . This is a lavish budget but slowly-paced costumer and full of nudism and simulated sex with a good cast who gives nice interpretations , it has Georges Blagden as authoritarian King . Personality and charisma of George Blagden's portrayal as one of the most remarkable European kings that ever reigned . His wife Marie-Thérèse is well played by Elisa Lasowski and his homosexual brother Monsieur Philippe d'Orléans by Alexander Vlahos , and married to Henriette performed by Noémie Schmidt whose gorgeous beauty is difficult to resist . And Tygh Runyan as Marchal gives his big opportunity to really shine . Amira Casar gives a convincing character as astute and mean Béatrice . Stuart Bowman plays with enormous distinction as Bontemps , the incorruptible as well as cunning adviser . The rest of the supporting cast is nice , such as the gay lover Chevalier acted by Evan Williams , Anatole Taubman as traitor Montcourt , Lizzie Brocheré as the doctor Claudine , Sarah Winter as Louise and several others . The series is marvelously photographed throughout as well as written and directed . Extraordinary costume design accompanied by colorful cinematography filmed on location . As the costume team consisted of about thirty people , including the series' main designer, her auxiliary design team, stitchers and fitters . Luxurious sets make excellent use of real locations in Versailles and it has a look of a great TV production . ¨Versailles¨ has been greenlit by the French pay TV giant for a second season (the first is set in the year 1667) that takes place four years after the events in season one."
Christine,"A feast for the eyes and ears, without a doubt!","A feast for the eyes and ears, without a doubt! A great and pleasant surprise. Excellent and promising players! A series that are worth seeing, tells the story of the French King Louis XIV known as the Sun King of the 17th century, a king, smart handler, subtle, and your affectionate relationship but complicated with his brother Philippe, his court of friends and enemies, the conspiracies and interests, their lovers and its unwavering decision to build the famous and beautiful Palace of Versailles. Not being a documentary on the life of the King, the main idea is there and very well written and represented, with scenarios, clothing and spectacular dialogs. Congratulations to all of you, to the team of Versailles. I look forward to season 2 :-)"
Christine,A long way from the truth....,"Versailles is yet another example of revisionist history that paints a misleading picture of the life and politics of Louis XIV, known as the Sun King.

This drama presents the young French King as an astute, visionary. Much of the narrative is used to make the King sound clever, by having those around him make transparently stupid observations. My favourite is his head of internal security congratulating the King on signing a peace treaty, saying ""the war has ended"". Its an implausibly absurd comment, given the same head of security is surrounded, at that moment, by men killed as a result of what amounts to a domestic war between the King and elements of the nobility. A war he, as head of internal security, is personally charged with fighting.

The reality of Louis XIV is a lot less glamorous. A parasitic individual, who could only sustain his extravagance through rather ugly acts of domestic usury, theft, international conquest and imperialism. That's not to say Louis was any worse than his contemporaries but, to try to portray him in such an overstated and flattering light, makes a lie of historical truth.

Versailles was hardly the pristine, architectural marvel, its presented as either. People defecated and urinated in hallways, diseases, especially of the venereal variety, were rife. The nobility populating the hallways and rooms of this palace, were not the nice, clean, well scrubbed types presented in this series. They were a dirty lot, who washed infrequently and disguised the stink with powder and perfumes. Simply put, in spite of Versailles visual splendor, it was an unsavory place, filled with indolent, wasteful, maliferous people.

The standard of acting for the series is good and yes, its watchable. It is, after all, inherently interesting material. Yet, so much is misrepresented, that this production is rendered more a fiction than an historical period piece. As such, it should be considered entertainment and little more. Six out of ten from me."
Christine,The king and court come to life,"I think the casting is superb. Add beautiful surroundings and great acting and add the story of Louis XIV and you will have a show that pulls you into the middle of life in Versailles. I know they took liberties with the story, and sexed it all up, but not in a bad way. There is no 21st century holier-than-thou attitude, which is nice. They did things differently back in the 1600's and here is a show that portrays some of that, without preaching. It is rare that audiences are given credit for having brains enough to form opinions of their own about the characters. Things in Versailles are not all black and white, good and bad--there are many, many shades of gray here. It takes a lot to be able to show all those shades, and I think Versailles succeeds admirably."
Christine,Slightly Flawed History Yet Exciting,"As with most of these historical productions about real kings and queens, there are a number of discrepancies regarding the facts. That said, this really is an intriguing and exciting series full of pageantry and wonderful costuming and sets. There is also some fine acting, especially with the characters of Phillipe, King Louis's brother, and Fabien, the kings head of security. Their characters are nuanced, much more so than the king himself. This is a series worth watching, especially for lovers of historical pieces."
Christine,At Least the Set was Nice,"Knowing there wasn't going to be a fourth series I stuck with Versailles through to its conclusion just to see how it would end though had it gone on to another series I'd have given up after Series Two. Mock spoiler alert, it ends not with a bang but with a whimper as though its makers gave up and went through the motions like a team that knows its beaten and is just waiting for the final whistle. Versailles covers a roughly 20 year period of Louis XIV's reign but the actors don't age. Not a grey hair in sight. The acting is of a good-to-high standard, particularly given the level of some dialogue. The quality deteriorates as the series progresses - or perhaps I should say regresses. At least early on there were sexual shenanigans to distract the viewer. Not surprisingly the writers opt for the more sensational stories relating to the period such as that of the pious queen allegedly giving birth to a black baby by a court dwarf. Needless to say we get The Man in Iron Mask. Now there was a real life man in a velvet mask, though there's no evidence of him interacting with the royal family. But since we don't know for certain who he was, why he was imprisoned, and why he was masked the writers were free to come up with their own story about him. It's just a pity they didn't come up with a more credible or at least an entertaining one. History goes out the window. The queen died of natural causes, she wasn't murdered. The man in the velvet mask died in prison of natural causes long after the events portrayed. In the series Colbert opposes the revocation of The Edict of Nantes. In fact he was long dead when the Edict was revoked. A totally fictitious back story is invented for the devout Madame de Maintenon as a prostitute but her interesting mixed Protestant-Catholic upbringing was ignored. For me the nadir was reached in the penultimate episode in an exchange between Louis and Bossuet. When Louis says it was man who based the church in Rome Bossuet replies, ""Saint Paul himself...""! You'd think the man the Catholic Encyclopedia considered as perhaps the greatest pulpit preacher of all time might know the line, ""you are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church."" For me these inaccuracies wouldn't grate so much if there were good storylines. I enjoy Vikings even though its historical elements are greatly compressed in time. It has credible narratives and, while Versailles had some storylines to begin with, by the end the writers having abandon history seemed to run out of interesting plots."

White Gold,Very funny piece of eighties nostalgia,"You know your getting old when they start making shows from an era you grew up in. As you watch it you start to point out the cars, clothes, music and haircuts the 80's really were the time that fashion forgot. The makers of the show have nailed that period in time superbly, and the script by Inbetweeners creator Damon Beesley is equally good. Anyone who lived through that period would have come across the lead character Vince Swan played by the impressive Ed Weswick. In the case of White Gold we have double glazing salesman all pushing for that big end of month bonus. But it could just as easily been Estate Agents Car Salesmen the 80s were all about excess and earning as much money as you could and that's really the premise of the show in a nutshell. There are natural comparisons to the Inbetweeners as Joe Thomas and James Buckley play pretty much play the same characters Jay and Simon in this show, nothing wrong with that the Inbetweeners was one the funniest sitcoms of recent years. And whilst White Gold may not reach those dizzy heights it's not far behind."
White Gold,"A good series, but as good as I would have hoped!","Overall, a very good series to watch on a rainy day but not one to stay up for!

If you're looking for something like ""The Inbetweeners"", this is probably NOT the series you would have hoped for. Though Joe Thomas and James Buckley's characters certainly have similar personas in this series, the whole show being dominated by Ed Westwick's imposing character means that the overall vibe is less childish and juvenile without turning dark.

A clever and comic plot, with hints of irony and at times bitter humour, whilst keeping some with some scenes being humorous in a rather vulgar way. The plot is quite memorable, and some scenes certainly have a deeper meaning to them; the final episode leaves one thinking about the ending for a some time afterwards. You certainly want to binge watch all the episodes at once, but perhaps not as much as ""Cuckoo"" or ""Fresh Meat"".

Despite this, I would not say it is as funny or accomplished as other British comedies with similar target audiences (""Cuckoo"", for example is much funnier in my opinion). The main problem with this new show is that we hardly feel any empathy for characters, Ed Westwick's character is quite unlikable and the only character we really feel sorry for is Sam Swan (Lindsey Cocker). We understand that the others are quite irritating and annoying figures, but that's about it!

The other reason I find that this show is not as funny as it could be is because its seems a bit restrained in terms of use of language and insults. The show was shown at 10pm, and words such as ""c**t"" are used throughout the series. Vulgarities are then certainly present, yet it feels as though Joe Thomas and James Buckley's insults are quite restrained. And those two characters' vulgar and overly-offensive insults were some of the most hilarious parts of ""The Inbetweeners"".

""White Gold"" is then certainly good, but did slightly disappoint after shows like ""The Inbetweeners"" where I felt that Thomas and Buckley were at their best."
White Gold,BRILLIANT move by Netflix,"Lets see more of these UK shows on Netflix. There's a huge expat market in the USA and we miss the type of telly we know and love from the UK.

No one from England should have any trouble understanding an Essex accent. I saw the review where someone had trouble understanding the dialog. Bless."
White Gold,Alfie... in the eighties!,"Damon Beesley is primarily a TV producer but when he does write, it's gold... and in this case - White Gold! The brains behind 'The Inbetweeners' hits the mark again with this comedy-drama (emphasis on comedy) about the lives of three Essex double-glazing salesmen.

Ed Westwick plays fast-talking Vincent who narrates directly to the camera to keep us in tune with what's going on in his world. It's an excellent rip-off of Michael Caine's 1966 'Alfie' device (and character... which Jude Law failed to pull off in 2004.)

The opening gag from the first episode sets the tone for the series... it's crude, tacky, rude... and very, very funny. If you liked 'The Inbetweeners' then you'll feel right at home here. The only difference is that the swearing here is real and not a made up language to beat the watershed.

Just drooling over a rare sighting of the drop-dead gorgeous Linzey Cocker playing ''er indoors' is another good reason to stick around. She's great fun as Vincent's sassy, foul-mouthed missus.

James Buckley and Joe Thomas team up again, and fill the screen with remarkable chemistry while they spar off each other effortlessly. Beesley should re-write 'The Odd Couple' for these two!

The musical inserts are spot on and a fantastic reminder of an unremarkable time in the UK where wide boys drank Stella from sleeve glasses and thick hair and thin ties were de rigueur!

I'd love to see the show renewed but I'm not sure it could be. Things seemed to tie up nicely at the end and maybe there's only so much eighties nostalgia any one man can tolerate!

I loved this program and it made a fantastic change from the insipid rubbish churned out masquerading as comedy over the last few years. The BBC doesn't do comedy very well anymore but on this occasion, they have hit the mark!"
White Gold,2 series is probably a good fit,"Yeah its original (ish) Sometimes its like watching Jay from the inbetweeners with a tash and a job and simon with the same problems and a job.

Theres only so far you can take something when you are recycling the same material within a series so to stop this from dying an undignified death it may be better to let it be.

However i have a feeling that timeshare will be next on the list and unless the writing at BBC2 comes up with something better a lower score might be applied later.

However some humour and laughter, good enough for a 7 even. Just no more."
White Gold,PLEASE NETFLIX... PICK UP WHERE THIS BRILLIANT SHOW LEFT OFF!!!,"This is a one of a kind show that should NOT be canceled. The actors, witty scripts and awesome 80s tunes were a winning recipe if I ever saw one."
White Gold,"Season 1 is great, season 2 falls a bit flat.","I really liked Season 1, great set up, however it really did seem to drop the ball in season 2. Season 2 wasn't terrible, but as far as writing goes seemed quite lazy. It looks great, something that can be said for both season's, and has a very strong 80's feel to it - clothing and all that really well done. With a shift to the aspect ratio I might even have believed it could have been made in the 80s.

Season 1 is an easy 8/10. Season 2 more 6/10 (liked the characters, however the story lost its legs a bit).

I would like to see a season 3, though I wouldn't know where they'll go with it. End of season 2 didn't feel as though it was open to a season 3 that could include all of the same characters. I won't say why.

I would say if you like things like Benidorm (first couple of season), and or the Inbetweeners, then this might be up your street."
White Gold,What a Cracker,"This series was outrageously enjoyable. It made even the best telly drama and comedy look insipid – think of Only Fools and Horses with realism, Men Behaving Badly with pathos, Sherlock with engaging vulgarity and Bluestone 42 you couldn't add to that because it was similarly uncompromising. All the cast were terrific but it was Ed Westwick's take on Vincent, the leading character, which did the heavy-lifting. The usual compliments for a good performance aren't sufficient – 'electrifying and totally committed' get nowhere near - all art is artifice so how about, 'So real you could smell the b.o. breaking through the cheap deodorant. I loved the way he did asides to the audience and, once again (like Alfie, Flashman, Richard lll) was seduced by an appalling character's honesty in his villainy. However, as most of the other cast were almost as atrocious, and no one died, it was all utterly compelling. Sad, funny, serious and disgusting – it was brilliant and strictly for adults."
White Gold,Good Enough,"White Gold is a series that uses twists and the historical setting pretty well. If you enjoy British comedy, especially, you'll probably like it. However, it does get a bit too much and hard to believe after a while. The performances were good though and the soundtrack spot on."
White Gold,Loved it !,"This TV series, which just premiered on Netflix, is basically a chance to see Ed Westwick play the part of Chuck Bass again. If you loved the arrogant asshole that Chuck Bass was in Gossip Girl, you'll definitely love Vincent Swan. The cast in this show is absolutely great. Ed Westwick, James Buckley and Joe Thomas are an incredibly funny trio that you will for sure grow fond of over the episodes. If you've ever worked or been in contact with sales, you'll definitely relate to the characters and the situations that they find themselves in. It is a great example of a smart comedy. What I think makes the series so funny and interesting is the fact that the main character, Vincent, talks a lot to the audience, becoming also some sort of narrator. The soundtrack is also great, featuring a lot of amazing songs from the 70's and 80's , such as Another One Bites the Dust, by Queen. However, something that I've wondered is : How will the writers continue the series without making it boring, since, well, a salesman's life can be interesting only to an extent. There's one thing that,to me, isn't much of a problem, but I can understand why some people have complained about it is that, even if you are a fluent English speaker, but don't understand very well people that speak with a heavy Essex accent, you'll definitely have trouble understanding everything they say, which means you'll have to pay a great deal of attention to what's being said.

Pros - Great acting - Funny, but not stupid - Great soundtrack

Cons - How will they continue the story ( not necessarily a con) - Heavy accent"
White Gold,Low Brow Brit Humor With A Nod And A Wink...And Some Great 80's Tunes,Comentario no disponible
White Gold,EXCELLENT STORY TELLING.,"The writers of the show have written these episodes in ways that make you hate/like the protagonist but, enjoy seeing his world crumble as an act of Karma whilst listening to his whitty remarks he says about situations he gets into. I can imagine this not being everybodies cup of tea but don't turn away without watching one episode as the protagonist himself indirectly tells you that you will hate him.

The writers create the show to imitate those people that anger you by getting everything they want whilst they go on hurting people. However they may get everything they want at the price of getting everything they deserve."
White Gold,Season 2. Nowhere near as good as the first season.,"No spoilers, not many will have seen them all yet. All I can say is that after the spot on 80s setting, the brilliant soundtrack, and the beautiful comedy and drama mix of season 1, season 2 is a disappointment. After a strong start the episodes seem disjointed, contradictory, and rushed as the story reaches its climax. There's still some really good comedy in here, but it's almost as if they've concentrated on too many cast members at the expense of really following anything meaningful. I honestly think the creators rushed it and really just wanted to get us to the very different setting they've got planned for season 3. Worth a watch, but fans of the 1st season will be left feeling short changed."
White Gold,Brilliant,"Excellent comedy, brilliant music and very surprised it was cancelled after 2 seasons. Reminds me of a cross between the Inbetweeners and the wolf of Wall Street."
White Gold,So good!,"I was a huge fan of 'The Inbetweeners' (definitely go watch that if you enjoyed White Gold) so I was pleasantly surprised to see this show on Netflix when I logged in today. Very funny, very entertaining, and if you enjoy British and sarcastic humor you will enjoy this show. I told my friends my recommendation to them that it had a bit of ""the big short"" mixed in."
White Gold,Great viewing !,"This comedy series is very funny , I don't laugh at much on TV but this is spot on ! saw the first episode and had to watch the whole series in one go , if you like the inbetweeners type comedy with a bit more rudeness and swearing you are going to love this ....roll on the second series definitely a classic in the making"
White Gold,"OK, But Not Great (And No Inbetweeners!)","The comparison with 'Alfie' was pretty accurate, Vince Swan (played by Ed Weswick) breaks the fourth wall continuously to keep the plot movie. It provides some of the character's insights, but it can be distracting as it is hard to feel any compassion for Swan who is pretty much a self-centered jerk to his wife and coworkers.

Secondly, there is the annoyance of the constant 80s music. Trust me, I love 80s music but it seems to be overused in this series. And it's not just background music, it blares at the end of every scene. Just look at the playlists on the official website, there are 15-20 songs per episodes. It's just too much, and appears to be added just to draw in more viewers.

Overall it's not a bad show, James Buckley and Joe Thomas recreate their 'Inbetweeners' roles and interactions which are about the best thing going. Linzey Cocker gives a pretty good performance as Swan's suffering wife.

Weswick's recent legal troubles (he was accused by three women of sexual assault in November 2017) put season two in question. BBC2's announcement of the second season was before this news broke. I am not sure if the show will survive without Weswick, it does center on him despite his character's unappealing antics. Why he couldn't have been just a con man is beyond me, extending his sleaziness to his personal life wasn't necessary unless the intent was to garner hatred towards him.

Obviously it's tough trying to follow up a great series such as 'Inbetweeners' and Damn Beesley didn't do so with 'White Gold,' but even mediocre BBC shows can be worth watching. This is one of them, just don't expect too much..."
White Gold,Enjoyable eighties nostalgia comedy,"This is an enjoyable easy watch with many laughs, sometimes vulgar under the belt. A little trashy and filled with eighties nostalgia. There is no refinement, subtleties or finesse. Just raw spot on cynical comedy without political correctness. Be warned.

It is a fun way to spend some time off watching this if you have lots of free time to fill. Each episode is also short so easy watch now and then.

Some might love this kind of humour, others will be a bit offset by the crude style and dialogue.

Update 010619: After"
White Gold,The 'T. O. P. M. A. N.' in full effect,"UPDATE ON S2 - 07/04/20

Just completed S2, again brilliantly written and cast, capturing that quintessential 80's theme of 'veneer of shinyness coating over what was crap underneath'. The addition of Jo as a foil to Ed Westwick's character was a master stroke. As things ended in ep 6, there's more than enough room to commission S3, go on BBC, you know you want to!

#####

The title here alludes to one of the tracks off Blur's album the 'Great Escape'. I couldn't help when watching this to have the lyrics to that particular track waltz around my brain.

Essex, the early eighties complete with XR3i's, perms and stilettos (white) for the ladies, Sony Walkmans and (improbably) UPVC windows that the title of said sitcom alludes to.

The central character is a suave, roguish (caddish?) chancer who upon being relieved of his employment sees an opportunity to 'make it big' selling Windows. It's difficult not to be charmed by the actors portrayal, plus the excellent supporting cast (in-betweeners anyone) make their ensuing escapades both hilarious and occasionally tragic.

I'm hoping the BBC will look to make a Series 2, as a license fee payer I endorse!"
White Gold,Wolf Of Wall Street meets Only Fools & Horses,What else can I say? It's the perfect marriage of Only Fools & Horses with Wolf Of Wall Street.
White Gold,Good for nostalgia,If you loved the 80s and 80s music then you will probably enjoy this programme. There's quite a few catchy 80s songs that plays throughout the episodes. It does take you back to that time. The script could be a bit funnier though. The main guy isn't really likable as he cheats on his wife. But I still enjoy the show as I like the actors from the inbetweeners. Plus it's nice to go back in time for half an hour!
White Gold,"Retro like Stranger Things, Funny like Inbetweeners","Ok, so it's easy to compare something to The Inbetweeners, especially when it stars two of their cast (Joe Thomas and James Buckley), but the humour is pretty much the same in many parts. It's almost like we're watching Jay and Simon live out their lives in the 80s after finding a time machine and getting stuck back there. The attention to historical detail is brilliant, and the soundtrack is awesome if you love the 80s vibe. If you were a child of the 80s, you will definitely spot the little added bits of detail - Look In magazine, Little Chef, various logos, cars, technology of the time - the set designers have worked hard on this. Overall, don't take this too seriously, it's good, solid, British comedy at its dirtiest, and it's here to make you laugh. Roll on Season 2, which is currently filming!"
White Gold,Easy watch but nothing special,A good easy watch to pass the time with the odd laugh out loud moment. Fails to match Joe Thomas and James Buckley's previous roles.
White Gold,Yeah... Needs some work,"Full disclosure - At the time of posting this, I've only seen the first two episodes. And, listen... I get the whole ""anti-hero"" thing. But shouldn't the protagonist be at least SOMEWHAT likeable? Like, a smidge, maybe? I mean, Deadpool is funny and self-deprecating and even occasionally helps others.

But, don't worry, peeps! I'm solution-oriented. Get rid of Ed Westwick and the whole ""Vincent"" character, and bring in Simon Bird and/or Blake Harrison to play a character is actually funny. You're welcome, show!"
White Gold,Yea BBC/NetFLix,"Loved it. Laughing out loud S1 Ep1 and laughing harder ins S2 Ep6. The chemistry between the three salesmen and the wives and the other women was perfect. Maybe I liked it so much because we don't have anything remotely as funny in America. I wish there were many more episodes to come. I also think America should introduce the word ""wanker"" into the American language. I can think of so many people I could use that word on. The best episode was S2 E1 especially when the two salesman were making fun of Walshy's sales efforts on behalf of w.windows. I laughed so hard, I dribbled tea out of my mouth and down the front of my shirt. Thank you BBC/Netflix."

RV,A LOT better than I expected,"The trailer does this film no justice. My family wanted to see it and I must admit it looked pretty stupid from the commercials. I've always liked Robin Williams though and went along for the ride. It turned out to be a vacation trip full of laughs.

The entire theater was howling throughout the movie. Williams was at his quick witted best and the entire cast just seemed to fit the film. Granted, this is a ""roll with the comedy"" kind of film. There may be a little bit too much ""potty"" humor, but it isn't anything raunchy like Wedding Crashers or other films aimed at teens. This is good for the entire family and will have them all laughing.

Some of the plot and a few of the jokes are telegraphed from a mile away but the strength of the performances and a troop of likable characters transform it from a film you merely wouldn't regret watching to one you'll actually enjoy."""
RV,Better than Its Reputation,"I take my younger daughter to the movies every Friday night, along with another dad and his girl. The movies are chosen to be kid friendly. and so 'RV'was selected. This particular evening the other dad's girl friend was with us.

The adults were resigned to a glum two hours of tedium, but - surprise! Surprise!! - it turned out to be kinda fun. No one will confuse it with Citizen Kane, but it was lively, funny, and not at all boring. It is obviously a pay check movie for everyone involved - but they are all solid professionals and deliver the goods. I was particularly interested that Kristin Chenoweth, the Broadway star, was in the cast.

Sp we had a good time with this movie, which is really all you ever ask on Friday night. The entire case does an ensemble version of 'Route 66' over the closing credits, which is worth staying for."
RV,Give Robin Williams a break...,"R.V

My rating: 6.5/10

I went to see this movie with extremely low expectations, thanks to all the negative predictions which had been circulating for the past few weeks, and I have only one thing to say; DO NOT avoid this movie only because your favourite critic has said that it is an unprecedented flop, or because you think the title is unappealing  watch the movie for yourself first, and be the judge yourself without being influenced by any other guy who probably hasn't even seen the film. Only then you will realise the true significance of this movie.

First off, it's a great movie to watch with the whole family, which is saying something since most of the comedy movie nowadays are filled with raunchy jokes from start to finish (not that I don't enjoy those movies, but it's cool to watch a nice simple family movie every now and then  ""The Pink Panther"" is a good example of the latter). Contrary to rumours, Robin Williams does NOT let us down, in fact I think he is just as funny as he was in his previous flicks  and if some obsessively observant viewers do notice a change in his performance, then give the guy a break, he's getting older he isn't what he used to be 10 years ago!

I think it's a pretty good movie mind, it isn't a piece of genius but as I said, if you wipe out all biased thoughts from your mind before watching this flick and without the skeptical attitude, there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie as much as I did, just give it a try."
RV,Well-paced silliness passable if you're in the mood,"I was in the mood for something stupid and silly. RV filled the bill, mostly because of Cheryl Hinds and the Goernike family (headed by Kristen Chenowith and Jeff Daniels). The dumb singing alone moved things along well enough. Robin Williams never believed his own character which is hard-to-take from a film's lead. And his boss, the film's ostensible villain, was a zero.

On the plus side are the film's pacing, the Goernike's, Cheryl Hinds, and three strokes of brilliance by Williams amongst a lot of glib throwaways. To its credit, RV never bogs down by taking itself too seriously or by trying to convince the audience it has an actual plot beyond its absurd trappings. Director Sonnenfeld has an amusing cameo as Irv."
RV,"""RV"" is a silly and fun road trip comedy for the entire family.","Bob Munro (Robin Williams) has been planning to take his wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines) and his two children Cassie (JoJo) and Carl (Josh Hutcherson) to Hawaii. But at the very last minute his boss Todd Mallory, (Will Arnett) calls him up and tells him that the biggest sales pitch of his career is going to happen in a few days. Bob gets the idea that if he rents an RV, he can take his family across country to Colorado on vacation and also attend this business meeting. Funny and bizarre moments ensue

Going into ""RV"" I didn't know what to think about it but when I walked out of it just about an hour or so ago I must admit I liked it quite a bit. ""RV"" is a family road trip comedy, a genre made famous by ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" While no one will come out of this film feeling that they saw an original comedic masterpiece. I think if you look at it for what it is, a silly family comedy, you will be able to enjoy it. Personally, I found the film to be very amusing, more so than most others in the theater. There is just something about Robin Williams' comedic facial expressions that make me chuckle.

The whole idea of this rich upper class family traveling in an RV is just amusing. You can't picture this class of people taking a road trip which is why this film is funny. The film features some really strong laughs including the scene where Bob tries to drive the RV over the mountain. I won't deny for a second, that there isn't much thinking involved when watching this film because that is clearly out of the question. But honestly some of the stuff that happened in this film is extremely amusing and I think in this case, it's amusing because it was over the top. Unlike most comedies when they try to drag out a joke, it doesn't work but in ""RV"" the longer the joke goes, the funnier it gets in my opinion.

I also like how this film at times left it up to the audience's imagination. There are a couple of scenes that would have been really stupid and wouldn't work if they actually showed what was happening. The whole raccoon scene is a perfect example of this. I also like that although the humor was very low brow, it wasn't over done. What I mean by that was the jokes are funny but they are somewhat spaced out. Not like with ""Scary Movie 4"" where you have a new joke every other minute.

It's nice seeing Robin Williams come back and do comedy. I personally think he is one of those actors who can do both comedy and drama. He played the father figure very well here and like I said his facial expressions are always amusing. Also his little rap that he did in this film was hilarious. Robin is truly a talented actor. As for the rest of the cast, they were all fine was well. JoJo, who I actually never seen in a film before, was decent as the rebellious daughter and Josh Hutcherson was good as the rap loving son. Cheryl Hines who played Robin Williams wife Jamie was also good. Also a very amusing appearance by Jeff Daniels was also a lot of fun; he really knows how to play those redneck characters.

Barry Sonnefeld was the director of ""RV"" and I am not sure what to think of him. While some of his films are good, some of them are not. It's hit or miss with his films. I personally like the fact that a lot of his films including ""RV"" have the dark comedic touch to them, I pick up on these things and I seem to be one of the few people laughing when this happens but hey I find dark humor to be amusing. Mr. Sonnefeld does a good job in the directing chair here and he really creates all these weird and awkward obstacles that the Munro family has to overcome. Also the way he never allows the film to become overly sappy with family moments is also a nice touch.

So in the end, ""RV"" is a fun time. It's not a masterpiece by any means but just a funny little comedy that most members of the family can enjoy. Robin Williams steals the show the entire film and I feel without him involved this movie would have been really bad. When you see this movie, just take it for what it is, a silly family road comedy. If you take it for what it is, you shouldn't be disappointed. This movie is just like the trailer and TV spots lead you to believe so if you like the television spots or trailer, see this movie. ""RV"" is a movie where you should be able to have a few hard laughs and be able to smile the entire time.

MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""RV"" is a 7/10."
RV,"Crazy, wacky disgusting adventure","I really needed this. The day before I saw this movie I saw one movie that was terrible and one that was good but depressing. That's what happens when you're cheap and you just watch what's on, even if you use a DVR to see it later. And with this movie, a DVR or other recording device is essential. You want to see everything happen. Or maybe you don't. I don't recommend eating while you watch this.

Robin Williams doesn't do his best work here, but if all you want is to see this master play a normal father with the ability for the slapstick and stand-up styles of comedy, you couldn't do much better. His presentation in Boulder is brief but amazing. There's a second presentation that is also quite good but not ideal for a business professional; it's more suited to, say, a corny movie that teaches a moral lesson. And he does the normal father scenes quite well.

JoJo Levesque is ideal as a spoiled teenager who learns what is important in life and can even show a mature side. She starts out (what-EVER) as quite a contrast to the adorable Erika-Shaye Gair we saw a few minutes earlier. And she can SING! You have to stay around for the closing credits. Not everyone in this cast has singing talent, but she does.

Cheryl Hines is quite likable and amazingly tolerant. And she looks good here. I think the difference is she doesn't smile much. She doesn't have much to smile about. But when she does, it's not that gigantic smile.

Kristin Chenoweth makes the most of her role as the matriarch of the annoying Gornicke family that keeps showing up to make our heroes miserable. You have to like her, unless you're the Munros. She looks great and isn't ashamed to show off her ... chest. She has a magnificent singing voice and even shows her operatic talent in performing something corny.

Jeff Daniels is likable and actually intelligent. For his role, I would have expected someone more like Organ Stew Guy. He was introduced at a time when poor Bob needed someone with brains to clean up the literal mess made by the bumbling Howie and Joe Joe. But for the annoying rednecks, I didn't think intelligence would be required. I was wrong, and he plays a great character.

I've mentioned music several times. There's a lot of good music here. Most of it is instrumental country music, but I don't need words to enjoy it. When there are words, they are mostly the silly words that you would expect kids to hate. Hines doesn't mind being silly and embarrassing her kids, who have their own ""music"" (it doesn't qualify).

Colorado has magnificent scenery. I can't say enough about it. North Carolina's mountains are beautiful, but I don't think we have anything to compare to this. And yet the credits mention Canada. So this is actually Canada? Wherever it is, it's enough to drive home the lesson this family has needed to learn. Who needs Hawaii? Utah's not bad either. Great rock formations. For some reason, no trees grow until you reach the border.

And we do learn some important lessons here. We have the evil boss who doesn't seem to care about family and probably wouldn't appreciate nature either. And Laird, the young upstart who might replace Bob who has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Brilliant, but no people skills. So once it becomes clear people like this aren't the ones you should consider important in life, our heroes find out what really makes life worth living.

Is it appropriate for the whole family? Of course. If your family likes potty humor. I can see some strict parents not wanting their kids anywhere near this. But it's a fun adventure if you can handle it."
RV,It is like 'Family Vacation' meets 'Cheaper by the Dozen 2',"In 'RV' Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a business executive who is trying to get in touch with his family. Problem is, he is not cool anymore and is out of touch. Suddenly, he has to the family vacation plans from Hawaii to Colorado; else he could lose his job. So the idea is rent an RV and go driving, and that is where the fun begins.

It is refreshing to see Robin Williams back in the comedy seat. He is truly the life of this film. Unfortunately, he is probably the only funny one in the movie. I can not say it was that good; it is like 'Family Vacation' meets 'Cheaper by the Dozen 2'. Not entirely original, but there are some fun moments with the RV.

I did like the Gornickes (Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth), they were a little too unbelievable, but they did have a good report with Robin Williams. I think both Robin Williams and Jeff Daniels should do more projects together."
RV,Lots of Fun,"The movie's advertising poster somehow made me think this film was going to be like the Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz classic, The Long, Long Trailer, a movie I had long loved. As it turns out, this film really wasn't like that one, but I enjoyed it anyway. While it was loaded with sometimes predictable slapstick comedy and was kind of heavy on potty situation jokes (but definitely not entirely, there was adult humor, too), there were some lines in there that were really great, particularly the ones uttered by Joanna Levesque (whose delivery was such that I found myself laughing again over some of her lines when I thought about them later), who played the daughter, and who was beautiful, by the way. Cheryl Hines as the wife had some great lines, too, and I enjoyed her quirky beauty and great personality. Josh Hutcherson, whom I first saw and enjoyed in Zathura, playing the son in this movie, is revealing himself to be quite a good actor, and I see that he has been cast in the upcoming film based on the award-winning children's novel, Bridge to Terabithia, which is likely to be a plum role for him.

Robin Williams in his films can sometimes be irritating, but he can also be extremely funny, particularly in the way he uses his voice, and in this film, I didn't think he was ever irritating, and I particularly liked his ""hip hop"" or ""homeboy"" routine in this film.

I mostly enjoyed this movie for the pleasure of being with the people in it, including all members of the Gornicke family, whose generosity of spirit I appreciated, and I thought they had a real cool bus. The truth is that a road trip in an RV like this can be lots of fun for a family, and exploring what America has to offer is a great thing to do. In this film, the stunning ""Colorado"" scenery (really Canada) was quite appealing and made me want to go to the Rockies this summer.

The movie had a great soundtrack and I also noticed some clever sound effects that made the comedy situations even funnier.

All in all, this movie has a great heart and is a lot of fun, and I enjoyed it a lot, as did the audience in the theater when I saw it."

RV,I Am Still Laughing While Writing My Review of This Hilarious Movie,"The executive Bob Munro (Robin Williams) is stressed, feeling threatened of losing his job and his lifestyle, since his abusive boss Todd Mallory (Will Arnett) hired the Stanford's geek Laird (Richard Cox) to work in their soda's company. Bob has promised his wife Jamie Munro (Cheryl Hines), his teenage daughter Cassie Munro (Joanna 'JoJo' Levesque) and his young son Carl Munro (Josh Hutcherson) to spend vacations in Hawaii, but Todd demands him to prepare a presentation and attend a business meeting with the owners of a family company in a merging operation scheduled in the same period. Bob hides the truth to his family, rents a recreational vehicle and tries to convince his dysfunctional family that a road trip to the Colorado Rocky Mountains would be good to bring old values back to their family. After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area, the rookie Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family. They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning, retrieving their forgotten family bonds.

When I decided to watch ""RV"" on DVD, I had lower expectations, but I am still laughing while writing my review. This hilarious movie has many unforgotten sequences, but my two favorites are in the very beginning, when Cassie promises to love her father forever, and when Bob complains that the family watches television in four different apparatuses and needs Internet to communicate among them. This family entertainment has good messages relative to family bonding, pressure in the job and true friends. There are some gross, but also funny scenes, and in the end I really liked this comedy. My vote is seven.

RV,"Entertaining, Funny Film!","Once again, Robbin Williams doing what he does best. It is refreshing to see Williams getting back to his comedy roots. I was kinda reluctant to see this film after reading some of the other User Comments on IMDb...but knowing that Sonnenfeld directed, and of course, Williams in the lead, I knew I had to take the family to see it, and I'm glad I did. My 12 and 13 year old kids, my Wife and myself laughed from beginning to end. Our family could also relate to the ""RV"" lifestyle, as we are RV'rs as well, and it is nice to see a movie made that centers around this ever-growing hobby/lifestyle. Either see the movie now, or wait till it releases on DVD, but see it...you won't be disappointed!"

Rating : Passable and acceptable. The tale will appeal to Robin Williams fans and comedy enthusiasts . Well worth watching ."
RV,Mindless Dreck.,"Robin Williams is like a spastic chipmunk with Tourette's syndrome. It's a complete shame that a wide release of a turd like this equals box office success. All members of the cast must have received their money on the dresser as the producers left the hotel room. I can't believe Robin Willims could be more unfunny. He makes Robert Kline look like George Carlin. Robin has replaced Jerry Lewis as the person who is most out of touch with what is funny. On the plus side, I believe the French will be unveiling a croissant for Robin on their walk of fame. Is Cheryl Hines really this desperate to work in movies. The only thing that could make this movie worse would be if Paris Hilton would show up and try to be dramatic and then she would be consoled by Wanda Cykes wearing a thong and looking for a Brazillian wax. This movie is not only a complete waste of time and theater space, it would have been an improvement if they just ran the trailers on a continuous loop for 90 minutes."
RV,"Critically bad, great for families.","While actual movie critics may call this movie ""unoriginal"" or ""boring"", it will always have a special place in my heart. I've grown up with this movie and I think my family has watched it on every road and camping trip we've gone on. If you're watching RV I don't think your looking for a groundbreaking masterpiece, it's a great family movie that's good for quite a few laughs."
RV,"Love Robin WIlliams, but Not This Movie!","Let me just say that I love Robin Williams. I've gone to his stand up shows, seen almost all of his movies, but this movie just didn't do it (for me). It tried very hard to be funny, but ended up being cheesy and predictable. I think I laughed at one thing, and I can't even remember what it was. I was excited to see GOB and Buster from Arrested Development in it, but that just made me sad that they took off a TV show that actually knew how to deliver comedy. Anyways, if you have little kids, they'll probably love it. If on the other hand you are the select few who enjoy laughing at The Office (UK) and Arrested Development, you probably won't like it."
RV,"No surprises, just a silly road movie... again!","My wife dragged me to this movie and I was planning on completely hating it from the start... but, a funny thing happened on the way to the end of this movie. I actually didn't hate it!! Now, it's nothing special and I would suggest waiting until it's released on DVD, but I did giggle throughout the silly pratfalls and goofiness.

Kristen Chenowith played an over the top redneck wife that came with big hair, ample bosom and too much makeup to boot! Jeff Daniels, always completely likable, didn't back down from his ""Big Texan"" character with hat, boots and thick bushy mustache. They stole the movie, and made it somewhat fun in the process.

Don't go see this movie if you're wanting side splitting laughter, but for an hour and a half of silly fun, it's a nice distraction!

AGAIN, JUST WAIT FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!!! You'll be happy that you did!"
RV,Not good,"This movie isn't one of Robin Williams best, as a matter of fact it's not that good. National Lampoons' Vaction is much better. This is just a remake of the Griswolds but in a over size RV in which seems to more exciting than the movie itself. It has a predicable ending and they won't make a part two, well let's hope not because it will be worse than this one. The movie has a few laughs but when all the laughs are in the trailer then the movie won't do that well. I noticed a few people in the theater were laughing throughout the whole movie, they must have been huge Robin Williams fans. All in all, is worth 6 buck to see it but it's not on my DVD purchase list when it come out in a month or two."
RV,Cheesy Family Fun,Comentario no disponible
RV,Read my full comment.,"Simply put, not even Robin Williams could make this movie funny. If you do decide to go out and see this, it shouldn't be for it's alleged humor, but for the sad but true depiction of today's modern family. A good movie to compare this to would be Christmas with the Krank's, both of which deliver the same amount of stale jokes, and no character development. At no point during the movie did I even chuckle. I am not kidding when I say that I did not laugh the whole time I was there, it almost felt down right stupid. And Coming from a guy who laughs at incredibly stupid commercials this should mean something. I feel cheated out of my money and time. So don't take any chances. Sit down with your family, order a pizza, and rent a copy of National Lampoon's Vacation instead. Trust me on this one."
RV,Family Road Trip,"Would I consider this a classic in the comedy genre? Not even close - but would I say that it is something that you can watch with the whole family and have fun with it? You bet I would say that - especially because I sort of did and both my mom and my nephew loved it - or at least laughed at the appropriate moments.

The one thing that really elevates this: Robin Williams! The energy he has in this... just insane! But this is how he rolled ... no pun intended. Cliches abound and some really cringe worthy moments - but nothing that will turn you away from the movie. Well probably not ... again this is not high brow comedy or pretends to be something it is not! Sit back and enjoy."
RV,Take another road.,"This is perhaps the driest performance I have ever seen from Robin Williams.I might have smiled and almost chuckled a time or two,but this film never once made me laugh.Humor that involves raw sewage just isn't very entertaining to me.As a matter of fact(and I say this with no pun intended),it stinks.I have always thought that Robin Williams is at his best when he is improving,and it just seems here that he was not given enough room to do this.It seems like he is going a little too much by the script.It may not be his worst film ever,but it certainly ranks closer to the bottom of the list than it does to the top of it.I recommend all movie goers steer clear of RV and take another road."
RV,Lots of fun!,"I went to see RV with my husband and my two daughters (5 and 10 years old) and all the family enjoyed it so much... It was FUN. The jokes were smarter than in average American family comedies, though, at the same time, they worked in different levels for different age ranges. Robin Williams was not annoying this time, he was warm and communicate truly desperation. And the weird Gornicke were just adorable. It is an excellent family comedy (a genre that I like a lot, despite the fact that I can't stand other mainstream Hollywood movie genres). I would recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some quality and extremely fun time with his or her family."
RV,Family film surprising good,"Sometimes, you just have to go back to the basics. To make a good movie, you need a short title, a simple plot and a great cast. That is exactly what director Barry Sonnenfeld (""Men In Black"") does in the family comedy ""RV."" When you want to make a movie that is fun for everyone, you just make it fun and stupid. With physical humor, family bickering and a great cast of comedic actors, ""RV"" makes for a film that all ages can enjoy. ""RV"" follows the story of the Munro family. Bob (Robin Williams) is all set and ready for a family vacation. Unfortunately, he is not on good terms with his boss (Will Arnett, ""Arrested Development"") and must cancel the trip to make a business meeting. So, instead of telling his family the truth, he lies to them and rents an RV. Bob, his wife (Cheryl Hines), his really hot daughter (JoJo) and his son pack up and set off to Colorado so Bob can sneak away to the business meeting. The movie is your typical ""everything that can go wrong, will"" movie. Just like ""Armageddon,"" only this movie was good. Along the way, the Munro's meet a crazy, full-time RV family named the Gornicke's. Travis (Jeff Daniels), his wife and his home-schooled kids end up following the Munro's around, no matter how hard Bob and his family try to avoid them. Just like most good comedies, the cast makes this movie work. Daniels and Arnett are hilarious. With their comedic backgrounds, along with the ability to work with other professional talents such as Williams and Hines, help bring in the funny. JoJo is also great playing a hot, snotty teenager, because it's really hard to play one when you are a hot, snotty teenager in real life. And don't worry everyone, there is plenty of fuses, raccoons and outrageous stunts to go around. Because we all know that an RV going 80 mph down a mountain wouldn't go off the curvy dirt road and eventually come to a rolling stop without any of the actors getting hurt. It's simple science people. But this example is the point of the film. It is meant to be a movie you can just sit back and enjoy. I saw the movie with college students with a variety of all ages and everyone there enjoyed the film. To be honest, I had very low expectations coming into the film, but it really impressed me. I was worried about Robin Williams being annoying as he can sometimes be, if you don't believe me, watch ""Robots"" and try not to destroy your TV. So overall, the movie was surprisingly entertaining It has been a while since I have watched a family film I enjoyed. Of course, everyone ends up happy in the end and morals are learned, because we all know being together as a family is important. But, it's still a film that all ages can enjoy. With the cast, the great writing and directing with original moments for a family film, there is nothing wrong about enjoying a film that doesn't involve Will Ferrell or nudity. Don't worry about it being too kid oriented either, there are plenty of adult jokes, innuendo and ridiculous humor that everyone can laugh at. I probably enjoyed this movie more than I would have when I was a kid. It's a solid film, and a lot better than you think it would be. You go Robin! Now remember, no more making movies like ""Death To Smoochy."""
RV,"For a comedy, this just isn't funny",Comentario no disponible
A Second Chance,Powerful drama,"To say much about the plot of Suzanne Bier's film about parenthood would be to risk depriving it of its power - the less you know going in, the better. The film is a succession of well-timed punches to the gut, and the cast is good enough to make the characters' difficult choices understandable. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau carries a lot of the weight of the film, but he's well-supported - May Andersen is impressive as Sanne in her first acting role, and Bier's previous collaborator Nikolaj Lie Kaas does well to avoid making his character a one-dimensional.

Not an easy watch by any means, and not an entertainment, but a very well-made and powerful social drama."
A Second Chance,A Powerful and Heartbreaking Drama with a Moral Issue,Comentario no disponible
A Second Chance,WORTH A SECOND WATCH,"A very good movie. Powerful and unsettling. Very clever plot and great cast makes this an absorbing watch. Any spoilers will definitely spoil this movie so be very careful to avoid them in other reviews.

The moral dilemmas presented here are deep and disturbing. That said, very well handled as one would expect from the Danes.

Highly recommended."
A Second Chance,Dark Danish Morality Tale,"This is one of those films that is very hard to give a synopsis about without doing a major plot reveal. Suffice to say it is about the choices we can make when faced with the 'unthinkable'. It is about how we are able to not only blur the line between right and wrong but also move it completely whilst still, self deceivingly, believing that you are still the good guy.

It is about a married couple Anna and her policeman husband Andreas and how they deal with their own tragedy. This is from director Susanne Bier who brought us 'In a Better World' and 'After the wedding'. She has a keen eye for direction and uses dramatic timing to ramp up the tension but also perfectly timed plot reveals – and there are a fair few here.

It is superbly acted with a striking performance from Maria Bonnevie as the new mum and wife. This is a film that trades on the reveals and twists and as such may not be one to see over again; but it is still powerful enough to recommend and indeed warrant at least one good viewing."
A Second Chance,A film with really good acting,"I think one of the main reasons this film really works is the strong performances from Nicolai Coaster-Waldau, Ulrich Thomsen and Maria Bonnevie. Nicolay Coaster-Waldau plays a husband and a father, Bonnivie his wife. The film give an example of how a ""perfect life"", suddenly can turn into a living nightmare. And how the wrong choices can be devastating for everyone involved. The couple really pull it off in this film. Without their strong presence and convincing characters, the film would not been as good as it actually is. They make it a strong and powerful drama. Othervise the story in the film is very simple, and I must admit, not the strongest and most interesting. It is too straight forward, with few surprises. But the actors make it worth Your while to watch it, and they manage to lift this drama. (Sorry about my English)"
A Second Chance,When the GOOD is as bad as the BAD it become.,"I was not sure about watching this film, but like usual ignoring the critics made me realise how much it was underrated. From the director of the Oscar winning film 'In a Better World'. After that great feat which ignited her international career, quite did not go well accordingly, including one project in the Hollywood. So she went back and made this Danish thriller-drama. Very strongly written screenplay, but feels it has flaws and then on its progress, they had all patched so brilliantly to make you think yourself you had got so wrong. It was not based on any book, but looks it could make one fine.

This is a story of 'the good' and 'the bad', and when 'the good' turns very bad, what would 'the bad' decide to do. A decent middle class couple who can do anything for their newborn child and another couple who are drug addicts whose newborn was completely neglected. When the tragedy strike in one of these families, the nightmare begins for another. A series of events follows where they all go for an extra mile to get a second chance. So see it to believe what people are capable when they are in the desperate situation.

Like the title and its tagline indicating, the narration carefully and intensely built the plot in the first act. That is the part you have to be watchful to learn the characters which is obviously a bit slower than the rest of the film. In the second half where it all turns to one direction to move on with a couple of quick twists. Totally unpredictable stuffs, because they were silly or maybe kind of familiar and you won't expect that to happen, but it does. I think that was the very clever, beside the powerful performance had brought a good balance between the pace and the contents of the film.

""People look different when they are dead. That's just how it is.""

It did not win any big awards internationally or contended for the Oscars, but still the film is worth a watch. No matter what the critics say, this is one of the best films of the year. Like I said the story might look stupid in the paper, but the filmmakers stunning presented it on the screen. I won't be surprised if an improvised versions were made in other languages including Hollywood. After those fine progress it made in the middle part, the conclusion was somewhat ordinary. It suddenly skips a couple of years forward with one final short scene before the credits roll up which will make us feel good. That was a nice way to end after the shock the narration had given to us.

From the actors, Nikolaj Coaster-Wakdau was the screenpace ruler and did not fail to deliver. If this film is winning an award means he should be on the top of the list from the film followed by the direction and screenplay. In one of the film posters he just looks alike the current James Bond, the film was a lot better than the impression the posters give. His co-stars were not bad either.

There is sentiment in it, but not that effective, so the lack of melodrama is the big drawback. A theme like this should have bettered that part in order to make the overall film even better. Because the characters do not count when the subject it dealing with was has much higher priority. So the viewers always would be busy looking for what might happen to the story rather thinking its characters all the time. And that is because of the neutrality. Like I said before when 'the good' is as bad as 'the bad' it become, then everything end in an equal position and you might stop backing anyone particularly. There are many films like this, but this is kind of refreshing and very realistic. Definitely, I must end my review recommending it. So I hope you all enjoy it as I did.

A Second Chance,excellent Danish film,We were left speechless at the end of this film. great story and acting. perfect danish film.
A Second Chance,So sad,"Wow it was just one deep, sad thing after another. But a well acted good movie. Cross between a thriller and drama, don't watch it if you can't deal with bad things happening to babies."
A Second Chance,Major disappointment,"Firstly, I found the storyline pretty ridiculous. As much as I tried, I couldn't get my head past that stumbling block. I felt the screenplay was weak and the acting straight out of first year drama school. The characters and their lines and reactions just didn't add up. I was the only person in the theater - but that was 10.30 on a Sunday nite. In my opinion, this was only fit for TV not a movie house. It was instantly forgettable. I suppose they could put it on long haul flights. I really would like to be more complimentary - I was in the mood for a hard hitting and gripping drama, but sadly this missed the mark. Watch it on Netflix or when it comes round on TV. To me, this was written by a 16 year old as a piece to get themselves into some kind of movie school. Sorry."
A Second Chance,Changeling,"Great drama,thriller, I'm finding that these foreign films are so well crafted,...this is a hidden gem for sure....."
A Second Chance,Well Directed and Acted Drama,"Initially I thought that the movie is a slow pace drama with no substance except acting, but I must the later half of the movie was too good to avoid. Few scenes were marvelous and the truth in the end set me free. Morality comes from within and if you are good, you will do good in the end."
A Second Chance,I Should've Been Warned This Was Melodramatic Nonsense.,"The difference between this film and a soap opera is soap operas have commercials; everything else is the same: same overacting, same dragged out angst, same frequent crocodile tears, same melodramatic claptrap. This film is listed as a thriller. It isn't. It's pure soap opera fluff situated in Denmark. Nice scenery, though. Can't complain about that."

A Second Chance,A heart-rending story about parenthood and loss in today's Copenhagen.,"This is a really sad film, directed by one of the most prominent female Danish directors, Susanne Bier (''Brothers'', ''The Night Manager'', ''In a Better World'') and starring an all-star cast with names such as Ulrich Thomsen, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. There is also a brief appearance by Peter Haber, known mainly from the legendary ''Beck'' television series and the cinema adaptation of the first Stieg Larsson's novel in the ''Millenium'' trilogy (''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo''). The story revolves around Andreas (Coster-Waldau), a police officer who is facing a tragedy in his personal life as he loses first his infant son in an accident and after awhile his wife commits suicide leaving him alone and desperate. Andreas will kidnap the son of a junkie couple and in a way, try to replace his dead offspring with the, neglected by his real parents, baby. This is a slow-burning movie which retains its suspense and interest as far as the main abduction plotline is concerned, but emphasizes on the characters' emotions and reactions, specifically focusing on Andreas tormented soul and the viewer finally identifies with a baby kidnapper, a difficult achievement for a crime film. Susanne Bier is an experienced and talented auteur who prompts the audience to ponder on the film's main themes, that is the question of what really is a good parent and the nature of grief as well as its dire consequences to the human beings. This is a film that will appeal mainly to European audiences and it is nothing like the typical films of the crime genre that the American audiences -mainly- are used to. So, if you are expecting tons of actions or high levels of suspense, better skip it. If, on the other hand, you believe that entertainment is something more than mere enjoyment, try to watch ''A Second Chance'' (original -Danish- title: ''En chance til'') pronto."
A Second Chance,A goodish film,"I like looking at Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's face and this film affords LOTS of opportunities to do that. He does not disappoint. The story is far from believable, BUTTT is nonetheless entertaining and has twists and turns that are absorbing. Well acted, well directed. Sub-titles, but well done. And if you have Prime it's commercial free and sort of 'free.' Go for it."
A Second Chance,Picturesque Drama,"I think this is a very good film, but I can understand how it struck negative chords with kevjfarrell (see the above review). There is a pedestrian quality about the plot. In some places we can almost imagine the filming of a scene. Transitions are seamless, but they have a seemingly manufactured quality about them. Perhaps it is all a matter of a frame of mind. Perhaps I am tired of guns, noise, furious action and the hyperventilating in today's popular entertainment. So I just let myself go and became immersed in the drama.

I disagree with Mr Farrell in regards to the acting. Far from seeing it as sophomoric posturing for entry into film school, I found it natural, gripping and well-paced. In a word, realistic.

I have noted that photography has not been mentioned in the above reviews. The camera is very much a part of this film. The cinematography contains a full pallet of colour and texture with intriguing, grainless resolution and depth of field. Scenes shift between chromatic hues to almost monochrome where light and shadow replace contrasting colour. You are neither jarred nor bullied by these changes. There is a gentleness, which is complimentary to the subject.

The argument in the film is staged by gentleness vs violence, understanding and compassion vs reactive predilection. It is difficult to rate this film on a purely technical level. It could be rated less than my 8, and it could be rated more highly. I'll settle on 8 and just say that I am very glad I watched this film, and I hope to watch it again. I recommend the Danish version with subtitles."
A Second Chance,A good Drama/thriller,"Well built film. Although the writer forced the situation of the baby's non-identity recognition, it did not detract from the plot as a whole. Except for this issue, which I attribute as a minor flaw in the script, the other facts show a credible and acceptable logic even for fiction. The film's narrative is intriguing and leaves the viewer anxious for what is to come. I enjoyed watching it and recommend it as entertainment."
A Second Chance,A really good movie,"One of the best films I've ever seen!!

I was completely hooked by this movie... The acting is of very high quality and the story is very very good."
A Second Chance,Human drama can hardly get more explosive,"Human drama can hardly get more explosive and heartfelt than in this Susanne Bier film, which is propelled forward by Anders Thomas Jensen's artful script and intense, remarkable performances by a great cast, but particularly Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. He plays a policeman who must try to save an infant from a junkie couple while at the same time dealing with domestic problems concerning a depressed wife and some issues with their newborn baby. The ensuing events grip your sense of ethics and shake it quite ferociously before leaving you to pick up the pieces in co-operation (or sympathy) with Coster-Waldau's character. This is timeless, pure filmmaking of Bergmanesque proportions."

13 Reasons Why,Don't bother with season 3,First season brilliant. Second was alright but the third is awful. You can't add a new character and make her the main part. I hate her and can't watch it because of her. Going by other reviews I'm not the only one. Whoever wrote her part needs punishing
13 Reasons Why,Thank you for 13 Reasons why,I just wanted to thank the crew and actors for making this show possible! I am a grown man and I was very emotional during the whole series (more so during the first season what happened to Hannah) but it really got me emotionally. I think it was the most emotional show I watched in my life! I normally don't write these but bravo to everyone part of this show!

13 Reasons Why,Did the creator and producers really care after season 1?!,"13 Reasons Why started strong, interesting and haunting in its first season, having me on the edge of my seat and fully interested at all times. It was super gripping, well-done & well-acted and by the end of that season, I couldn't stop thinking about it, highly praising and recommending it for quite a while. Then the subsequent seasons followed and the magic vanished pretty quickly, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.

Season 1 gets a 10, It was the best and should have finished there.
Season 2 gets a 7.5, explored the aftermath, while having filler scenes of Hannah Baker, not doing justice to her in a decent way.
Season 3 gets a 5, the writers ran out of ideas, dragging the series and adding an outsider character by the name of Ani, not making any sense in the series, let alone her deceitful personality, unpleasant presence and distasteful acting.


All executives involved, forgot about the real story of the series, about Hannah Baker and how she was martyrized and battered. They forgot about her pain, suffering and hopelessness, which got to my throat and saddened me beyond measure.

A continuation and dragging of a series mainly about Hannah Baker and her issues, without her being in it and an active part of it, was most unforgivable. I loved Liberty High and its life, but without Hannah in it, it was just a shadow of a life.

Hannah, you were traumatized beyond measure, made a point at the expense of your life and will be dearly missed. Hope that other persons like you, out there, find the courage and strength to speak up before it's too late."
13 Reasons Why,season 4 broke my heart.,"I was going through a massive depression, i thought i was the only one who was suffering, this show helped to get through my depression and made me stronger. Thank You 13RW. I love you Justin."
13 Reasons Why,Season 4 was NOT how this should have ended!,Comentario no disponible
13 Reasons Why,"If you are just thinking of watching this, stop after season 1.","Disappointed is all I'll say. People may disagree but this is honestly how I feel about the show.

Season 1 was 9/10 for me. Brilliant season. The shock factor made this show stand out. It felt like a refreshing presentation of not very commonly talked about situations. I do advice a little discretion if you're going through a tough time as it can have negative effects inadvertly. The show should have ended right here, and no one would've complained.

Season 2 is a drag. A very huge dip. It still ties to the main story but draws a lot of different branches, each of which explore the main plot from Season 1. Still watchable.

Little ""extra"" details ahead: Season 3 is a disaster in my honest opinion and hence you see the earlier 9/10 become a 3/10. I don't want to spoil anything exactly, hence I can't give away precise details. The third season doesn't even feel like 13 Reasons Why. It is so overly obsessed with ""who does what"" and ""who is it"" over 12 episodes while contributing contents of character development which doesn't even get utilized in the 13th (finale) episode. There's a new randomly introduced character and that character is supposedly someone the viewer should care for, for some odd reason. They tried character development to impact the viewer's perspective, but I feel like the execution was poor.

Season 4, here we go. Not as big a disaster as Season 3. I've seen people hate it and I totally understand why. The season is weirdly paced. Sometimes it feels dragged, sometimes it feels forced. There's too much unnecessary information again. What started off with the first season has zero relevance to this season, at this point. That being said, I think it's good to see them wrap it up. It could've been worse. Coming out of season 3, I didn't know what to think. But it is not as worse as I imagined it to be. It's still below average in my opinion, but at least they concluded the story without making an even bigger mockery of it. The emotional touch at the end did influence my opinion on the season.

9/10 for the first season. 6/10 for the second season. 2/10 for the third season. 3/10 for the fourth season.

5/10 for the whole 4 seasons.

Dylan (who played Clay) was great throughout the series. Katherine Langford did a really good job with potraying Hannah. Tyler, Justin and Bryce were well acted out too.

The show had a very limited shelf life. The show should've ended with Hannah's story. I think the creators should've acknowledged this simple fact. The story fell apart as the timeline progressed, even though the acting was top notch. It's a shame. Regardless, the first season of the show will always stand out to me. It will always be one of my favourite seasons of any show. Anything after that? I'd probably avoid."

13 Reasons Why,Should have been one season only,"Season one was great. If you've heard good things about this show, it's more than likely things being said about the first season. The second season is okay but not as good, and then the last two are pretty bad. They're entertaining don't get me wrong-but in some of the worst ways possible. In my opinion, it turned into a show where they were exploiting serious issues just for shock value and to keep the show running-as opposed to addressing those issues and tackling them with a storyline that makes coherent sense."

13 Reasons Why,Impactful series on this generation of teenagers,Dylan Minnette absolutely shines in these series and most of the cast delivers a solid performance. While each season differs from one another it tells a compelling story on how actions of a few can impact the lives of many. The variety of character is well executed by Brian Grazer who adopted the book this is based on to the television screen and gives fresh variety of issues teenagers might be dealing with in their every day lives. The final season is on par with the first season but falls a little bit short during the middle with bizarre scenes and out-of-context scenes that have little or no impact to the general storyline. The final episode is absolutely heartbreaking and I advice watchers to have tissue ready. One of my all time favorite TV series in a long time. Enjoy.
13 Reasons Why,Powerful powerful show,"The first thing I want to say before I start, is that I do not binge watch TV series. It's extremely rare for me, and I often don't even finish the season. This TV series had me hooked from start to finish and I spent all day watching it.

While I was watching I was thinking - this is absolutely brilliant TV. However, by then end of it, I was thinking - that was so powerful and emotional to watch. I could barely watch the final few episodes, because I was so engrossed in the story and it does becomes quite graphic. I will say no more.

Easily the best TV series I have watched in many many years, and an absolute must watch show."
13 Reasons Why,Season 1 YES! Season 2 Eh. Season 3 No No No.,"I came here to write a review specifically about the character Ani, but upon seeing previous reviews, there's nothing left to be said. The show apparently needed a voice in the background because Hannah isn't there to do it, so they introduce us to a RANDOM character and make us believe she was included in this very VERY closed off group because...that's exactly how high school works, right? Love the actress, hated the character. This show turned teen detective very quickly, and the main story line is everyone is lying about something, but what clue can us teen detectives find at the end of each episode to bring truth to a lie. Every time.

I DO have to say something about the cinematography and lighting and editing. That was awesome and these poor teams hardly get credit. The seamless transitions to flashbacks worked like, for the lack of a better term, like magic. You watch a character walk away, but in the same shot as the lighting changes see the character emerge again in the flashback. Standing ovation for that. I loved it."
13 Reasons Why,"Raw, painfully blunt, and brutally honest","How strange it is for me to say this, but I hope they don't make a second season for this show. It ended exceptionally well, with beautiful one-liners and a soundtrack that was thematically symmetrical to the harsh reality presented in the show. The lighting, the flashbacks, the narration was pitch perfect. I love how the producers kept true to the book, developing the story peripherally as I expect they had to do, to make thirteen hour-long episodes, but they left the main plot untouched and untarnished.

Everyone who has been through high school knows that it isn't easy. Everyone who has contemplated taking their own lives knows isolation, knows a million streams of thought blazing by, knows about grasping at signs and the slimmest of hopes. The story presented here is so unapologetic and raw, so real that the viewer is left reeling from their own moral compasses flickering. Are we so innocent? It takes less than a moment to reach the conclusion that no one is innocent.

The acting is superb and convincing. The actors and actresses ages are finally reflected honestly in a young adult / coming of age show. I think everyone knows someone who has gone through some of the problems presented in the show which makes it so relatable. And although it doesn't give us any solid resolve to these challenges, just as in life, we go on."
13 Reasons Why,New Girl Sucks!!!!,"I have seen 2 episodes of S3 and I cannot stand Ani...It took 2 seasons to understand all the characters and they are giving more screentime to the new chick, it doesn't work that way."

13 Reasons Why,How valuable is a human's life?,"I watched the last episode and finished the series. My current mood is depressive and my feathers thorns. It was really impressive. The drama brings great sorrows to the audience, bringing sadness. It completely changes the way people think about their behavior towards the environment. We have behaviors that cause negative effects that we do not care about people we interact with, and that is to realize that our behavior can be one of the giant pieces of fist that are thrown into the life of that person. The worst do not care about it. So I always thought it was important to pay attention not to break your heart in this life. It is very important to act like human beings. This series is for everyone to watch. Especially parents. The biggest impact of the series was that I could start looking at the people around me with less prejudice. It is strongly recommended. 8/10"

13 Reasons Why,This Ani character has to go,"I have never written a review on here before, but use it religiously when watching something new. For people like me I felt like I needed to write a review about season 3. I am only giving it a four because season one and two were actually good. But season 3 is so disappointing, and makes my rating that low. This new character Ani is horrible! Everything about her is annoying, her voice, her personality, her lies, EVERYTHING. She came out of left field, doesn't even fit with the original characters. She has absolutely nothing to do with Hannah, which was the original point of this show. It's just very disappointing and she should of never been brought into the group."

Love Is Blind: Brazil,Interesting Concept for a Dating Show,"Already saw Love is Blind US version, Love is Blind Japanese Version, and now Love is Blind Brazil Version. Brazil I thought was one of the better shows, season 2 was interesting, although some of the couples were disappointing. My favorite person was actually Shayan although his partner was trying to make him out to be a villain the whole tie - just saw the reunion and she did nothing but trash him which was uncalled for. I always thought that he really fell for her in the pod but she just came across as some kind of brat in the end. Some happy stories, some sad stories, but it is proof that it is definitely an emotional experience for these people that fall in love by putting their phones away, and just talk through the walls without seeing each other - you just end up getting close to someone so much quicker. Interesting concept."
Love Is Blind: Brazil,Better than the American version,Comentario no disponible
Love Is Blind: Brazil,Season 3,"I watched seasons 1 and 2 in the distant past so can't remember enough to comment. Season 1 must have been good, for me to go on to Season 2. Watching season 2 reunion last night reminded me that it was mostly forgettable, with an extremely irritating woman with braids going on to say i do.

Watched Season 3 and it was quite enjoyable. Most of the couples were likeable and were still together. The Brazilian version of this franchise seems sincere and the people who go on it seem to be doing so for genuine reasons, unlike its US counterpart (ugh) Brazil is the first country on my bucket list, and the sweet little tamarins eating fruit and scampering about in the honeymoon location made my heart swell."
Love Is Blind: Brazil,American dubbing is hilarious,The American dubbing is so cringe it is hilarious. Honestly where did they find these voice overs? They put zero effort on trying to sound natural. They are robotic and mono tone. The translation is absolutely dumb but too be honest I watched all and laughing all the way through. Interesting to see the Brazilian version though.
Love Is Blind: Brazil,WATCH SUB NOT DUB,"This show mainly has negative reviews because people can't handle subtitles. Learn Portuguese or watch something else then? I promise you, sub will always be better.

I enjoyed this quite a bit. I found this show to be so much more authentic and entertaining than the American one. Less ""trash tv""."
Love Is Blind: Brazil,English dub and editing,"I'm watching episode 5 and I am kind of over this show. It's so hard to follow. They used one male and one female voice over talent and they sound so unnatural. There's no emotion, no different tones to show that different people are talking and the editing doesn't help. At times, during group conversations it's difficult to tell who is talking. They'll have a wide shot and I'm scanning the screen to find the person talking. Netflix, I dont have experience but I'm confident I can do better."
Love Is Blind: Brazil,Subs over dubs,Look the dub are trash. But the show is way better then the American version I recommend watching it with subs the guns are horrible and at times make the show boring.
Love Is Blind: Brazil,Not Feeling Season 2,"I am a big fan of Love is Blind. I've indulged in the US one and the Japanese version. I also was fully immersed in the first season of Brazil.

I have to say I am struggling with season 2.

Unlike season 1, I find myself battling to become invested in any of the new singles this season.

I've always had my favourites before, and this season I'm just not connecting with anyone involved and have no real care of if they say I do or I don't.

The couples are just bland to say the least.

I've seen people complain about the dubbing, switch it off and watch the subtitles, it really isn't that hard. I don't know why you would want to watch it dubbed anyway.

I've just finished episode 4 of season 2 and am hoping the next episodes pick up and get me more invested.

On another note Season 1 was fantastic, I still go back and google to see who is together and who isn't."
Love Is Blind: Brazil,Ugh subtitles!,"I really enjoyed this show...the pacing was great. The subtitles, however, were difficult to keep up with. I was so busy trying to read the captions, that I missed so much of the nuance and emotion. Totally appreciate the premise and I hope there are more seasons in the future."

Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Knock Knock...F%@k Off.,"While I respect the opinions of those who criticized the show (not surprisingly the comments rated ""least useful""), it appears that their views are so concrete that they just don't get it.

This brilliant series is not intended to reflect the ""reality"" of trailer park life in Nova Scotia, but is instead a wonderful artistic compilation of many extreme, bizarre, and mundane experiences that are interesting on an entertaining and (feigned) voyeuristic basis. There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now ""park operas"".

Consider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act ""in character"" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.

Let's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.

How is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country.

If given a chance, you will see how the brilliance shines through the layers of carefully placed sh#@. It is meant to look amateurish!"
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Julian's drink,Makes me laugh out loud every episode. Every day I think about the episode he climbs out of the car flip with a full drink
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,There is a special sort of charm about this show. Know what I'm sayin'?,"I've been an avid fan of the show for about a decade now. There's an odd charm, a bit of an attraction to the simplicity of the way of life that the characters in the show live, that is oddly alluring. Talk about a fictional, worry-free escape in the world of television, this is the epitome of such a deviation from the real world.

The show follows three main characters: Ricky, who is the completely emotionally-fueled, irrational one of the lot, who constantly puts himself AND OTHERS into horrible and illegal situations, only to shrug it off as ""no big deal"" (one of the show's many running jokes), and tries to pass the blame onto someone else. And then there's Julian, who is often seen as the ""brains"" of the trailer park, but really he's mostly in it for himself, and while his heart in usually in the right place, and it's known he cares about his friends, he often forgets the latter and makes decisions only to benefit himself. He also is never seen without a rum & coke in his hand. And finally, there's Bubbles. A special lad, with an adorable affection for kitties, he's usually the voice of reason between the three, even though he may come off as more ""special"" than his friends. He's the more sympathetic of the trio, and an avid Rush fan. Sometimes, due to the crazy antics of his friends and the lovable psychos of the trailer park, he's often put into unfortunate situations.

And one HAS to give love to the man who plays Jim Lahey, who is the drunk and vengeful supervisor of the trailer park, always looking to get even with ""the boys."" And a special nod goes to J-Roc, one of TV's most hilariously pathetic characters, whose quotes will live on forever,""'naw what I'm sayyin' booiii?"" Seriously, every scene with this character is absolute gold.

The show is absolutely hilarious. The characters are so ridiculous, their ways of life and their mannerisms are so preposterous you can't help but love them. If you can get past all the crude language, that is. And of that, there is a LOT. But the whole show is riddled with brilliant comedy, memorable quotes, and a charming flow.

I absolutely LOVE this show. Especially the first half dozen seasons, before they were picked up by Netflix. I hate repeating myself, but there is such an uncanny CHARM to this show, it's completely irresistible."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,"understated brilliance, continuing the great Canadian comedy tradition","Like most people when I first saw this show I thought it was just another mindless low budget comedy series aimed at the dim-witted pot smokers among us. Then I watched it more and became mesmerized by the underlying brilliance, everything was not as it seemed, from the beautifully languid intro music, to the ingenious documentary style of filming. Much like SCTV, it uses the low budget quality of the show, and turns that into a bonus. THe shaky hand-held camera, the occasional boom mic shot all blend perfectly with the mostly improvised dialogue. There's something uniquely Canadian about this, making the best out of the fewest resources, and it demonstrates the greatness of the show that it does not need huge production values to make you laugh your ass off. And laugh you will as you watch the main characters, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles stumble their way through life. We have all met people like this, much like in the movie ""Fubar"", people who are completely ignorant and emotionally underdeveloped, yet very much content with their position in life. Both Fubar and TPB, the key is not to make fun of these people in a condescending way, look equally at their naive stupidity but also at their loyalty and innocence and genuineness.

The 80's had SCTV, the 90's Kids in the Hall, for Canada, the 00's belong to the Trailer Park boys."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,NO MATTER HOW BAD LIFE IS THIS SHOW FIXS IT!!!,"I advise every human being on earth to watch this show, idc how bad your day has been or what's going on in your life this show will brighten your day and I promise you that you will Laugh and Smile while your watching the Amazing cast, John Dunsworth(Mr.Lahay) is hands down one of my personal favorite actors but this man is a Genius and plays a Drunk person Amazingly and he will be missed o so very much! Bottom Line this show will brighten your day I PROMISE!!!!"
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,"Incredible, brilliant show","Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!! I am trying to spread the word down here in California."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,A Riot,This show is THE funniest damn show ever produced in Canada. What a bunch of dumbasses these characters are! You must see this show. It is the funniest thing. Just a bunch of small town folks living in a trailer park trying to make it. Truly amazing!
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Great show through the first 7 seasons.,Great comedy from Canada. The cast of characters is great and hilarious. Lots of funny moments and seasons. The show was funny but kind of tanked once Netflix brought it back. The movies are pretty good too.
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,A gem that needs to be more recognised,"This is my first review on this site.

This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen.

At first, I was a bit put off from it due to the way they film it. But once I grew on it by watching more episodes, it's actually a brilliant masterpiece.

The characters are very interesting, in a ludicrous way. It's amazing how they continuously make such addictive story lines for such a small environment to work on.

This is very cheaply made but with that in play, a lot of creativity put into such little to play with. That's what mostly makes it brilliant."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,The noblest form of comedy i've ever enjoyed.,"At first, it seems like the trailer park boys is a typical cult comedy you should watch if you want to watch something while high, but as the show keeps going you realize that this show is a masterpiece of classical comedy. Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.

The show is full of many other interesting characters that have their own brand attitude that makes this show so funny and well made. The exaggeration is the main protagonist here, abuse, swearing, dope, gunfights all in a perfect mix of comedy exaggeration. The show wins you by making you love the characters and their exaggerating attitude the outlaw lifestyle and their constants attempts to make a living.

If you love honest comedy, you are going to f-kin love this show. Thumbs up for Canada."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Acquired-Taste Mockumentary is Nearly Perfect,"When most people sit down with Trailer Park Boys Season One, they are going to be confused. It's crude, amoral, and not traditionally funny. It's also a direct continuation of a lesser known movie, which is an even bigger entry barrier to enjoying what turns out to be one of the best comedy series ever made.

Comedy is arguably the most subjective genre in film, and it would not surprise me if many people can't hurdle the walls that this show puts in place.

I have trouble recommending it to a general audience.

However, the brilliance of TPB isn't overt. It's in the subtext, verisimilitude, heart, and attention to detail. Similar to Idiocracy, the dumb-slapstick humor often provides a thick veil that the viewer must push aside to reveal the real comedic backbone of the content.

Most of the funniest stuff in this show isn't said, but rather shown or implied.

The sets and the props, for instance, are incredibly detailed and destitute. There are bits of hilarity strewn through the backdrops of almost every scene that a discerning viewer will notice and get a chuckle from. TPB, particularly in seasons 1-7, is relentless in portraying poverty, criminality, and desperation. This perspective is never broken in the early seasons, and its painfully accurate in many of its non-judgmental representations of people in the lowest rungs of society who are just trying to get-by.

The cast of eclectic characters equally shines here. Everyone in the park has a very distinct personality and reason for existing within the park's ecosystem. Even in the later seasons, when they ramp the silliness up while leaning into caricatures, it's still a joy to watch. There's a certain comfort that the viewer gets with this cast, as if we are also living in the park with them.

And, that's probably the show's greatest success - being a window into the lives of flawed people living in a tough situation, but who are still trying to make the best out of it. There's simply no other show quite like it.

When Netflix (known in the show as SwearNet) took over the show for seasons 8-12, it was eight years after the original series finale aired. Someone, perhaps Mike Smith (Bubbles) who became a primary writer, decided to change some of the portrayals in the show to be extremely over-the-top. Many fans of the original series despise these changes, and refuse to even watch the last five seasons.

However, once one gets used to the cartoony switch of tone, there is plenty of amusement and laugh-out-loud moments to still be had. Though it does feel like Netflix ripped some of the tone and heart from Clattenburg's classic, the show still ends up feeling a cut above other comedies, mostly due to the great character-acting and ridiculous plotlines.

Even though I gave TPB a perfect 10 rating, the show isn't perfect by any means. In my countless viewings, I've noticed some continuity errors and jarring pacing. The five Netflix seasons, specifically, are tonally disconnected from the original series in many ways.

However, the re-watchability of TPB is unlike any show I've ever seen. Many, many shows were influenced by this early mockumentary, and it's obvious why. This is a great binge and an even greater background-show. It's consistently funny and realistic, while still being silly and bombastic.

Nothing is perfect, but for what this show is, nothing could be perfecter.

10/10 Must-Watch."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Funniest show on TV,"My favourite thing about trailer park boys has to be the characters, they are CRAZY, from ricky trying to get his 4th grade to Lahey trying to get the boys thrown in jail.

There is nothing else like it on TV .

Its so surreal and absurd at some points you cant help but wet yourself with laughter. every season is as good as the last including season 6, even though most people say it sucks, COME ON PEOPLE, THE FILM IS OUT IN THE SUMMER! I just hope they keep making this show whether the movie is a success or not.

LONG LIVE TRAILER PARK BOYS!"
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Original seasons good/Netflix seasons not so good,"As my title says, the original 7 seasons that aired on Showcase in Canada from 2001 to 2007 were great. Yes, I even loved season 7, which it seems most other fans of the show don't really like this season, but I do and honestly, compared to the Netflix seasons, you'll appreciate season 7 a lot more. Also, the original TPB The Movie released in 2006 and was pretty good. The show seemed to have ended with season 7 in '07, but of course, fans wanted more of the boys and due to popular demand, a TV movie was released titled Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys, which was pretty great in my opinion. Then another movie titled Countdown to Liquor Day was released the following year in 2009, which was, just Ok, in my opinion, of course. Finally, a 4th movie was released titled Don't Legalize It, which got mixed reviews but I really enjoyed it. Along with this came the announcement that Netflix was bringing the series back and that same year in September of 2014, Netflix released season 8 of Trailer Park Boys. And..., well, honestly, I didn't hate this season. I actually kind of liked it. Though, Mike Clattenburg's (the creator, head writer, and director of pretty much the entire show/movies up until this) absence from the show was very apparent. It was waaaay more over-the-top than it had ever been before, which was definitely a bad thing...ya know....in my opinion. But it wasn't terrible. However, we then come to season 9 released on Netflix on March 27th 2015 and...dear god, season 9 was just...it was so bad. It was so, so bad. I hated it so much. I found myself cringing so often and maybe let out a slight chuckle here and there. I know as shows go on, characters always tend to become caricatures of themselves, but this was ridiculous. In prior seasons, Ricky was at least capable of speaking at a normal volume sometimes. In this season, he pretty much screams every single word he says. The whole season is just bad. And season 10 is even worse. Not much to say other than it's just god-awful. It feels like it's trying so so hard to be over-the-top and give shock-humor but it's just bad in every way. Seasons 11 and 12 were definitely a huge step up from the previous 2 before it but still nothing great. Seasons 1-7 were peak TPB for me and I'm sure most fans of the show would probably agree."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,I just don't get it.,"Season One: 3/10

Themes: Trailer Park, Comedy, Ex-Cons, Drugs, Petty Crime, Friendship, Stupidity & Canadian.

Review: I really do not understand the appeal of this show. It's about a bunch of complete idiots, doing nothing but scream at each other, swear like there's no tomorrow, fire off guns as if it's their new favourite toy, and be drunk all the damn time. It just wasn't funny and I didn't laugh even once. The characters were extremely annoying to the point of me rolling my eyes at them every episode. The plot itself is also super uninteresting; it's the same thing over and over again, and besides being repetitive, it was very boring in and of itself. I'm definitely not a fan. Perhaps I'm missing something here, but I just don't see what would be entertaining about this series. It was just silly and ridiculous."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,It grows on you,"When I first left a review of this show I was fairly unimpressed with it. However, since then I've forced myself to watched the entire Seasons 1-3 and I have to say it: man, was I wrong.

It grows on you. If you can get over the bad acting and the political incorrectness you'll find one hell of a show. As another reviewer said it's not an accurate reflection of life in a Nova Scotia trailer park: more like if you took the weirdest members of every trailer park in NS and put them together to dumb it up.

Some of the funnier aspects I've found have been Ricky's constant mispronunciations (there are at least then in every episode), Mr Lahey's constant sh*t analogies, and, of course, Bubbles, who makes even the bad episodes worth watching.

If you give it a chance you won't have a single favourite episode; more like a collection of favorite moments pulled from each ep. Whether it's J-Roc's identity crisis (""I hate to admit it ... I'm white""), Bubbles' dragging a drunken Ricky home in the back of his go-cart, or the visit from the hysterically creepy Bible Pimp, there'll be at least something that makes you giggle whenever you think of it.

All that said, BBC America can look forward to a few letters of mixed reactions, and Comedy Central can start kicking themselves for not being the first to snatch it up."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Brilliant,"I got the first two seasons on DVD as a gift just recently...I had sadly never heard of the show before that. That being said, I sat down and started watching and I ended up watching the first two seasons right in a row practically without stopping....that's how good it is. A lot of the comedy is subtle, background stuff that continues to surface even after multiple viewings. This show is definitely geared towards people with a slightly twisted sense of humor that don't require a laugh track or a punch line to clue them into the humor. All hilarity aside, this crew does a good job in getting you to believe in the characters and to generally want to know what happens with them -- even when you know most of what they WILL do will make you cringe one way or another. Now I have to see about getting other seasons on DVD..."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,A comedy groundbreaker,Comentario no disponible
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,One of the funniest,"Watched the first episode and wasn't really impressed. My son-in-law talked me into giving the show another try. Some of the best comedy, EVER, from any country. Went to see the stage show with Tremblay,Wells and Smith in Dearborn in 2012. True to form these guys were just hilarious. Smith is also a good singer and accomplished guitarist.

Many ""back"" stories about these characters, ""Bubbles"" actually showed up on the set to apply for a sound mixing job and someone asked him to try on the goofy glasses........a star was born, so to speak.""Ricky's"" dad ""Ray"" is actually one of the executive producers and Sarah in real life is Jim Lahey's daughter."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Trailer PARK BOYS!!,"The definition of Canadian comedy with a strong sense of a reality mockumentary. At first you may laugh at the show's odd characters, semi skilled acting, and the amount of swearing and outrages endings. The main group is Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, all putting their own twist on the trio. Set in a trailer park the group simply solves their financial problems through robberies, cultivation, guns and scams everyone more extreme then the next. The group has there highs and their very lows, living in the shitmobile and constantly fighting the trailer park supervisor. I love this show and cant get enough of it, everyone should give it a try and watch the emotional roller-coaster of The Trailer Park BOys."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,One of the best shows I've seen,"And I watch WAYYY TOO MUCH TV AND MOVIES. This show is one of the funniest shows I've seen so far. The characters are great, I especially love Ricky-obviously. The fact that there is a character who refuses to wear shirts should make you want to watch this on it's own.

I read a comment that said it's isn't like real trailer park life in Nova Scotia, and maybe not. But it's a pretty damn accurate portrayal of life in a U.S. trailer park in the south. I mean, I've seen these people at Wal-Mart...all of them. There's a Jim Lehey everywhere, you just have to look hard enough.

Don't forget to watch The Mighty Boosh!"
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Thumbs WAY up down south,"Now, for a comment from a yank. This is THE funniest, THE biggest-hearted show I've ever had the good fortune to stumble across! On behalf of all of us poor, misbegotten souls that live due south of you Canadian's lower border (a.k.a the tree line) (sorry, I just couldn't resist), thank you, thank you, thank you! TPB isn't distributed in the U.S. as far as I can tell, so if you're a yank and unless you happen to live near the border and can watch CBC you won't know about this show other than by freak accident (it was a Netflix experiment for me). I see from the last couple of pages that there really are a few trifling slobs (on both sides of the Canadian/U.S. DMZ) that just don't get it. Well , I'm truly sorry for those poor miserable souls, probably something to do with the amount of fiber in their diet, but down here in Alabama WE sure get it! I've made it a (minor) mission to spread TPB around to everyone I can find with a pulse and I have yet to find anyone who (after a few episodes) hasn't been won over heart and soul (I make my friends send off for the DVD's after the first I give them, kind of like the neighborhood pusher). I won't say they don't exist in 'Bama (a land that may not have invented trailer parks, but has certainly perfected them) just that they're rare. Maybe that's why I like this part of the planet so much. I'm sorry for those who just don't get it, but I'm hard pressed to understand them either. After all, anyone who has ever had a family should recognize Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, et. al., with all their schemes, their plots, all their massively dysfunctional and f***ed up ways (to quote Ricky), and all their grace and generosity (where it REALLY matters) immediately. I know I certainly do, those guys are everyone I'm related to and everyone I ever grew up with boiled down and condensed. Apparently a lot of others do as well, which says many good things about the human race (even that part of it living in the desert south of you Canadian's border). This is a magnificent show, it makes me laugh so hard I have to pace myself so I won't end up at the doctor's office. I'm waiting on pins and needles for the movie (which should be out this month according to the net) and for the next season, and I really do mean pins and needles, what in the world will Ricky do next?! If you've somehow managed to read this far along in the comments and haven't seen TPB, do yourself a favor and get it! If you still don't like it eat a bran muffin or something, you're obviously in need it."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Great Show... Just Gets Better.,"When I first discovered TPB, I really felt I discovered a new type of cult following. You know that moment when you saw Peep Show or The Thick of It for the first time? It felt like that. Fresh, laugh out loud comedy.

It's also great how the boys manage to get you on their side even though you know most of what they're doing is downright criminal. The sociology of this program is great as it paints a picture of very petty Trailor Park criminals who are also just people trying find their way in the world and establish peace in the park - despite some crazy antics, they really are good people who you root for.

I found it got progressively funny throughout seasons. At first, I turned off S8/E1 because it seemed a little polished and scripted but I went back to it after years and found it really did grip me much more than the previous series - the polishing was absolutely spot on. The stories got deeper and the new characters actually grew on me. What a great show."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Great mockumentary,"Wow. The great thing about this show, is that if someone didn't tell you it was not an actual documentary, you would not know any difference. These guys are unbelievable actors, I cannot picture them in their normal lives. They are Julian, Ricky, Bubbles, Mr. Lahey, etc. Think of less pathetic and sad, but funnier versions of the hosers in FUBAR.

I saw them at an HMV signing, and just could not get used to mike smith (Bubbles) without the glasses, serious under-bite and voice. It may be a little tough to get used to but if you give this show a chance, get to know the characters, you will not regret it. If you live in the States, and have never seen it, and got a little money to blow on a great series, head over to your favourite place to order movies online and order it right away.

Although Seinfeld will always be my favourite comedy series of all time, TPB comes in at a close second. Easily the best movie/show to come out of Canada.

Thank God I live in Canada, and gave this show a chance one night, I now cannot wait for Sunday night to roll along with a new episode.

Also cant wait for the TPB movie!"
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Cult favorite,"This show will be a cult favorite, like another Canadian classic SCTV. One day it will be showing on US cable and watch out this show will explode. Like the hosers on SCTV, this show pokes fun at Canadians in a backwards way. Nice to see people laugh at themselves. What makes this show funny, is some of these characters must result from real life experiences. Everyone either has a relative, friend, co-worker, like Ricky, Bubbles, Corry, Trevor, and J Rock. J Rock the 29 year old, ridiculous looking White rapper wannabe, who lives with his mom. Ricky, the trailer park idiot,(Will Farrel of the show) who provides 90% of the material, while living in a car missing a right door; and Corry with his pal Trevor the 2 slow witted wannnabes who end up holding the bag. Living in East Kildonan this reminds me of my youth and shows how believable casting, and writing overcomes a lower budget. What's next a show about Postal Workers."
Trailer Park Boys: Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys,Why do so many Canadians think this is funny?,"I just don't understand why so many people in Canada actually believe this is so hilarious. I grant you, some times there is a line or two that hit the funny bone and the premise is decent (though much of it is recycled episode after episode), but the vast vast majority of bit intended to be funny just are not. I mean, one time with the ""shit__"" (shitthis, shitthat, shitstorm, shittornado, shitwhatever) is funny because it shows something about the Leahy character, but every frikking episode?! And after the first season or two, everybody seems to concatenate ""shit"" to everything, not just Leahy. It's like they got a laugh out of it once so they repeat it ad nauseum. And the drink constantly in hand, OK, that works for a while and would work better if there were periods where there is no drink, but it is no longer funny and is entirely forced after a few seasons of it. And the Bubbles character...I'm sorry, I love laughing at the disabled as much as any red-blooded able-bodied person, but come on. There is not a line out of his mouth that is funny on its own, everything is un-funny/dumb and is forced through his dull imitation of an idiot savant voice. It's about like watching the character that Jerry Lewis played with Dean Martin updated with ""sh*t"" and ""f*ck"". And they devote whole shows to the one unfunny bit that they seem to think is hilarious. Case in point, ""Conky"".

I believe they conceived the whole program based entirely around the guy who plays Ricky being very adept at malapropisms and having the eastern Canadian redneck schtick down very well. The other characters, every one of them, were afterthoughts, straight men/women for him to play off. In fact, much of the dialogue comes off as ad lib by people who are nervous doing it and are not very clever or quick, as though they were told a situation and had to wing it from there, playing a sort of mad-lib with the other actors. Like the director said, ""Ok, everyone, Conky is a ventriloquists doll that Bubbles really likes. Play with that. And....action!"" Besides the occasional Ricky-based funny bits, I think the best part of the show is the entry and exit music; it is somehow to me soothing, lightly happy and nostalgic, like it deserves to have a bubble machine in the background. I honestly think that is why I have watched so many of the episodes because, honestly, if you've seen one you have seen them all, or at least seen all the jokes."

True: Magical Friends,Its pretty bad..,"Overall I tried watching it twice and its easy to say It's very vague and it exagerates the humor which honestly comes out as just bland and unfunny and it tries to be random just for the sake of random. This show tries to make these characters be ""spontaneous"" but honestly it comes out more of just irritating. Another issue im having is the fact on how they portrait the younger characters and the older characters making them look below them which makes it seem more like a social criticism. There's nothing to look forward to in this series other than more vague humor."
True: Magical Friends,"Please, no more magical girl ""deconstructions""","Seriously, by this point, the attempt of making another ""deconstruction"" (Curse you, Derrida. And curse you, Gen Urobuchi. And also curse all the people who keeps misusing this term) of magical girl cartoons is just as dull, unoriginal, lazy and stale as making ""gritty"" superhero deconstructions or ""subversive"" fairy tales where the prince charming is a jerk and the princess is a badass action hero.

And is also as unoriginal as making stories where Superman (Or a character resembling Superman) is evil.

Seriously, by now ""subversive"" magical girl shows are the norm, not the exception. Try ""deconstructing"" something else. (I personally suggest deconstructing trite adult cartoons like this.)"
True: Magical Friends,Unbelievably bad,"After watching this show I'm not sure what confuses me more, the fact that someone thought that this story worked the way it is written, or the story having been written by anybody to begin with. Nothing flows into the next scene and the art style is incredibly lazy. If you're going to half such lazy designs for the characters at least push above 30 frames per second, this felt like the opening of mad max where there are frames missing or it's just really obvious this was not just made on a small budget, but made by cutting corners."
True: Magical Friends,Unmagical,"I really tried... but what... what are we doing here? Phoning in pop culture jokes that will age like 3 day old yak milk? Making characters that are supposed to appeal to a specific demographic while also making them as bland as possible? This is a shining example of 'edgy cartoon by boardroom'. There are better ways to waste your time, trust me."
True: Magical Friends,A Show That Remembers How To Have Fun!,"Perfect length and fun adult comedy that has a hype-train of undeserved hate behind it. It might not be Archer, but certainly an enjoyable watch for people not upset that women can be cartoon characters too. Fun send up of classic anime-tropes with likable modern characters.

Unreasonable backlash from guys who probably got turned down by girls like these. Some dated humor, but if you could go back and enjoy Home Movies or the Clerks animated series you can get some decent chuckles out of this."

True: Magical Friends,You cancelled good shows for this?,"SyFy must really hate being successful. Firstly this show is bad, it already been forgotten.

But remember when SyFy had The Expanse on their network? Remember when they cancelled The Magicians for funding for shows like this?"
True: Magical Friends,Proof that networks will greenlit ANYTHING as long as you know the right people...,"Badly written, terribly animated, unimaginative, and so irritatingly dull that despite its short length it feels like nearly a whole hour has gone by once its finished. The people behind this series clearly happened to know the right people to get this greenlit and hot in development, because I am sorry but I cannot imagine a reality where somebody worked that hard to create this kind of concept and spent weeks preparing to create an effective pitch to an executive.

How sad is it if you're an outsider who spends years studying animation, screenwriting, the art of the deal, and public speaking and finally makes it into Los Angeles, gets to know the entire landscape, spends months to years connecting with people, and when the opportunity presents itself and you pour your heart out...You get a near emotionless ""interesting, we'll get back to you on that"" (And they never do). Meanwhile, lazy people who just happen to be 'in the club' and party till dawn with producers and network executives don't have to say more than twenty words to get a show greenlit. I'll tell you how sad it is...It is very sad, but also very pathetic.

Please people, do not support this program. It promotes laziness and just illustrates how desperate the SyFy channel is at trying to be 'hip'."
True: Magical Friends,"Is this Tumblr's idea of an ""anime""?","This show seems like it was going for the same approach as Panty and Stocking a la Sailor Moon. We got one hero using birth control and another who happens to be a lesbian stoner. I mean, she has to be a stoner, look at her design. The main issue is that they tried too hard to pander to the progressives, precisely with the villains in some episodes. If you want to make your original works inspired by anime succeed, take my advice, and don't shoehorn your ideologies into your work, to where it feels like you're forcing us to adopt these same ideologies."
True: Magical Friends,painfully bad,"Painfully bad is a huge understatement, most likely (and dear lord hopefully) the worst cartoon of the decade"
True: Magical Friends,Watching leaves photosynthesize is more entertaining,"As someone who grew up in 2003, I was exposed to tons of good Western Animation and Anime, and it fueled my deep love for both the genres. That's why when I heard that a show that was combining both genres, I was excited.

And oh god I wish I wasn't.

This show is exactly what the problem of every modern genre of Western television is. I know that sounds absurd but you'll understand as I explain.

Let's start with the most important part of any story, the characters. The main characters are Alex and Daisy, two New Yorkers who are roommates. What are their traits? Well, Alex is lazy and a brat who doesn't like putting effort into anything with no redeeming qualities and Daisy is a hardworking pushover, and while she's miles better than Alex, she's not an interesting character in general and offers nothing unique or special to the story. You can swap her out with any of the background extras and it wouldn't make a difference, because everyone in the show has the personality of A) An ice lolly stick after it's melted or B) A complete rhymes-with-brass-pole. She's also a mouthpiece for the creator of the show's opinions and fires them off at random. Half her lines are unfunny jokes or references to other media. We learn nothing about the story and who she is from the dialogue, it's just John Wick reference after John Wick reference or something critiquing capitalism.

The characters give us no reason for us to root for them because apart from being jerks they're straight up idiotic. In the second episode, instead of using their powers to further the story and progress the plot, they waste it on fake celebrity paraphernalia. I should also mention if you are disgusted by bodily dysfunction jokes, then avoid this show, because this show mentions Daisy's gross habits a lot and Alex uses her period blood as a weapon in episode 3. It's ironic how this show criticizes geek fanboys (in one episode, there are three dudes with T shirts that have the words ""Pepe"" and ""Gamergate""...like dude, Gamergate was YEARS ago, not even the people in Gamergate talk about it anymore. And nobody wears shirts like that) but expects us to root for Daisy despite her degeneracy (she blows Alex's hard earned rent money on underwear and writes fanfiction of her dating Scully. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, we all use fanfiction as an outlet, but why is Daisy portrayed as in the right and the Gamergate fanboys are depicted as in the wrong?).

The show feels like a sitcom where they take all the magical girl tropes and do nothing new or unique with them, it has the sitcom humor, the characters going on long speeches about political opinions (like Brian from S8 Family Guy) and a boring plot. The villains looked more interesting, but they, like the heroes, were also later shown to be flat as cardboard and petty (Veerus and Nut are exes and Corvin changes sides on a whim because Veerus is too stupid to appreciate his work for her).

Also this show tries too hard to identify with the millennial/Gen Z demographic. It's not just the constant dropping of references, it's the fact that Daisy's entire schtick is that she's a stoner and smokes. And for a show that tries to highlight the difficulties of being a millenial in this day and age, it fails at that because Alex and Daisy literally can send a mushroom species to space and not face any consequences for it. That and Nut makes no effort to improve them or prepare them as warriors. Instead she joins in with their laziness .

The animation is horrible too, I hate the way they move. It seems like they took a page out of 2016 PPG. There's no flow or smoothness to follow up on. The story makes it obvious that there's no writing staff. I'm surprised how this even got to air on TV and I'm 100% sure it's because of connections and networking.

If you want to watch this genre done better in parody form, Panty and Stocking has got you covered."
True: Magical Friends,A Bit Rough around the edges.,"This definitely has the feel of a low budget independent pilot season in the early days. The animation is rougher then the poster would suggest here, with the smoothest animation being during the transformation sequences and at odd points here and there through out the season run.

While there is definite need for polish here and there, certain aspects are worth noting as positive.

First, the concept of jaded urban millennial tropes being given magical powers utilized by a creator of the universe who is akin to that albatross around your neck relative that wont leave and wont help with chores was highly amusing, though needed to maintain consistency to carry the joke through, or pushed a little more to give that comedic punch.

Another positive is how the powers are utilized, which is perhaps where the highest point of humor and creativity in the series, and what kept me invested in watching.

For the Creators to keep in mind...

The girls themselves have the potential to be better characters, either as parody figures or something else if pushed further.

The antagonists need more development though as they were the weakest, and need more work on developing individual characterizations, dialogue, and believable establishment of motivations.

Once you have established better characterization it will help your story solidify and develop into something a bit more then the bare-bones for-the-sake-of-the-joke that it is, particularly when paired with a thoroughly researched point that you are trying to skewer."
True: Magical Friends,Made for women who like stoner cartoons,"This show is funny!

Some men might be thrown from it because there's lots of jokes just for females and most men still get upset by this.

If you're a women who likes cartoons ~ This shows made for You!"
True: Magical Friends,Far from Magical,"This cartoon is an adult take on the ""Magical girl"" genre it is 100% satire filled with gross/immature adult humor. I personally love it! It is overly outrageous and pokes fun of modern day problems. i also love the extrema feminism. this show makes me think of Panty and stocking Or maybe an animated broad city! I don't understand the hate this cartoon gets, I want to see more seasons I feel this has the potential of becoming a cult classic in 10 years."
True: Magical Friends,Pretty fun!,"I have no clue what Syfy channel drama this show has behind it, but I watched it all without that context. Y'all really hated this?!

I am a long-time lover of the magical girl genre, and seeing a little satirical, millennial take sounded fun-- and it WAS fun! I enjoyed the writing, the jokes, and the animation... Maybe I have low standards, but I've seen much worse, and found the character designs cute, silly and entertaining. Not to mention, having your birth control as a weapon is pretty hilarious, especially with birth control-related attacks to match. I did also enjoy the bong weapon. :)

Overall, I think this series is a fun and quick watch that I'd recommend."
True: Magical Friends,Really great!,"This little show premiered last night on Syfy. I saw the first episode, it was an interesting start. The show is a huge parody of magical girl shows like Sailor Moon. The best way to describe the show is that it is Tuca and Bertie combined with Sailor Moon. The art style is adorable and reminds me of Craig of the Creek, and the writing is hilariously funny. Alex and Daisy have a great dynamic with each other, and the show is highly empowering and relatable to millennials. I hope to see more episodes soon since the lore seems interesting. This, Final Space, Tuca and Bertie, Primal, Bob's Burgers, Duncanville, Close Enough, and Central Park are my favorite modern adult cartoons."
True: Magical Friends,I'd watch forever,Comentario no disponible
True: Magical Friends,Watched two episodes,While the shows extremely humorous I'll give it that these 2 shows have lasted a total of 6 minutes all together it really doesn't give a good amount of time I wrote a review on this problem before on another account and I am not sure if I'll keep trying this though it's very very funny
True: Magical Friends,"Quirky, fun and easy to watch",An enjoyable watch with relatable characters in wonderfully absurd scenarios.
True: Magical Friends,"Sailor Moon and Steven Universe, but for Adults.","I got interested on watching Syfy when I see some shows. Shows like Happy!, that show was promising and funny to watch. And then, Syfy got a lot better with their animation programming block, TZGZ which reveals a plenty of adult animated shows, especially some from the internet. Adult animated web shows like Hell Den, Gary and His Demons, Purgatony, Science, Wild Life, Cyanide & Happiness, Don't Feed The Humans, and Dallas & Robo. TZGZ also airs one of my favorite adults cartoons, Futurama, Not only does Futurama used to air on Fox and then to Adult Swim and then straight to Comedy Central and only on Comedy Central, but Futurama airs on Syfy too. Syfy has some original adult cartoons such as Alien News Desk and my personal favorite, ""Magical Girl Friendship Squad"". The show features two young women, named Alex and Daisy who are very directionless must save the Universe from dark evil forces with the help of magical girl power and their little red panda friend named ""Nut"". I really like the style of the show, it resembles the style of Steven Universe (which Steven Universe is one of the cartoons that changes cartoon history) and both the writing ans comedy are pretty good and the action scenes were decent. The animation is also decent by the way. This is by far one of my favorite adult cartoons alongside with The Midnight Gospel, Close Enough, Rick and Morty, Final Space, Tuca & Bertie, Solar Opposites, Primal, Lazor Wulf and Hoops. I can't for more of this show and I recommend anyone to watch this show. I give it a 9.5/10"
True: Magical Friends,"It's just catered to people like me, if you're like me, you'd love it.","I mean this show was specifically catered to me and I lived every second of that. The kind of millenial cringe jokes, anime and fandom references, gay vibes is exactly what I didn't know I wanted, but felt seen when given. Super happy it exists."
True: Magical Friends,Hilarious,"Anyone who gives this one star are the exact people this show is mocking. Super funny, fresh, and made me laugh out loud. If you grew up on Sailor moon or any other magical girl trope this will have you belly laughing every episode! If you can't enjoy or see the humor of this show you probably are miserable to be around and I feel sorry for you. The previous one star reviews are an absolute riot and are almost as funny as the show! Also love that Matteo Lane is one of the voice actors, he's one of my favorite comedians! Disregard all the incels leaving one star reviews and give this show a chance, you won't regret it!"

The antagonists need more development though as they were the weakest, and need more work on developing individual characterizations, dialogue, and believable establishment of motivations.

Once you have established better characterization it will help your story solidify and develop into something a bit more then the bare-bones for-the-sake-of-the-joke that it is, particularly when paired with a thoroughly researched point that you are trying to skewer."
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Made for women who like stoner cartoons,"This show is funny!

Some men might be thrown from it because there's lots of jokes just for females and most men still get upset by this.

If you're a women who likes cartoons ~ This shows made for You!"
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Far from Magical,"This cartoon is an adult take on the ""Magical girl"" genre it is 100% satire filled with gross/immature adult humor. I personally love it! It is overly outrageous and pokes fun of modern day problems. i also love the extrema feminism. this show makes me think of Panty and stocking Or maybe an animated broad city! I don't understand the hate this cartoon gets, I want to see more seasons I feel this has the potential of becoming a cult classic in 10 years."
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Pretty fun!,"I have no clue what Syfy channel drama this show has behind it, but I watched it all without that context. Y'all really hated this?!

I am a long-time lover of the magical girl genre, and seeing a little satirical, millennial take sounded fun-- and it WAS fun! I enjoyed the writing, the jokes, and the animation... Maybe I have low standards, but I've seen much worse, and found the character designs cute, silly and entertaining. Not to mention, having your birth control as a weapon is pretty hilarious, especially with birth control-related attacks to match. I did also enjoy the bong weapon. :)

Overall, I think this series is a fun and quick watch that I'd recommend."
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Really great!,"This little show premiered last night on Syfy. I saw the first episode, it was an interesting start. The show is a huge parody of magical girl shows like Sailor Moon. The best way to describe the show is that it is Tuca and Bertie combined with Sailor Moon. The art style is adorable and reminds me of Craig of the Creek, and the writing is hilariously funny. Alex and Daisy have a great dynamic with each other, and the show is highly empowering and relatable to millennials. I hope to see more episodes soon since the lore seems interesting. This, Final Space, Tuca and Bertie, Primal, Bob's Burgers, Duncanville, Close Enough, and Central Park are my favorite modern adult cartoons."
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,I'd watch forever,Comentario no disponible
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Watched two episodes,While the shows extremely humorous I'll give it that these 2 shows have lasted a total of 6 minutes all together it really doesn't give a good amount of time I wrote a review on this problem before on another account and I am not sure if I'll keep trying this though it's very very funny
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,"Quirky, fun and easy to watch",An enjoyable watch with relatable characters in wonderfully absurd scenarios.
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,"Sailor Moon and Steven Universe, but for Adults.","I got interested on watching Syfy when I see some shows. Shows like Happy!, that show was promising and funny to watch. And then, Syfy got a lot better with their animation programming block, TZGZ which reveals a plenty of adult animated shows, especially some from the internet. Adult animated web shows like Hell Den, Gary and His Demons, Purgatony, Science, Wild Life, Cyanide & Happiness, Don't Feed The Humans, and Dallas & Robo. TZGZ also airs one of my favorite adults cartoons, Futurama, Not only does Futurama used to air on Fox and then to Adult Swim and then straight to Comedy Central and only on Comedy Central, but Futurama airs on Syfy too. Syfy has some original adult cartoons such as Alien News Desk and my personal favorite, ""Magical Girl Friendship Squad"". The show features two young women, named Alex and Daisy who are very directionless must save the Universe from dark evil forces with the help of magical girl power and their little red panda friend named ""Nut"". I really like the style of the show, it resembles the style of Steven Universe (which Steven Universe is one of the cartoons that changes cartoon history) and both the writing ans comedy are pretty good and the action scenes were decent. The animation is also decent by the way. This is by far one of my favorite adult cartoons alongside with The Midnight Gospel, Close Enough, Rick and Morty, Final Space, Tuca & Bertie, Solar Opposites, Primal, Lazor Wulf and Hoops. I can't for more of this show and I recommend anyone to watch this show. I give it a 9.5/10"
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,"It's just catered to people like me, if you're like me, you'd love it.","I mean this show was specifically catered to me and I lived every second of that. The kind of millenial cringe jokes, anime and fandom references, gay vibes is exactly what I didn't know I wanted, but felt seen when given. Super happy it exists."
Deon Cole: Cole Hearted,Hilarious,"Anyone who gives this one star are the exact people this show is mocking. Super funny, fresh, and made me laugh out loud. If you grew up on Sailor moon or any other magical girl trope this will have you belly laughing every episode! If you can't enjoy or see the humor of this show you probably are miserable to be around and I feel sorry for you. The previous one star reviews are an absolute riot and are almost as funny as the show! Also love that Matteo Lane is one of the voice actors, he's one of my favorite comedians! Disregard all the incels leaving one star reviews and give this show a chance, you won't regret it!"
The Interview,Good,"It is quite good. I have not read the original book, and I barely remember the movie (not even sure I watched it fully even), but I definitely enjoyed the show. The characters were complex enough, and they were being properly developed and expanded upon through-out the show. The story was intriguing overall, too.

In fact, I think the story is the main dish here, and it makes sense, why the original book became so important. I mean, it's not so much about vampires, as about emotions in general, and vampirism is more like a tool here to peek into (sometimes darker) depths of relationships.

The aesthetics are also quite good, and they mix with the story nicely. I like that there are quite a few ""dirty frames"" in the show, too, since they make the scene more believable, if not necessarily relatable. Certain theme may be a turn off for some, so I may not be able to recommend it everyone, but if you are ok with that theme (we all know what I mean, right?) - this show is definitely worth a try."
The Interview,Anne Rice wrote three of the episodes,"I've been surprised by the number of reviewers have lamented that this is not Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, even crying out ""Not one word written by Anne Rice!""

Actually, she and her son Christopher were heavily involved and were executive producers. And Anne herself wrote three of the episodes. She was proud of this work and happy for the reinvention of it.

It is possible to enjoy this even if you, as I did, read every book as they were written, awaiting each new volume and running to the bookstore as soon as they were released.

Is this different? Yes. And I'm glad for it. It's a way to enjoy the universe she created all over again without having to worry about some pristine, exact re-enactment. I can relax into it, seeing where it goes without expectation.

And it's a far cry better than the Brad Pitt/Tom Cruise debacle. I still shudder over that abomination.

It's excellently acted, the sets are magical, and the whole thing is quite enjoyable."
The Interview,Brilliantly executed!,"I would like to believe that if Anne Rice lived to see this recreation of her novel that she would be ecstatic. The acting is outstanding and execution of the written text into storytelling was flawless.

I've never been satisfied with the original movie and I hated Tom Cruise as Lestat. I'm aware that Ms. Rice was pleased with his performance, but I believe she would adore this depiction of Lestat. The series shows his multidimensional personality as well as showing Louis as more than the brooding bore he was depicted in the original movie. I can understand that the time constraints of a movie cannot truly show the depths of character that a miniseries can.

This miniseries is brilliantly done and does the book and its author proud."
The Interview,Fabulous,"I'm a big fan of Anne Rice. I have read her books and seen the film of Interview with the Vampire which I loved. I hoped this would be good and it went far beyond that. It's exceptional. It's the expensive vintage wine amongst all the lesser ones. The acting is superb from all of the cast. It's a tragic love story amongst all the blood. It's about pain, love, loss and mistakes. The three leads are just outstanding. Jacob Anderson, Sam Reid and Assad Zaman. Such emotionally packed scenes. They all deserve Oscar's. Eric Bogosion is great as Daniel. Also Ben Daniel is wonderful as Santiago. The sets and scenery are stunning. I haven't watched anything with such love and passion in a long time. I'm really looking forward to a season 3."
The Interview,Better Than Expected,"Interview with the Vampire was actually even better than I was expecting. It's based on Anne Rice's popular novel about a family of vampires through the years. This is made with mostly unknown actors who all do a great job in their roles. There was also a popular movie about this made in 1994 with Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst. Obviously most people will compare the two and even though I liked the movie a little more this more than holds up and stands in its own. I never read the books but I've read that this show is a lot closer to it than the movie was. You can tell they try to respect the source material as much as possible and even had Anne Rice help create the show and have her on as an executive producer before her death last year. After reading through the reviews I'm glad that most people seem to agree with me that this is a good show."
The Interview,Exceptional,"Exceptional on all categories; casting, mua, cinematography, lighting design, set design, costuming, and holy god the adaptation and acting are a home run. It's truly gorgeous, deeply loving, and genuinely horrifying. Phenomenal. It's a star-making series that I genuinely hope sweeps awards ceremonies once it reaches submission. Well done all involved. Thank you for creating and supporting the production of this awesome series - that somehow is even more profound in series 2...it's amazing and I'm going to be running my mouth off for years to anyone who hasn't seen it. Exquisite re-telling. Perfection!"
The Interview,Exceptionally written,"I was skeptical at first. I had been a fan of the original movie. The cast in the movie was nearly perfect at the time. But the books were always disturbing to me. They had pedophilia and incest, which was such a typical thing in Anne Rice's books. That always bothered me. This series has taken the essentials of the book and made it better. Sorry Rice's fans, but I prefer a story where two grown men are fully aware of their relationship, over all the love and sexual feelings between a grown man and a woman in a 5 year old girl's body. At least the 90's movie had Claudia as an older girl, still too young, but they skipped the romantic and sexual relationship she had with Louis in the book. I much prefer this series' story, and I fully appreciate the way they adapted it to our present, Covid and all. I deeply appreciate that they made Claudia a teenager. And her love interests are usually age appropriate.

The writing is beautiful. I actually do not like gore nor stressful sexual scenarios. But the relationships in this show have been very well written and better yet, believable. The dialogue is very elegant even when they speak of horrible things like violent death and describe the terrible things that happen in the scenes. Every line has an intent and it's neither long and boring nor too short.

I loved Lestat. Sam Reid is exquisite as Lestat. OMG. His French accent is such a beautiful and important piece we missed in the movie. I always heard him with a French accent when I read the books and I appreciate the effort they put on making him more genuine. His acting is flawless. You really fall in love with his character. Bravo.

The rest of the cast is amazing. Even though they switch Claudia's actress in the second season, both Bailey and Delainey are brilliant at their work. Jacob as Louis was very good. His acting was superb. Eric as Daniel was pretty genuine. Assad was good but I always pictured Armand more like Antonio Bandera's version in my head. But the books do say he was pretty ""boyish"" so Assad actually fits the role very well. Ben as Santiago was perfect.

I think the only mistake has been naming it ""Anne Rice's"" IWTV. It's definitely not really the original Anne Rice's work. It's better. Her work, as beloved as it was, if you read it, it's sick and disgusting. I'll never be on board with her sadistic women sexual humiliation and pedophilia. But I get why they did it. It might've not grabbed our attention otherwise after so many vampire stories. The subject had become a bit exhausted and naming it IWTV grabbed our attention. Well played. I'm impressed."
The Interview,Worth the watch,"The show is brilliant and a lot better than I expected. I have not read the books but the movie is one of my favorite films. One thing i must say is the first season is by far superior vs the 2nd. Claudia (Bailey Bass) is a lot more sophisticated, charismatic and has stronger acting during the first season compared to (Delainey Hayles). The relationship between the 3 (Claudia, Lestat and Louis) carried a big part of the first season to make it what it is. The connection between Lestat and Louis is deep and you can feel that unbreakable bond within their strong acting meanwhile Armand is plain and boring.

Overall, if you like that sort of theme, I think you'll enjoy the show. I am not sure why the book fans give it a bad rating and can't take it for what it is. The homosexuality is quite bold if you're comparing it to the movie so take that as you wish. My average rating is due to the let down of season 2 which i have yet to finish so I may edit it later."
The Interview,The acting is sublime!,Comentario no disponible
The Interview,Research I BEG of you.,"First of all, reviews going ""Anne was a producer so she must have been okay with it"" no she wasn't. As soon as she passed they shoved Christopher out of the producing and rewrote what Anne had given them of her first three episodes she had written. Stop living in that fantasy of her approval I beg of you, use you're context clues of Chris not talking about this train wreck. Malloy is irritating, Louis has been stripped of all of his depth and reason, and Claudia is even more insufferable. Sam Reid is the only thing keeping me going and that the second season isn't like this offal set in political agendas."

The Interview,Insanely Good,"There are things I wanted to say but cannot. This show is everything! The acting is superb, all the story lines are amazing. Every time I rewatch I see it from a different perspective. It's also seemingly such a mirror of life and how sometimes we do not see what those we love are actually doing to us. The games they play, and the way we ignore the obvious in order to keep living the delusional life. Lestat, Lestat, Lestat! Such incredible acting one min. I hate him, then I feel sorry for him then I'm just literally falling for this flirty vampire. Louie! Oh man I have felt like Louie totally blinded by love or the idea of love yet lonely. I can go on and on but all the characters brought something to this series. Phenomenal cast and directing.

This story lives in my head rent free! Can't wait for next season!"
The Interview,Thorn Between the Novel and the Series,"What can I say?

This is my second review of this series, now that I finished watching season 2, and I'm gonna admit that the production, acting and re-telling is very engaging. I mean, this cast is great.

Jacob's Louis is far removed from both the literarily and film versions, but by the end of season 2 there's no doubt that he becomes the Louis version for modern audiences.

The same with Sam's Lestat. Those who ""know"" Lestat via his novels know that he shouldn't look a day older than 20 years. So, when seen Sam's Lestat for the first time, I immediately felt there was something odd; too old, to manly, too tall. Again, by the end of season 2 Sam was Lestat in my mind.

However, the highlight, just like with the novels, is Claudia. I mean, a 5 years old child vampire? Who could play that? Whose child could be put through the range of emotions Claudia requires? The answer, just like the film version, is nobody. This time around Rolin Jones said to himself ""screw this"", and cast Bailey Bass for season 1, and Delainey Hayles for season 2 as a ""teen"" Claudia. Let me tell you, both ladies shine in this role.

Also, Assad Zaman,Ben Daniels and Eric Bogosian are superb in their interpretations of Armand, Santiago and Danny.

Now that I'm done watching I'll say that I like how the producers choose to re-tell it. The approach, style and flow justify a re-telling without ignoring the source.

The main conflict, at least for me, comes from knowing the source material too well. Interview with the vampire, the novel, is 48 years old, (as of 2024). It means that an entire generation grew up with the version Anne created.

Rolin Jones's Interview with the vampire claims that everything we learned from Anne was partially wrong. The passing of time and different emotional states clouded the minds and memories of Anne's characters, and are Anne's characters who contradict her over and over again.

To me, this is the main reason this series doesn't score higher. Because now I doubt Anne's and Jone's versions in equal measure. Who's not to say that in 10-20 years, another producer will -retell Jone's version diluting even further Anne's work?

This series is brilliantly acted, beautifully written, and superbly produced.

My only advice is for the new audience to stay away from the books."
The Interview,I don't like it..,"This is not Anne Rices Interview with the vampire.

This is a complete different story.

I really do not understand why they had to change so much it's frustrating.

I watched the movie a couple of times and it is one of my favorite movies and I read the book.

Louis wasn't a Pimp in the book or the movie. His family died. He was married and his wife was pregnant (wife and child died during labor)..

Well..iam disappointed.

The only thing in this show that is correct are the names of the characters everything else has nothing to do with the original story! This show should have a different name."
The Interview,Awesome,"I actually enjoyed Interview with the Vampire even more than I thought I would. I liked the movie so I thought this would be a little bit of a disappointment but it wasn't. Far from it. This one actually takes place in our current year. Vampire Louie de Pointe du Lac is currently living in Dubai and is telling his life story to a journalist. The story starts in New Orleans in the 20th century and shows how he met the vampire Lestat du Lioncourt and how they started their family with the two of them and teen vampire Claudia. It's much like the movie where the story follows Louie telling his side of the story to the journalist. It's also different in many ways to the movie, not bad just different. I've actually come to like it even more than the movie."
The Interview,Lestat Lestat Lestat Lestat Lestat,"Lestat is everything! His actor is superb, his Lestat carries such an allure and he's magnetic when he's on screen, just like a real vampire. He said it's always been his dream role and you can tell with how much effort he puts into the character. The entire cast is noteworthy but the standout for me is Lestat.

I had somehow never heard of Anne Rice or Interview with the Vampire (wish I did because I would've loved the books as a kid) but this was such a fantastic introduction. I will definitely be reading The Vampire Lestat while I giddily wait for season 3.

You can tell everyone involved is so passionate about this show and the show-runner has a strong vision and knows exactly what he wants. I hope they continue making fantastic TV!"
The Interview,Unbelievably superb!,"Interview with a Vampire film was a fantastic adaptation of the Anne Rice books, this series is absolutely next level!

The acting, the story telling, the writing all add up to give you a phenomenal series! Sam Reid, Jacob Anderson, Bailey Bass, Assad Zaman and Eric Bogosian could not have been cast better!

The soundtrack that accompanies this, does so delicately peeking at the right moment.

The way the 'Interview' is done, the back drop, the old world set against the new world of Dubai - the juxtaposition of Dubai itself!! How the story interweaves between the detail, new and old vampires, and the modern day!

A very worthy accompaniment to Anne Rice's books!"

The Interview,Misleading but...,"I wanted to watch Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire hoping to enjoy, (finally), an adaptation that does justice to Anne's great novel. Instead I got a vampire show that borrows from her novel.

First, the positive, Sam Reid, Bailey Bass, and Jacob Anderson are good, the show has good production values, and direction is solid from episodes 4 trough episode 7.

However, all the main characters are miscast as Lestat, Claudia and Louis; in this aspect the TV show mirrors the 1994, and 2002 films. Both projects failed with the age of the characters, but the TV show unnecessarily also changes race, (Louis, Claudia), for the sake of inclusion.

Also, a complete change of time-period, events, characters, sexuality elements, and dialogue that never occurred in the original source. Which, to be fair, is not new in these kind of vehicles - see, CW's The Vampire Diaries.

To make it very clear, this TV show uses Anne Rice's brand as a hook not as an homage. This product is a different creature made by different creators who didn't bother to try to faithfully adapt the main story. They didn't set themselves to honor Anne's tale, instead they went and built on top of her best work, and the result is a lesser product.

No doubt, Anne and her son Christopher probably got paid handsomely.

Is it a bad show? No, it's not. In fact it is a good vampire show.

However, that's the real shame - why would anyone just want to make a good show? Why don't just be faithful to the source and aim for greatness instead?

I guess is a good thing Anne didn't got to watch it.

With another title and different character names this show; in my book, is an easy 8 - however, the mislead brings a bitter taste, and for that I can't force myself to give more than a 6.

Just a missed opportunity."
The Interview,Even better than the movie,"I was a little hesitant going into this because I was a big fan of the movie, Interview with the Vampire. I thought there's no way anyone's going to be able to do it better than Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, two of the best actors there are. Well, somehow this show was able to be almost as good, maybe even better than the movie. I've never seen Jacob Anderson or Sam Reid in anything before besides Anderson as Brey Worm in Game of Thrones so I wasn't familiar with their work. They both played the part of Louis and Lestat perfectly. I blew through the both the first and second seasons in less than three days. Anne Rice, who wrote the book and created these characters, was very hands on for this show and you can tell. I know they just recast the Claudia character but from what I can tell the new actress is even better. Some people (we all know who) don't like the fact that they cast a black actor as Louis which is just ridiculous. These people never fail in bombarding any show that has anyone who's not a straight white man as the lead with negative reviews."
The Interview,Never read the books - still not very good,"I've never read the books, so I didn't watch this expecting something. Just that I kind of like vampire stories.

I was encouraged after the first 2 episodes, but I've been watching the same episode ever since. There is no sense of fear, there is no ambiance. The creepeness of the scenes with the writer is just cringe. Its too frontal, and they keep having the same argument. It became boring, fast.

The writers don't know how to write development. The introduction was OK, but the rest is so conventionnal. The more it goes on, the more the acting seems bad, they have nothing to latch on except the big shouting matches. Everything Louis is had to be said by Lestat. The substance of their caracters is very thin, I don't believe them.

Claudia is bad. Two episodes to for her to yell her predicament... I haven't watched the movie in a long time, but it seems to me it was way better.

This show is the perfect example of what goes wrong when you make the characters say everything instead of showing it and letting the viewers intelligence do the rest."

The Interview,How is this stuck on AMC?,"I have lost count how many times I've read (and listened to) the 13 book series and have dug deeper in the ""Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles: An Alphabettery"". I believe that I know this material.

Of course I'm a fan of Anne Rice's work. This TV series is NOT that; but it IS highly referential to her books. Fan fiction? It is more than that. Maybe a better descriptor it's that it is a marriage of fan fiction and the original work.

This series is a most masterful blend of top notch everything -except marketing. (I found out about it in 2023 by accident.). Instead of trying to list the various fields involved and then talk about how each field is represented at the height of its own artistry yet they work seamlessly together with the other fields, it is more honest to say that I cannot find an area that is lacking. Again, except marketing.

This is a banner series that would make any network or streaming service a must have...assuming people knew about it. Congratulations to everyone involved with it!!"
The Interview,Homosexual Twilight,"It's not a bad show but it focuses too much on the soap opera part. It's almost a sin to be straight in this show, which I find funny since everyone pretends to be so open minded about sexuality. Even the journalist (Daniel Molloy) points out that the retelling of the story is embellished to sound more like a fantasy than the actual facts.

All-in-all I still think that this is a much better love story than Twilight :D There are some interesting characters and stories that trace back to the original Book and Movie, but there are some flaws as well that make the show feel like a drag to push through to get to a conclusion. It's also kind of weird that they made the vampire eyes look almost anime.

In terms of acting, the main characters are decent but a lot of the second leads fall off the ladder rather fast.

It's a rather forgettable show but it's ok if you just want to burn some time and have nothing better to do."

Sailor Moon Crystal,,
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Daniel Natu ( Vlad Dracula),"Yes historically not accurate, lots of BS etc.. But it was entertaining. I actually watched the whole series in a day. Mehmed vs Vlad is better than the previous one. I like the actor who played Mehmed ( Cem Yigit Uzumoglu) I think he was great. Story telling was also great ( I think he is the guy who played the lanister in GOT) . But what people should notice is the actor who played Vlad Dracula. He wasn't acting, it looked real. We don't see this level of acting very often. Absolutelly amazing. I think he is World Class and he should be in Hollywood. What a great actor. Well Done Daniel. I wish you all the best. And would like to see more from you. 10/10."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Very entertaining and educational,"I found this mix of drama and documentary highly entertaining, visually impressive, and educational. I've read a few books about the siege of Constantinople, and always thought ""what a great story, why doesn't anyone make a movie out of it?"". When I found out that this was a Turkish production, I was afraid it'd be based as they are too close to the subject to be objective, but the basics of the story are accurately displayed. Yes, they puffed up Giustiniani and added a couple of female characters while other protagonists are missing. They simplified a lot of stuff and didn't go in depth into what preceded the siege and the motivations of the characters. But most of what made the cut is historically accurate, always allowing for the conflicting accounts and various viewpoints. Choices were obviously made on basis of which made better dramaturgical sense and which were more realistic, not in order to glorify this or that side. Some Turkish reviewers insist that ""this isn't how it happened"" (meaning ""not what was I taught at school"") and even believe that sultan Mehmet actually designed his cannons himself. Now maybe that's reported by one of his biographers but how possible is it that a 20-year old prince with no knowledge of metallurgy designed the most advanced weapons of his time? Anyway, I found that the producers used the source material well and come out with a gripping docu-drama that generally respected historical truth. If you want more nuances, read some books! I'm already looking forward to the next series."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Historically accurate with an Italian fetish,"As a a Greek, I could have been pre-emptively negative about this series. However, I cannot ignore the fact that the producers did some serious research and consultation before they put pen to paper. From the small conversations to the serious arguments, it appears that they have checked first with the historians.

There is good acting, good atmosphere, good costumes, decent battle scenes and loved the fact that the producers were careful with not allowing the documentary bit to take over.

The only three things that stopped me from giving it a 10/10 are that -) The utter obsession with Justinian to the point the whole series is about him and how heroic the Italians were. -) The obsession with portraying all Greeks as treacherous cowards (you couldn't help yourselves there :) -) Portraying the Turks as inferior and Mehmed a hotheaded and reckless

I strongly recommend and can't wait for the sequel (probably about Vienna)"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,This has no business being this good,"I was pleasantly surprised that a second season came out, and about Mehmed II and the notorious Vlad no less. I really liked the first season because it's like a storytelling by historians with the flare of well done reenactment. Obviously, there are liberties taken for the drama, but it's cool to have a mix of history with what could be another Vikings type show. Although some of the the acting isn't Oscar worthy, the actor playing Mehmed has a memorable face and owns the role.

I am hoping they do another one about the Romans or, better yet, the Egyptians. But I love this retelling because I'd take a guess that the average Westerner doesn't know a lot about the Ottoman Empire. I'd like another season, please!"
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,More Turkish and Ottoman History please,We practically are not aware of any of the Ottoman and Turkish history. To date there haven't been any American or European movies covering the conquest of Constantinople to my knowledge. I believe this indicates a bias.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Vlad was much more than shown in this,"All chronicals besides turkish ones say that Vlad scored a great victory at the Night Attack and Mehmed fled the camp. If this was not the case then i ask you Where would he gather so many ottomans to impale near Targoviste? How about time to impale?

Recommend HistoryMarche on youtube for a better view on Vlad the Impaler

The show has it.s ups and downs , depictes some aspects good and some rather miserable. Since it.s a documentary, historical facts should be represented as they were and not florished to make Mehmed more apealing to viewers. I still recommend the show and the actors playing Vlad and Mehmed did a great job. Still better than hollywood movies. At least Constantinopole had a ditch in front of the walls and this was the most esential defending construction during that time. Enjoyed the costumes as well. Anyway, keep this genre going as it.s way better than any movie."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Somewhat inaccurate but very well dramatized depication of the Siege of Constantinople,"I'm not sure what exactly the future of this series is - will the next seasons be about Ottomans, other empires, or will there not even be more seasons? Regardless, this first season could more aptly have been named the Siege of Constantinople, as it is almost all about that famed siege. Good thing too, because 6 episodes seems to be the perfect length for depicting the siege in full. And the series is very well paced, although some of the flashback scenes feel a bit too long.

The siege itself is exceptionally well depicted. The budget was either very high, or very well used, because the quality of the CGI, the sets, and the costumes is simply superb, and the actors too are brilliant. The show doesn't quite bias towards one side. If there is a bias, there is a bias against realism. Both sides are depicted in a more positive light than should be. The Genoans and Venetians were far less scheming than they were in real life, and the mercenaries defending the city more adept and brave than they truly were. Conversely, the show also glosses over the Ottoman plundering of the city. But apart from that criticism, I can't really find anything I disliked about the depiction of the siege itself. I also really appreciated that the show stressed the importance of it - the demise of the 1500 year old Empire, giving birth to one that would last nearly 500 years more.

I'm not sure I quite like the docudrama style of storytelling. I think it is a tad lazy compared to just telling a story through actors. But that is a minor issue I have with an otherwise excellent depiction of a legendary siege."

Rise of Empires: Ottoman,I like it but too much Giustiniani,It seems the war was between Giustiniani and Sultan Mehmet. Also some how all the elite Ottoman soldiers are not elite at all. They died very quickly. One more thing. About 4 ships against 100 doesn't make sense. How come ottoman didn't use cannons to destroy them.
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Good series but wrong title,Comentario no disponible
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Powerful and bingeworthy,"This is a historical fiction docuseries, showing the Fall of Constantinople from a Turkish perspective. Historical fiction is by definition not fully historically accurate, because past events are placed on a narrative arc and dramatized in order to build a strong story. Accept this and you'll be a happier viewer.

The iron-willed Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror is beautifully played by Cem Yigit Uzümoglu, who's destined to become a global star after this memorable performance. Because of Cem's passionate portrayal of the young Ottoman ruler Mehmed II, I found myself rooting for him despite of the tragic fates of many soldiers, mercenaries and innocent civilians.

This series was produced and directed by a Turkish film team, and most actors are also Turkish. Critics who claim that the series is biased in favour of the Romans are clearly missing something. In this particular story the Romans are defending themselves against an attack, and many of the victims are civilians, so there's bound to be scenes where we sympathize with them. This is how good storytelling works, and it would have been a creative failure not to include that side of the story.

'Rise of Empires: Ottoman' is a powerful, visually impressive and absolutely bingeworthy series that will linger in my mind for a very long time."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,1st season good enough but 2nd has more inaccuracies,"Text: I removed my first comment because I hadn't watched season 2 when I wrote it. I am coming back since I have just finished it. First of all the 2 seasons differ concerning inaccuracies. The 1st one relies more on history apart from the fact that they avoid to mention that Constantinos Paleologos was Greek,as many of the greatest emperors in eastern Roman Empire,and they paid too much attention to Justiniani. Ok the latter might have been a very good fighter but he left the battlefield while Paleologos fought till death as a man of honor and a real hero. So HE was the legend and the soul not Justiniani. However many other facts are decent and correct. Mehmed was really smart educated and wanted to be a Ceasar not just a sultan. His mother Huma Hatun was not Turkish that is why they didn't mention her origin,she was probably from Greece or Serbia. Historians say that is why Mehmed was different from other sultans and much more educated Or maybe helped him his adoptive mother Mara who was from a noble family half Serbian(from her father)half Greek(from her mother). Mara was really qualified and built many churches too so the environment Mehmed grew up was civilized concerning religions and different cultures.

Constantinopolis was really difficult to be conquered that IS true but at that specific time the City was weak and the emperor abandoned and betrayed by his allies So I think all these things are present in season 1 one way or another But season 2??What happened ?? Vlad was NOT the invader he was a hostage while all his childhood so he did what he should do! He wanted freedom! And he was cruel but not against his own people I have never found any official source about something like this! He was cruel against the invaders that's normal not??

Moreover the direction tries to present that hostages live happily with ottomans. Yes ok sometimes this had happened but have you ever thought that they did not have any other option??they just try to survive this is not friendship! Vlad was much more than what season 2 presents! Don't forget that many people suffer from the taxes to ottomans they wanted independence and they had suffered a lot. Ottomans weren't educated as Mehmed,he was an exception. That is why Balcans remained so underdeveloped and we are still trying to overcome all this cultural damage!

Last but not least they mention Alexander the Great many times since Mehmed admired him as many others Caesars did and Napoleon some centuries after,but one more time without telling that he was Greek!!

We are still speaking the language he and his teacher Aristotle spoke,of course in a modern and simplified version,but nobody mentions his origin as in other Tv series! That is a little bit stupid I think Fortunately acting and battle scenes are really good I liked the actors for Mehmed,Vlad and Mehmed as a child I have seen this boy in another Turkish série he is talented!

So give it a try I think it is worth but in some points you will feel dissatisfied."

Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Fictional Documentary,"If you intend to shoot a docu-drama with some historians commenting on it, you need to base your story on the real facts.

This is not a docu-drama about Mehmet nor Ottomans; this is a story of the great defence strategist, mighty Guiliani.

If it's another legendary story; I could give it 8 (which I did because I respect the work done).

As a docu-drama I could only give 3 maybe.

A docu-drama should be researched well. This one was not. Where's the Orthodox Patriarch? Mehmet gave him the Ecumenical Power right after the conquest. This was the greatest wisdom of his time. And Mehmet was a great strategist, artist as well as an intellectual.

This story has very few accurate facts. That was disappointing."

Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Easily one of the best historical docudramas I've ever seen...which is many.,"For the most part, docudramas can have great acting and writing, but suffer tremendously from budget constraints that cancel those out entirely.

They can also have horrible acting and writing, and a decent budget.

Unfortunately, as any history buff will tell you, this is just part of being a history buff since most people could care less about history and thus rarely are historical works that aren't a World War special given the love and attention they deserve.

But, on the rare occasion, you do you have a docudrama that has both great writing/acting AND a big(ish) budget AND is historically accurate.

This is one of those.

If there is ANY field you simply have to give Netflix credit for, it's how much they support historical documentaries and docudramas, moreso than just about any platform does or ever has. Not only do they have a great selection of them, but a lot of the Netflix produced ones are actually quite good.

Like, who'd have thought, right?

However, what is MOST important to me, more than any other thing that makes any sort of film production ""good,"" is historical accuracy. And in this regard, Rise of Empires excels.

Anyone who says otherwise either doesn't know history or doesn't know what a docudrama is.

Here is a fact of life about history: We almost never, like literally just about never, have any idea the conversations that actually took place behind closed doors when some of the big moments you do read about in history books happened. We know this battle happened, this guy was assassinated, this mission was planned, attempted, and failed...but rarely do we know what was ACTUALLY said in the King's chambers when it was planned.

Enter: Docudrama. Take what we know for sure, and fill in the blanks. Sure, it's entirely possible many of the conversations in RoE never happened even remotely as they did in the show.

However, Rise of Empires, both season 1 and 2, captures pretty much every major KNOWN fact and event and portrays it with supreme detail, while ALSO making it clear the writers did their research on the characters they're writing for, and so make it likely that this very well could be roughly how these unknown background moments actually went.

As for historical accuracy, maybe with a few small exceptions, like seeing Mehmed II leading the front line of his armies into battle (when it was much more likely he stayed in the back commanding troops), or the bright, fanciful colors of Ottoman uniforms replaced with colorful-compared-to-Crusaders-but-still-dull ones, it really is quite accurate.

And as for the filling in of the blanks...imagine Game of Thrones, but without the fantasy and nudity. All of the political intrigue, espionage, family drama...basically the real life events that inspired GoT...are front and center here. Machiavelli confirms this stuff not only went on, but was quite common...why would it be any different with a man named Vlad ""the Impaler"" Dracula?

Are you familiar with the phrase ""real life is stranger than fiction?"" Well that phrase exists because of people like Vlad Dracula, and historical moments like what's seen in season 1 and 2 of Rise of Empires.

So, long review short, even if you aren't particularly a history buff, or have even the slightest interest in Ottoman history, if you like medieval battles and good performances, this really is a must see. We don't get many medieval productions these days, so you kind of have to take what you can get...and as of now, this is as good as it gets.

And, honestly, I don't think it'll get any better than this unless it's a big budget Hollywood production. And it's unlikely those will feature commentary from real historians and experts on the subject, so, in all seriousness, Rise of Empires is really quite a gift to humanity and history lovers alike.

Thanks for actually doing something that makes me not question bothering to keep paying for you, Netflix. I, for one, am grateful."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Great documentary,As a turkish person i thought that it is really non-sided and great everything was good the costumes the acting the special effects the battle sequences there was some flaws of course i thought guistiniani had more screen time than it should have and aksemsettin was not present in the show at all (he was always with sultan he was his teacher and mentore he convinced the mehmed to capture the city when mehmed thought of giving up) other than that it was great i recommend you to watch it it feeds you with information
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,The idyllic representation of Empires should stop,"I think the idyllic representation of Ottomans should stop. It's nothing glorious in Empires! If only we're thinking how the janissaries were formed, and you'll understand the sickening aspects of Empires oppression. The ""heroic"" janissaries were ruthless soldiers, because they were raised from childhood in a draconian structure, grabbed from the parents arms, usually coming from the Balkan countries as a direct tribute for the Empire, thrown in a foreign lands, forced to adopt other religion than their own religion. The irony is janissary could end up fighting against his own parents lands. But I still appreciate the producer tried with certain accuracy to take in consideration historical data ."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Vlad vs Mehmed,"Too bad Netflix didn't do season 2 about Huniadi. It makes no sense why Vlad hates Mehmed so much. His hostage time with the ottomans couldn't have had such an impact on his personality. People weren't that complicated then... If the viewers had seen Ioan Huniade's war with the empire and how Vlad's family was involved, things would have had more clarity and truthfulness. Plus viewers would have had the chance of finding out how Vlad's family came to be known by that name... On the other hand it's good that western civilisation has a chance to know more about this famous or rather infamous ruler which inspired Stocker.

Unfortunately, the Romanian historians invited to participate in the making of the documentary are not the most representative. Or were not given enough space to complete and explain the story...."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,What a great told story!,"A great story told about the Conquest of former Constantinople, renamed to Istanbul after fallen into the hands of the Ottoman Turks.

The ever long lasting Eastern Roman Empire led by the courageous Emperor Constantin XI Dragasses fights to survive once more against a huge army led by the young, ambitious and master tactician Mehmet II, in a battle that inspired many writers and poets since then.

This movie isn't far from truth, as it seems well documented and also well displayed as both a documentary and an artistic movie.

As a history fan, I give a 10stars rating without hesitation to this title."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,"UNTRUTHFUL SUBJECTIVE documentary, with great visual effects.","I gave it a 7rating due to high quality of visual effects. Moreover the actor playing the main character, Mehmed II, seems to be a great actor. Overall Production quality is good. On the other hand, the historical explanations, details are not really truthful. They made heroes out of Genoese and Venetians. ??!!! What about the story behind the conquest by Ottoman emperor? What was the emotional reason behind it ? Why are there no details about the christians' crusade wars? Where is the talk about revenge? Where is the talk about the importance of Istanbul ? Plus, Mehmed's mother is known, she is Hüma Hatun, she even has a grave! But this productions says: ""mehmet's mother is unknown"". That is very confusing! This whole production is mainly lacking the truth. I didn't find it objective at all. The history has been demonstrated as if it was a Spartans movie. What about the customs and traditions of Turkish people? This documentary is Really really brain washing !! Who the f. is Giustiani?? Why is he at the center of this documentary? For example why didn't we see more of Zaganos Pasha? Isn't he more important as the right hand of the conqueror?? Doesn't he deserve more scenes than Ana character? Why is the emotional struggle of Ottoman army NOT shown, why does this production heavily weigh in towards the emotional struggle of Byzantine fighters? This production is very biased. This is a documentary but unfortunately NOT OBJECTIVE and NOT TRUTHFUL. Where are the great Turkish historians who can tell us the story better? For example Professor Ilber Ortayli. He should have been involved in this production.

Another problem is with language. The narrator is great, he gives a lot of fresh air while watching, nice to ears. However the spoken English of all actors/actresses is horrible. I could barely understand what they were saying. I had to watch it with English subtitles. Since English subtitles is a must to be able understand, then why was the outspoken language between ottoman characters not in their own language? Why do our ears need to suffer? History is needs to be represented as it is. In the production they could have easily made: the narrator speaks in English, historians speak in English, Byzantine characters speak in English or Latin, Ottoman characters speak in Turkish. At least among each other. It was ridiculous. At one point Ana speaks Turkish when she is talking to Sultan Mehmed, Apparently her parents are Turkish so she does speak the language, but when Ana meets the wounded Ottoman soldier, she suddenly forgets Turkish and they speak in English. B.S.!! Net net, if season2 is in the making, it needs to be objective and truthful."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Turks Doing Justice to Vlad!,"""VLAD VS MEHMET"", Netflix a second series of docu-drama ""Rise of Ottoman Empire"". I enjoyed this historically depiction of the Vlad the Impaler real character: brave, patriotic, bloody, tragic yet charming... Finally Turks are doing justice to Vlad, showing what lead him to the point of infamous impaling his enemies. Daniel Nuta did an amazing job, I see so much talent and future for him. Superstar Tuba B. Shines as ever as Sultan's Stepmother Sofia, looking for alliance against Vlad. When will Romanians do something similar for our heroic character? He saved Hollywood more than once. In 2007 in a meeting Sony, I proposed a real story of our tragic king. ""Dracula Untold"" followed, Luke Evans did a great job as Vlad."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,A lie there another one here but,"I am 100% sure that not even 50% of what they told is real. There are so many things said wrong. I don't understand why the Ottomans are seen as heroes for so long, but considering that the director is a Turk, it makes sense. But I'm not going to sit here and do a bad review because I really liked both actors. Especially Daniel, he is made for this role, you could see the sparkle in his eyes, something special indeed. I hope we will have more series like this but with a bigger budget. And one more thing, use the native language of the respective countries as much as possible, we have subtitles, that's not the problem."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,wrongumentary,"It could be good if they cut documentary parts with so called experts (since a lot of those ""facts"" were wrong anyway. unknown mother of mehmet? 30 sec with google and u know who she was) and made it as fictional adventure show."
Rise of Empires: Ottoman,Loved it,"This is awesome. I didn't know anything about Sultan Mehmed and Vlad. I can't believe Dracula family was real. Their sons were raised with Mehmed. Only historians knew all these facts I guess.

I really loved it!! It's highly charged, awesome and epic battle scenes!! Superb acting by Cem Yigit (Sultan Mehmet The Conquerer) & Birkan Sokullu ( Giustiniani) and not to mention an easy to follow narrative on what transpired during that period and how Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans led by Mehmet II in the 15th Century at just the age of 21! Sure..it's not too accurate on few points or some infos haven't been included but enough to make one understands and keep ones interest and curiosity throughout the series. I'm so looking forward to the second season if any. A must watch."

The Great British Baking Show,An excellent show; far better than the 'destructive commentary' shows...,"I've loved most of the British shows that have made it across the water, and this one is exceptional! I love that they don't have disguised 'professional' bakers, just people who love this as a hobby; they do this as a true 'labor of love'!

Another aspect is the judging. They don't hide catty commentary or mean-spirited comebacks in the 'helpful' comments they give, they're honestly decent in their feedback and don't make 'authoritarian' statements such as 'this is wrong' when it comes to the taste of an item. Rather, they might say 'I'm not as keen on (whatever), but the design is lovely'.

Such a nice diversion from the 'reality' food shows in America! Pay attention Food Network execs!!"

The Great British Baking Show,A show to decompress,"Unlike typical American shows where the chefs are at each other's throats, screaming, fighting, competing in stupid challenges, this is just calm and relaxing. They all respect each other, the hosts actually know what they are talking about (Masterclass), and it's a simple concept. Three challenges and a clock, that's it."
The Great British Baking Show,DELICIOUS! Thank you BBC and Netflix!,"Yep, 9 stars for a cooking show! Even I'm surprised at that. Thank you Netflix for bringing 4 seasons (series) to your U.S. audience. Please bring us more! I would love to see every episode since its inception. I had no idea Brits take their baking so seriously so this was a real eye opener. The variety of bakery items and the wide range of genuine talent among hobbyist home bakers is truly astonishing. This show has wonderful personalities in key roles, plus the contestants present us with their unflapable, always polite demeanor, along with a good deal of humor as they deal with the nerve wracking stress of their tasks. The contestants are all so engaging that it's hard for the viewer to pick a favorite from show to show. One contestant in the U.S. Series 3, Ian, could have his own tv show, he was that entertaining. Be prepared to get a craving for something sweet when you watch this."
The Great British Baking Show,This show NEVER disappoints! You will love it.,"Thanks to our English friends across the pond for creating this show! It's a fun and serious show, but the people always treat each other with respect and kindness (of course this no longer happens on American television shows). Me and my wife seriously love to watch it. It's slowly becoming a dream of mine to become a guest on this show :-)"
The Great British Baking Show,Absolute feel-good telly,"I love watching this show! I like that everyone is being treated respectfully and they're not trying to make a drama out of contestants' personal lives or try to up the pressure with stressful music, meanness or shouting or things like that."
The Great British Baking Show,Wholesome fun,Each season a group of lovely human beings gather under the tent to bake their hearts out. Everything about this show is wholesome and kind. Love everything about it!
The Great British Baking Show,Please no more Matt Lucas!,"I love this show, I've watched it from the beginning. It was a little hard to get used to Prue Leith after watching Mary Berry for so long and I still miss Sue, Mel and Sandy but I really like Noel. But I'm sorry, Matt Lucas is just horrible! He's not funny, half the time his jokes are crude and insulting. Hopefully when the 2021 season airs, they will have someone else. He tries to talk over Noel and is just infuriating! I don't know who the idea he would be good, but they were so wrong."
The Great British Baking Show,Regular people,"American here, a wonderful calm show. Comparing the show to the different American versions this is so much better. The contestants are just regular people and don't look like a casting director walked into a modeling agency asking 'who likes to bake.' There's no schtick with the contestants personalities, they are who they are and production doesn't force some ridiculous image on them to carry through a season. The judges aren't yelling at anyone but giving helpful advice. I LOVE the Technical Challenge where they get scant information and figure it out. I don't think the show needs a host much less TWO hosts who don't add anything and they aren't funny at all. No offense, they're just not needed. All in all a great show, so pleasant and the natural friendliness isn't forced."
The Great British Baking Show,Scrummy!,"American here. This show is fantastic. Watching through Netflix, and confused by the series being out of order...I think(?!) I also find Sue and Mary HI-larious! I adore all four of the hosts/judges and their dynamic. Absolute perfection! Lastly, I find it laughably ridiculous that some reviewers below found themselves ""put off"" by the one or two times a person on the show may have made an unflattering comment about the U.S.A. Get. Over. Yourselves. It's a T.V. show. It's entertainment. As an unaffiliated, moderate-leaning, 30-something-year-old, hetero, female, 1st-generation-college-goer, Democratic, cat-owner (because I know some folks like to keep track of their stereotypes and labels) I do declare, ""To all 'snowflakes;' if the art offends thee, don't look at said art."""

The Great British Baking Show,"Season 8, Matt Lucas","Love this show. I will probably always love this show BUT Matt Lucas is not a good fit. The problem is the addition of Matt Lukas (who isn't quite as funny as he may think he is) forces Noel to play the ""straight man"" and that is not a good role for him. Sandy was a much better ying to Noel's yang. Still love the show, just not as much."
The Great British Baking Show,"Love the show, hate the presenters.",I love love love this show but have found it really hard to watch now that Matt Lucas has become a presenter. His attempts at homour are appalling. They spoil the show for me and my family. He shows no empathy or knowledge of baking etc. Please please replace him with a better match for Noel. Sandy was good with him but Matt is naff. The computer says no!!!!!!
The Great British Baking Show,Hosts can't not be filthy,"The good for me: The baking element of the show is good and I enjoy that these are home bakers. It is nice to see 3 different rounds of skill challenges that focus on different aspects of the baker's abilities. The show seems to have a well-rounded variety of tasks that make it interesting to watch and instructional. The bad for me: Why can't the hosts just host? As an American watching this show, it is appalling when the hosts seem to only be able to make crude jokes about sex, genitalia, and the like. It's a baking show. If that's the best you can do for hosting then find hosts with some talent for crying out loud. Maybe the hosts could ask questions that focus a little more on the contestants or some history on the desserts or the challenges but the vulgarity is absurd. I would never watch this baking show with my children, which is quite sad."

You can get very attached to it and the contestants because many of them have such amazing personalities and its just great seeing all their amazing bakes. They're all so creative and look amazing! It's just an amazing show overall, it was a great idea and it's one of my favorite shows in the whole world!The presenters are funny and they know what they're talking about. This show cheers me up a lot, it makes me very very very very hungry!I definitely recommend this to everyone, of all ages! It's suitable for everyone and it makes you smile on gloomy days.

The Great British Baking Show,Love it with one exception...,"This is such a great baking show. I loved it most when Sue and Mel were the presenters. When Noel and Sandi took over, they grew on me and I continued to enjoy the show. But I just cannot enjoy when Matt Lucas is on camera. He is simply not funny. In fact he is cringingly uncomfortable to watch as he interacts with the bakers. His comments are most often childish and inane. You can see the discomfort from some of the bakers as well when he is talking with them and their laughs are politely forced. Why they kept him on for a second season I cannot fathom. I am sure he is a nice guy, but he doesn't fit here and I hope if this show comes back for another season next year (fingers crossed!) they part ways with Matt and get someone funnier and better suited to this show."
The Great British Baking Show,Pure joy.,"I was impelled to write a review in an attempt to drown out the homophobe and the rabid nationalist at the bottom of the reviews; pay no heed, this show is a wonderful celebration of talent, hard work and artistry from all kinds of skilled but novice bakers. I am enjoying the new hosts and mentors, although I do miss Mary."
The Great British Baking Show,"Great show, Noel and Matt a big NO","I've been watching since the beginning. Original hosts Sue and Mel were terrific. Good friends chemistry, they were empathetic and kind to the contestants. When they left, Sandy and Noel came in. Loved Sandy but Noel irritates me. Sadly, Sandy left and Matt came in. Noel ramped up his in-your-face chats with contestants and has gotten way too handy. He's made contestants lose valuable time by constantly indulging in long, silly rambling conversations. His creepy faces to the camera are ridiculous. Matt is slightly better but not up to past standards. Bring in some hosts who aren't as attention-seeking as these two guys! Loved Mary, love Prue, and of course, the big guy with a steely demeanor and soft heart, Paul."

The Great British Baking Show,Bring Back the Ladies,I've watched TGBBS since it was first made available to the US audience as the Great British Bake Off. I look forward to each new season. I've even gone back to rewatch past seasons. Matt Lucas is neither funny nor entertaining. He's downright annoying and unwatchable.
The Great British Baking Show,Love this show up until the change of presentors,"I have watched the different seasons three times, and enjoy it for a late night relaxation. I adore the mansion, the gardens and overall setting for the show, just lovely. The baking creations are simply marvelous especially the show stoppers. Such creativity! The amateur bakers are so intense on their work but often quite funny too. I loved and miss Mary Berry! She was so inspiring, with her cute little outfits and perfectly offset Hollywood's gruffness. I'm not as keen on the two new sidekicks and miss Sue and Mel's interaction and light banter with the contestants. The new guy is pretty annoying but I'm getting used to him. One thing I just noticed - everyone was wearing the same clothes for two days in a row?? Or is the whole thing is just staged in one day that is supposed to be taking two days? Despite the changes I hope it continues as it is a lot of fun. But I would be happier if Mary, Mel and Sue would come back next season...."
The Great British Baking Show,"Love This Show, But...","Not so much this season. I love British tv, and in years past this show is amazing and entertaining, but this year it's a bit of a dud. The judges and presenters are still fun to watch, but the bakers this season don't seem to be as talented, and the bakes haven't been very good. As popular as the show is, you'd think the show would have it's choice of fabulous UK bakers and all the contestants would be outstanding. This season makes me now wonder what their criteria is for contestant selection. Nothing else to say except I may not be interested in watching next season if it continues to.recruit mediocre talent."
The Great British Baking Show,"Please, please different hosts","It is just me, or are the hosts of this show becoming more and more irritating as the years go by? Having just binged seasons 6, 7 and 8, I can say for certain that not one word out of their mouths did I find funny or interesting. They are clearly there to distract and annoy the contestants, which it is clear they do. And they annoy me! Never have I used the 10-sec-forward button so much. Skip the lame hosts and false drama and get straight to the final products and the judging, which are always interesting.

The things that make the GBBS charming are still there--friendly, supportive contestants, bucolic setting with cutaways to baby ducks and butterflies, interesting and sometimes bizarre challenges, doing it all for a cakeplate, etc. But the hosts are killing the show."

Nasha Natasha,Sing along .... and learn,"Just great.... fun, catchy songs and educational (and not just for the kids!)"
Nasha Natasha,Very educational & Great Graphics/Animations,"Quite suprised to see a high quality content for childrens. Very educational and too many catchy original yet child friendly songs. Great characters fit very well with the brightful tone and exciting instrumentals. Great animations/graphics, explosion of bright colours and compelling voice castings. Its hilarious, adventurous and a bit of scifi/fantasy. No specific plots, just educational stuff, touching one topic per episode. To be honest, the characters reminds me of a mobile game. Totally eye catching for childrens and babies, even pets. Very entertaining even for adults, high rewatch value. Highly recommended."
Nasha Natasha,Funny + Entertaining!!!,"I am 31 years old with an almost 3 year old (oct), and he's addicted. I put on Netflix, he sees and yells for storybots, then sits and stares until someone gets hurt, then he laughs (moms sense of humor, lol). He repeats back to me things he learned from the show. And the clincher- I, yes the 31 year old, LOVE this show! I actually learn things from time to time, and I think it has quite a few funny moments!!! My only thing is, I'm not a big fan of the big purple one-their voice, their attitude, just that character. Also, sometimes it's a little too silly. For instance, its teaching really cool stuff, but kind of adhering to a younger audience."
Nasha Natasha,Awesome kids show- Super Catchy songs,"I have a 2 yr old and 4 year old and we are all addicted to this show. The songs are super catchy and we are all memorizing information about the Solar System, dinosaurs, principles of flight, bones in your body.. the list is long! I am a private pilot and I was really impressed with the way they display the forces of flight. Technically correct and broken down for kids to understand it. I really like Judy Greer and Weird Al Yankovic. And the guest stars are really varied and fun- ""How Does Night Happen?"" with Jay Leno ""How Do Airplanes Fly?"" with Kevin Smith ""Why Do I Have To Brush My Teeth?"" with Whoopi Goldberg ""Why Is The Sky Blue?"" with Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci of Garfunkel and Oates ""Where Do French Fries Come From?"" with 'Weird Al' Yankovic ""Where Does Rain Come From?"" with Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell I really hope that Netflix keeps making this show."
Nasha Natasha,Great family show,"We just found this and the kids love it. I liked the guest appearances (kind of a nod to the parents watching, as the kids have no clue who any of the actors are), and it was interesting for me as well as educational for them. Oddly enough, three of the episodes were questions my incredibly inquisitive 7 year old had asked me within the last week or so - night, airplanes, and the sky being blue; this explained so much better than I did!

The song breaks are fun (Chicken Bop is a new household favorite, especially with the 5 year old!), the different animation styles and the mix of live-action and animation keep things interesting, the bonus fun facts throughout the episodes are great, and even the little filler bumps with Hub and Bub get laughs from the kids.

The way complex concepts are explained through exploration and investigation and then further reinforced with a song is fantastic. This is one show I definitely don't mind my kids watching because they learn so much while enjoying something that's still fun and silly (but not so horribly annoying that I can't stand being in the room with it). I hope they make more episodes!"
Nasha Natasha,4 yr old loves it and learns,Amazing show. Please make more. My son has watched all the seasons over and over again and learns so much. The music is super catchy and entertaining. Love its
Nasha Natasha,Laugh out loud learning for kids & adults,"This show is hilarious. When my son watches it, the whole family gathers to watch it with him... seriously! Everyone from our 3 year old to his grandparents love watching this show. The songs are well produced and catchy. The different styles of animation (including claymation, which I adore) are all very well done. As an author of non-fiction picture books, I'm super impressed with how the science is explained as well. It's clear, memorable, factual, and never talks down to the kids. It introduces new learning in a fun and approachable way. The guest stars are also a fun addition. Really, the whole show hits a home run. I only wish there were more episodes!"
Nasha Natasha,We LOVE this show!!!,I really hope they keep making this show. My son & I love watching it. The guest appearances and songs are awesome. I've also learned a few things I didn't know.
Nasha Natasha,Great children's show! Entertaining for the whole family!,We love this show in our house. It's funny and educational at the same time. I like fun celebrity guest stars. The songs are awesome as well. They get stuck in our heads all the time. Hoping they make more episodes soon. My son has already watched the first two seasons a countless number of times.
Nasha Natasha,Story bots are the best,We love storybots here ! Even the grumpy nine year old loves it. Season two just came out and has already explained so many things they've asked and I didn't answer nearly as well as these little robots. I could never explain computers as well as Snoop Dogg lol
Nasha Natasha,Best EVER!,"This has got to be the most entertaining and intellectual thing I have ever put on for my kids. My wife and I sit there with them and learn too! It's fun, great songs and the topics are well laid out for anyone to understand! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
Nasha Natasha,Great show,"I learned a lot, its funny.everyone loves it ,it's not annoying.the characters are cute , it keeps kid's attention. There are celebrity guests !"
Nasha Natasha,I really don't get the positive reviews,"I loved the premise of this show and happily turned it on for my two boys - aged 4. Firstly- the delivery is so frenetic it makes a high octane Hollywood action movie look slow. There is a 2 minute scene of a lion bouncing around on screen making a series of weird and desperate noises which is enough to give one epilepsy, and I'm still not sure what it's doing in an episode about volcanos.

Most of the characters don't talk- they yell, and most of the time they seem insanely stressed out and so overcaffeinated they exude it from their eyeballs.

Every movement is a jolt, every expression and emotion taken to its extreme. The questions posed and answers given are lost in a quagmire of inane chat. Perhaps the point of this is to prime our children for the Internet age, where they have to sift through endless clickbait and distractions to get information.

If you are appealing to children, who biologically have shorter attention spans, why make a show 25 mins long when you could answer any questions posed (wrapped in a fun storyline) in 10 mins?

Just- no!"
Nasha Natasha,THE BEST!!!,"Perfectly wonderful show that captures the imagination, attention, and cleverly wraps it all in brilliant educational material of complex subjects for younger minds to grasp and enjoy!!! I love this show!!!! My husband told me how much he and our 2 year old laughed and learned!! Now the rest of our family gets caught up in watching along with the elementary and high school kids. I haven't seen such good work in a long time! Bravo! Well done! (They also have a sound track for the excellent music they've done! Don't miss out on it!)"
Nasha Natasha,Storybots is Amazing,"I have a 4 year old daughter that can't get enough of this show, and we really hope they keep producing more episodes. I love the questions asked by the kids and how the Storybots go about solving their scientific inquiries. Heck, even I learned a thing or two when I watched the ""Why is the sky blue?"" episode. They don't make it cheesy or dumb it down. They break it down into parts that are easily understood by toddlers and have great humor that is safe for kids of that age, but still funny to adults. The songs are great for this age group and short for their attention spans. My daughter gets up and dances to a lot of them. Just an overall wonderful show!"
Nasha Natasha,Intelligent and So fun for kids and adults,"First, I'm pretty selective. I have no patience for stupid programming, especially stupid programming aimed at children.

Storybots is smart, funny and memorable. Weird Al does a bunch of the music, but their are several other contributing artists. They have celebrity guests, and Judy Greer is one of the main characters.

Their music sticks with you"
Nasha Natasha,A family favorite.,"We've been watching story bots with our 4 year old since he was 2. He still loves it two years later, and out of everything he watches, Storybots never gets old or boring. Ofr him or us Its a fantastic show with amazingly cool music and subjects for kids. Its intelligent but well pitched for toddlers. Very highly recommended. Lets hope they make more."
Nasha Natasha,So Good!,"I absolutely love watching this show with my son and my daughter. We love the music my mother even sings along. My son has learned so much and now refuses to watch peppa pig, trust me when I say put this on for your little ones. We know all the words by heart and can't wait for season 3!"
Nasha Natasha,One of the better kids cartoons.,This is so much better than 95% of the cartoons out there. It actually teaches the kids things and I think I learned a thing or 2 myself. The songs are catchy and fun. My kids love it.
Nasha Natasha,Intelligent & Hilarious,"With two young children, I watch a lot of kid shows- all of which are screened by me and my wife. Storybots is by far the best of them all. It's entertaining, intelligent, and funny for both kids and adults. I never have an issue when my kids are watching a marathon of Storybots because I know they will always learn something. They also have an amazing list of guest appearances- definitely a bonus. Highly, highly recommended."
Nasha Natasha,Nostalgia Feeling,This is very nostalgic I remember watching this in my wolf ranch school it was very entertaining!!! I will recommend every Generation Alpha kid to watch this because us Zoomers are Watching Some of The Good Stuff while y'all are watching your Stupid Cocomelon or YouTube kids I want every kid under 16 to watch because the Amazing Actors/ Rappers That are In This Masterpiece of a TV Show I Want This Show to not Stop because Parry Gripp is a Nostalgia YouTube Creator I want more of Him I need him to not quit and not stop because it makes me Happy that they Still Going! - That Young Movie Lover!!!
Nasha Natasha,Fantastic!,"Great stories, lovely characters and educational topics all with catchy tunes. My autistic 5 year old is currently obsessed with them and I don't blame him! Each episode is just about the right length to keep a short attention span and they're genuinely interesting. My little boy has been able to learn all about the planets, shapes, colours and the human body - despite having real difficulty with classroom learning. I can't praise the Storybots highly enough.

Please make more episodes (and finish the collection of talking cuddly toys - we need Boop and Bing!).

Absolutely recommend giving them a watch - 100%"
Monster,,
Black,,
The Windsors,,
Masha's Spooky Stories,Fun spoof on tabloids,"The charming comedic performances of so many of the cast makes The Windsors great fun, particularly Hugh Skinner as Wills. He is ably supported by Louise Ford's Kate, Harry Enfield's Charles, Haydn Gwynn's manipulative and dangerous Camilla, Katy Wix as Fergie and Matthew Cottle as Edward.

The writers take the tabloid profile of the royals and twist it further. (Camilla is obsessed by continuing her own bloodline, Wills thinks republics are fairer than monarchies; Harry is a sex-obsessed illiterate fool; and Kate and Pippa are gypsies, with scheming Pippa willing to seduce anyone in order to get what she wants - often Harry.)

Not deep, not probing, but funny and different. Worth a try at least."
Masha's Spooky Stories,Loved it!,"It's been a long time since I've laughed as loud and as often as I did at this show. The caricatures of the royals were spot on, taking their foibles (as we all have) and stretching them into comic gold. It got to the point that all Fergie and her girls would have to do is appear on the screen, and I would laugh, knowing I would have a good time. The show is not perfect, but there's enough good stuff that I could coast through the parts that weren't, knowing a clever/funny scene was around the bend.

ERII, Prince Phillip, and the Cambridge kids' characters didn't appear on screen, but Phillip's curmudgeonly ways were represented in other ways, to great comic effect."
Masha's Spooky Stories,Hilarious!,"This show is simply hilarious and in many ways quite well done. It never goes overboard and the jokes in some cases are not too stretched. The Royal Family is portrayed for what it is and the value it adds. The freeloading, excessive behavior and spending and absolute ignorance is funnily portrayed. While the Queen herself has led a dignified life those who surrounded her and came after her have lived anything but a dignified life.

It is great fun and a good laugh to poke fun at the Royal family but at the same time being somewhat factual and not overdoing it."
Masha's Spooky Stories,"Horribly offensive, I loved every minute","Not since Spitting Image have we had a show the pokes fun at the Royal Family and British Government with such sharp wit and excellent satire. It's about time. Yes, it's incredibly offensive and disrespectful, but that's the whole point. I'm a proud monarchist myself, but the whole thing is so completely ludicrous and over the top it's impossible to not laugh out loud.

So nice to see Harry Enfield back at the top of his game, he's been sadly missed in comedic roles over the last couple of decades it seems (anyone remember Harry Enfield and Chums?). His larger than life portrayal of Prince Charles is nothing short of genius.Vicki Pepperdine as Princess Anne is another highlight, as is Kathryn Drysdale's re-imagining of Meghan Markle."
Masha's Spooky Stories,"Windsors, like you have never seen before!","12/30/17. What a hoot! I loved it. This is the perfect parody about the royal family, and royal watchers would definitely enjoy it. Great writing and decent cast and good acting make this a must-see. Can't wait for additional episodes!"
Masha's Spooky Stories,was hilarious,"Def a laugh and a few things said in it that we were all thinking .. esp about pippa being only famous/ known for her ""fantastic ass"" all the charecters look like the real ppl even camilla is bang on and the accents :) wonder if the royal family watch this and what they think ?? def worth watching for a good laugh :D"
Masha's Spooky Stories,Irreverant and closer to the truth than palace press releases?,"This show is hilarious and a great foil to the palace press barrage that the media regurgitates mindlessly, summed up beautifully by my favourite line of the series from Will (or is it Harry, they all sound the same to me): ""I love riding around on bicycles, wearing chinos and jumpers, and pretending to be like ordinary people.""

This is a merciless portrayal of the royals as a bunch of airheads, albeit mostly good-natured,but when your only real talent is being born (or marrying) into the right family, perhaps it's not that far off the mark. I'd like to say this is political satire at its best, skewering an anachronism that only undermines modern democracy, but really it's just making fun of a musty institution and its all-too-public characters. The impersonations are spot on and the irreverence is delicious."
Masha's Spooky Stories,fairly funny and surprisingly affectionate,"This is back after quite a long hiatus, with some cast changes and - to judge by the storyline - it's because it's been given a new lease of life by the recent shenanigans of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. The royal family are such a soft, slow-moving target that you feel the script must almost write itself, but it's brought to life by the fun performances and ludicrous accents. The satire, too, is ludicrous rather than malicious - it never really hits them where it hurts. In fact it's claimed that (non-specific) royals love the show and I can well believe they might, as although they are presented as useless and dim-witted it still makes them far more interesting and appealing than they really are. I bet Camilla PB, especially, has it in her Favourites.

It's definitely been one of the better Britcoms of recent years, and almost the only one that actually deserves a third series, but I think it's significant that it's a send-up; that seems to be the only thing British comedy can still do well (cf the undeservedly short-lived The Agency, also with Morgana Robinson, and The Goes Wrong Show)."
Masha's Spooky Stories,Stick with it . . . Hilarious!,Comentario no disponible
Masha's Spooky Stories,Funny!,"Funny! They absolutely nailed it with Charles and Camilla. They're both hilarious. Prince William was pretty good. Princess Kate wasn't the best likeness but was okay. Her personality seemed very different than that of the real Kate. I didn't care for their story line though. They couldn't have done worse with Harry and Pippa. Actor Harry looks nothing like the real Harry. Pippa's actress and storyline are terrible. And where's Meghan?

Princess Anne is a riot. Eugenie and Beatrice are a fun addition, but their story line isn't very well written. There's a lot of swearing which I didn't care for."
Masha's Spooky Stories,Plenty of gags but no substance,"The late Sue Townsend wrote the definitive fantasy satire about the royal family. Townsend was a strong opponent of gross inequalities of wealth but her books worked because they were written with an element of imaginative sympathy. 'The Windsors' can be seen as another effort in the same vein, but it's not nearly as successful. It's completely over-the-top, repetitive, tediously uses bad language to fill in any gaps in the dialogue (heavy music also covers up the flimsiness of the writing), and doesn't try to inveigh any of its characters with substance. There are a few funny 'Airplane'-style gags but the relentless one-dimensional nature soon grates. It feels like a series of sketches ill-advisedly stitched together into a series. Somehow I don't feel like there'll be a second one."
Masha's Spooky Stories,Watch it for Harry Enfield!,"Harry Enfield's Charles is pure comic genius, one of the funniest things I've ever seen on TV.

Every word, facial expression and reaction shot is comic perfection.

Every one of the actors is brilliant, though Enfield is a tour de force.

I'm not sure if non-Brits will get it, but this really is spot on!"
Masha's Spooky Stories,Vulgar but safe satire with heart,"I dont really laugh a lot at this show. The jokes are taking predictable stabs at the royal family. Often the joke is a royalty admitting their fault in some way. The jokes come at a frequent, quite tiresome rate and are very ""tell, don't show"".

What I like about the series is the expressive actors and the characters they portray. From the cartoonishly evil Camilla to Pippa the seductress, and the very strange man Charles. They are all good archetypes with consistent goals, virtues and vices. And after a couple of seasons I've actually astarted to care about these loony characters.

The plots are entertaining and sometimes quite touching.

The show draws on classic stage comedy with charicatures and clear, somethimes vulgar jokes. Most of them come across as inside jokes and are probaby mostly funny as an outlet to people who live under the real royal family. For an outsider, the show may be a bit of an oddity."
Masha's Spooky Stories,The kind of comedy appealing to audiences that are inflicted with borderline intellectual functioning.,"Unfunny and often tasteless, the kind of comedy suitable for borderline intellectual functioning, no wit whatsoever."
Masha's Spooky Stories,"AS A MONARCHIST, I LOVE IT!!!","Truly hysterical, well written and beautifully acted. The writers have simply exaggerated what we already suspect: Camilla is a scheming bitch; Charles is a Dumb, Aristocratic Hippy; Pippa is a crazed Social Climber; William is Nice, Well-meaning but ineffectual; Harry is thick as a brick but a lovely person who needs mothering; Beatrice and Eugenie are desperate for cash but bad at EVERYTHING: Sarah Ferguson is desperate to get back in favour; Andrew is after £££ and Totty; Edward is utterly useless and will clean windows for cash! I'm a fervent Monarchist, but we Brits have a sense of humour -- especially about OURSELVES. The programme is great fun and totally harmless. I bet the younger Royals think it's great and the older Royals will never see it. I'm just disappointed there are only 12 episodes!!!"

I found myself massively warming to it over the years to the point that I even went to see the ""Endgame"" play.

Masha's Spooky Stories,Great fun.,This is typical British humour at it's best. Great cast who deliver the excellent scripts with a straight face (and stiff upper lip.)

Throw in a few desperate actors and people might watch. And plenty did.

There is a semblance of a plot but the attempts at humour just don't work. The acting is fine, quite good in fact. But the script is just awful. In fact it might have been better had the sweary words been left out.

Magi,Epic Fantasy Anime!,"If you're a fan of adventure, action, and fantasy, this is the perfect anime for you! Magi starts off with a clever premise, it takes parts from some of the characters in the famous ""1001 Nights"" tales and mixes them together in an original, exciting story that will keep you always wanting to watch the next episode to see what happens. The animation is very good, and the dubbed voice acting is solid. If you're familiar with dubbed Anime, you'll recognize a bunch of the voice actors. Magi even has some good messages about friendship and choosing not to hate those who have hurt you.

Overall I would recommend Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic to any Shonen style Anime fans, Anime fans in general, and to anyone who just enjoys a fun, adventurous tale of fantasy and friendship."
Magi,"Magi: A jack of all trades, but a master of none","Before I get into this, keep in mind that this is a review for all of Magi up to this point, not just season 2.

When I was first introduced to Magi, I could only think, ""great, an anime ripoff of Disney's Aladdin."" Like come on. It's in an Arabian desert setting, it has magical blue wish-granting genies, and to top it off, one of the main characters is even named Aladdin. How they didn't run into copyright issues for this I will never know. But the more I watched Magi, the more I saw it grow into its own. I watched it meet, and often exceed, all of my expectations of what constitutes a good piece of entertainment. But looking back, I can't say I can pinpoint any aspect of the show that truly wowed me.

STORY - 7.7/10 There's no doubt that Magi has a very good storyline. It follows a journey through a surprisingly well fleshed out world filled with both dream-like fantasy and well-defined realism. Through this world, some genuinely interesting ideas about fate, class, and friendship are explored, and it's not afraid to get into the darker side of things. One of its most impressive features is its vast number of kingdoms, each with fully functioning governments and economies that really help showcase all the major themes of the show. But in general, the storyline seems to just wander around its world without any major focus or backbone, and it's often hard to see what it's really trying to accomplish. This also lets it drag at times, like in the middle of season 1 and and the beginning of season 2, where the pacing takes a hit. But overall, Magi tells a very impressive story, especially in the second half of season 2 where all its strengths culminate.

CHARACTERS - 7.3/10 Characters are a bit of a mixed bag for the show. On one hand you have characters like Titus, Hakuryuu, Morgiana, and Matal, who all have very engaging arcs and motives over the course of Magi. But on the other, main characters like Alibaba and Aladdin seem to pale in comparison. Alibaba's not too bad, but his characterization's pretty stale and it never really feels like he changes much throughout the story. And Aladdin, while fun for a lot of comic relief, doesn't really have much depth to his character at all. Side characters are similarly mixed, with some being really interesting, like Gyokuen, and others being comically bad, like Abhmad. All in all though, there's definitely more good than bad going on in the character department.

ART - 6.4/10 As far as the art goes, it's pretty good. Like I said earlier, the world has some interesting settings which look nice and colorful. There's nothing mind-blowing going on here though. The fights generally look pretty average, with some being better and some being worse. It does the job and it's more than good enough.

SOUNTRACK - 5.3/10 The soundtrack also does the trick, but it definitely leans towards a more average quality. It isn't very memorable at all and listening to it alone doesn't do much for me. I'll give it some points for matching the Arabian aesthetic and for combining a lot of different instruments and voices. The voice acting is also sufficient, but nothing really stood out there either. Same for its openings and endings.

OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 7.4/10 So in the end, did Magi end up being a diamond in the rough? (Heh, see what I did there Aladdin fans?). I'd certainly say so. It's really got no bad aspects, and for what little it may lack in art and sound, it more than makes up for with its gripping storyline and broad range of well developed characters. While I can't say that its ideas changed my life or that its moments moved me to tears, I'm confident that it'll satisfy anyone who's looking for some high quality entertainment."
Magi,Surprisingly good.,"Pros: Nice animation Complex storyline Outcomes are not obvious A lot of different players used well Decent character backgrounds

Meh: Many fights are won because of the script instead of skill. Usage of Arabian Night story names can be confusing at first.

Cons: Things are hard only the first time, then it's easy for everyone Some histories make no sense Innuendo thrown in for jokes, for the most part, detract from the story.

There are three seasons and each season has its own name. Season 1 is Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic, Season 2 continues the story as Magi: The Kingdom of Magic, Season 3 is a prequel about Sinbad, telling the first half of his story. Personally, i rate the first season as 8/10, the second season as 9/10, and the third as 7/10. The first season tells a decent story of its own and then sets up for Season 2, so overall, 9/10.

The animation in the show is pretty standard, it's the story that makes it decent, and the intrigue and philosophical issues that make it shine. It's not deeply philosophical or anything like that, but in the course of the story it touches upon slavery, revenge, classed societies, blind allegiance, and redemption, and many other topics. Most of these are shown in histories and given as reasons for acting this way or that, and in most cases, they spend at least a moment showing both sides of the argument and how people react to them. I don't know if this was all intended to be looked at that way, though it is an impressive amount of ideas that i only noticed in retrospect.

The story itself incorporates a lot of ideas. Arabian Nights plays a role in the names and a little of the background, with Aladdin and Sinbad prominently mentioned. There's the magi who guide and choose kings with hints of the New Testament and the wizards from Lord of the Rings, and of course King Solomon and his wisdom from the Old Testament. In all these cases the names and perhaps one or two of the famous attributes are used in the story, but after that, nothing is really the same. The use of the good and bad parts of magic, and even how magic has affinities is similar to the Force in Start Wars.

After the background is set, a lot of the story revolves around the politics of various kingdoms, their ideologies, and how they do business. It can get hard to follow if you have a hard remembering too many things at once, but it's worth it when everything and everyone comes together. War is a fact of life in this anime, and cunning decisions are made quite well.

The background stories are given as required, and part of the story is discovery. The discoveries are given at the right time, so it's not like you wonder when will they tell us this already. It's done well.

There are a few points that are stupid though. Fights are won because the script says they are, and they just aren't interesting outside the graphics for the spells. There are bad guys that take forever to kill at first and after that someone can kill tens of them in one shot. It can get crazy at times as the story progresses, and you just have to accept it even though it makes no sense.

Another good part of the story is who the hero is. Since you follow one person, you root for him, but there are others with good or noble causes either at first or as the story progresses. That you do not know who is ""good"" and who is ""evil"" adds a nice complexity, and it is done quite well. It isn't like the ""complicated"" backgrounds used elsewhere as a cheap imitation of depth.

I don't think this series deserves 10/10 but it certainly has potential. The complexity and philosophical aspects that you come across in the story make it a good watch, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story."
Magi,10 stars! Great story. In my top list of anime!,"I love anime and manga. This anime was recommended to me, I first watched the prequel, Adventures of Sinbad and I fell in love with those characters. Then I started Magi. The main characters were different from AoS but I also loved them. I love the Arabic theme and how it actually ties into some ancient history. It's so interesting and unique. Then once I finished the anime I read the manga and OH. MY. GOD. I could NOT stop reading it. I read about 132 chapters in a week. Every free moment I got I was reading. This story is SO good and it gets even better in the manga. I really hope this gets another season because it will be even better!"
Magi,Excellent series,Comentario no disponible
Magi,the series is amazing of awesome,"first i want to start off with all the not so good things about they did with the series. first there were a few points were i felt like the arcs and overall story were rushed. secondly some of the good characters we did not get to see them as much as i wanted to.

what really makes this series deserve the rating of 8.8 is that the story was well planned out and at no point so far (episode 24) i haven't seen any fillers. the soundtracks and opening also add to this effect. most of all it is the characters and the overall goal that both became properly established in the second season than the first season. the new abilities and ideals in the second season the characters get in there world makes this series that much more enjoyable.there are so many more reasons why i would give this series and 8.8 but i don't want to spoil the plot for you."
Magi,PLEASE WATCH,"This is such a great show! I will say that I am not finished with the series, but honestly, this show is so good; I only wish there were more episodes!"
Magi,A little boring,"I got to the 11th episode before I realized that it I stopped right then and there, I would just completely forget about this show and not care at all to finish it. I never looked forward to the next episode and I never found it that interesting. It's just extremely unmemorable. It has the vibe of a comedy isekai but it takes itself too seriously for its own good, and the action isn't that great either. It's ok at everything it does, but it's not particularly great at anything. The only character that I liked at all really was Morgiana. I would not recommend this unless you are just looking for a way to kill time."
Magi,Awesome series! A must watch,The Magi series is an awesome series. One of Sweet's anime favs. Second only to SAO. You wont be disappointed!
Magi,A very interesting but a poor character,"I liked it from the start but after 10 episodes everything started to seem a little dull. Eventually I was irritated by Alibaba as a character. He is strong but weep for everything. Every episode he says he's useless.

He does everything except to try to become strong. As a whole i think the emotion in the character was overdone and unnecessary. Though I like all the other characters. But the story was fantastic."
Magi,it has a deep social problems approach,"It has a deep social problems approach

Worth watching.

Shows us the kind of things real history books try to hide from us so that corrupt real life governants, mainly in poor countries, can continue their abusive oppression and exploiting on the common ppl w/o being questioned.

The above mentioned isnt a spoiler, but a reason to continue watching it in case u think it is too kidish on the initial episodes."
Magi,Pretty good.,"Overall, this show is pretty good in terms of writing, animation, art, and literally every other aspect. I really enjoy watching it, but for some reason I get bored watching it so I'm just going to stop. Might come back to watch it eventually though. If I do. Then I guess I'll watch the second season. I would recommend watching this show, but I don't have much to say about it."
Magi,It should be more famous,Very few people knows about magi series it is underrated that we all know but if you watch it you will not find why it is underrated storyline 10/10 character development 9/10 fights 9.5/10 and it's ost are superb 10/10 you can compare it's ost with top 5 animes also it so badass. And you will love the Djinn Equip form of everyone if anyone is a fan of black clover then you will loved this for sure watch it for weebs shake
Magi,PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3,"This show/manga is amazing. Easily one of my favourite shows of all time. I absolutely love and adore the characters, storyline/plot, ART, and sound track of this series. The creators are incredibly talented. This story couldn't have came to me at a better time in my life and I absolutely cannot express how grateful I am for this masterpiece. I will recommend this to all my friends and continue to show my love and support in any way shape or form. If I could have one wish, it would literally be to see a final season for Magi: the Labyrinth of magic. Either way, Thank you for this <3."
Magi,Aesthetically Fun!,"Magi is part of my childhood. I remember going to a computer shop just to watch an episode of this, even though I had no idea what it's really about back then, but it leaves a mark in me that made me look for it now that I'm an adult. It took me ages to finally see it as a whole, but I made it.

Magi is a story about friendship, sacrifice, selflessness, and looking for a bigger picture. These are the themes that were highlighted in the series, and they were undoubtedly well executed in the story. However, there are also things that are questionable for the plot, such as the misogynistic objectification of women, slavery, fascistic attitude, and a few more, which I think gives the audience second thoughts while viewing it. In contrast, fight scenes and pacing are breathtakingly awesome; they're so aesthetically pleasing and satisfying to the eyes.

In addition, the characters aren't hard to get fond of, especially the three main gems of the saga: Aladdin, I love his innocence (excluding his perverseness), his trust, and his undying faith in the goodness of everyone. Morgiana, a girl who has a lot of potential as a character; she is strong, resilient, powerful on her own, and caring towards others, but I feel like she can still be so much more. I was really rooting for her to be the dungeon capturer too, but it seems that a narrative like that is never going to happen, and it saddens me. Lastly, Alibaba, even though he is far from being ideal, his love for his friends, his family, his dedication, his willingness to sacrifice, and his respect for progress are unquestionable, and that makes him interesting as a character.

Overall, the story may not be perfect on its own, but it sure is definitely something worth watching. I just wish and hope that we get to see more of what's next for them and for everyone, but it's still a good conclusion for the story. I am solved."
Magi,Nice Anime,"I hope it has season 3, and aladden is an adult and he has a girlfriend..😁"
Magi,Why do they ruin good Anime with cry baby whining characters?,"Great animation, then loooong drawn out soliloquy, then crying, then horrible reasoning, which last waaay too long...then great animation, then more bad reasoning that no real character would do, then more whine...then great animation...then bad plot holes, then great animation, then more crying....oh and sometimes they just stand there gasping while bad things are happening...then they are totally lost and crying at what to do....then great animation....then a McGuffin...then the characters seemingly pull a miracle win.....then some more whine with the cheese.

But then a great animation and a cool character or 2...only to be lost in the shuffle with more crying and shocked gasing. Soooooo emotional that they have to explain every emotion and reason behind it....which is sooooo not needed.

But then...more good animation and a cool twist...that includes more over explanation on some twisted reasoning that has to do with honor, but ignores everyother good human quality....then good animation.

Alibaba is just the worst.

You get the point."
Almost Happy,Nice argentine comedy,"It is a beautiful argentine comedy that shows the daily life of a divorced radio host who mainly talks about his life on the air. With a very particular humor, Sebastian Wainraich stars funny moments always keeping his serious face. It is very nice to see once again the beautiful Natalie Perez on screen."
Almost Happy,Very good Argentinian Sit Com,Everything that can go wrong goes wrong. That's the premise of the series. It's cringe comedy with a heart. I really enjoyed it.
Almost Happy,Absolutely outstanding... a dark comedy that is actually hilarious,"This sitcom gets funnier and funnier by the episode. It peaks with the arrival of the brother (Gaston, a heck of an actor!). Highly recommended.

I was looking for something funny after so many so-so shows, and finally found it. Here's rooting for a second season."
Almost Happy,Watch it as a last resource,"The show is not good enough to deserve a second season which will likely have. The script is poor, the acting is not top notch either, I watched it because I used to listen to the radio show ""Metro y Medio"" (Sebastian is a radio host and does stand up in real life). I dont think Natalie Perez(33) should have the role of Sebastian(46) ex wife Pilar, the age gap is notorious and I just couldnt picture them as a couple in the entire season but I have to say she does a correct job as an actress. There are some sparks of humor and I liked Sombrilla(Santiago Korovsky) who makes the show bearable with his appearances. This show reminds me in a bad way to Seinfeld (both do the same job in the show and real life) but It doesnt deliver a good product."
Almost Happy,Buenisima,"Guiòn es excelente, las actuaciones también. Es una serie simple con matices de humor irònico. Espero ansiosa la segunda temporada."
Almost Happy,Not worth the time,"I really tried to like this but it was such an amateurish production, with a childish script, just did not happen. Perhaps it will have more success in Argentina since the humor and political commentary is most applicable to that country. Not a sitcom that translates well enough to have a lot of global appeal."
Almost Happy,Great insight,"Into modern urban life in the city of Buenos Aires, where a rich mixture of ethnicities has yielded a thriving culture of the most varied range. The rather self-deprecating humor in the series, given its autochthonous nature, may go lost on international audiences but it might still be worth a watch."
Almost Happy,Excellent Comedy on a radio personality,"I enjoyed it very much. Sebastian is very creative. He shows all the weaknesses and strengths in his daily life as a live radio comedian. A third season is needed to continue with a good life history. We want Pablo Frabegas and Gabriel Schultz back, even Julieta Pink could appear. Thumbs up!!!!"
Almost Happy,Argentinian humor.,Loved this show but I'm a bit biased since I was born in Argentina. I live in the US since 1986 but I love Argentinian humor bit depressing but what the heck ...that's us.
Almost Happy,A Very Good Argentine Comedy.,"Wainrach basically plays himself but changes his name in this really subtle comedy series from Argentina. I might be misremembering but the kids who play his kids might actually be his or they're in the series but it seems to be based on his real life even down to the football team he supports.

It's very funny in a very understated way, the type of comedy and character that a Jack Dee or a Ricky Gervais would play and if Netflix did an English language version of the show starring either of those comedy actors then it would work wonderfully well.

Wainrach pays tribute to his barrio, his Jewish faith and to the great city of Buenos Aires which he obviously loves. Such a good show and one I feel a lot of British audiences could relate to. If you have come across this and want to watch a really decent comedy with depth but you are bothered about subtitles then - just give it a go, you might be pleasantly surpirsed."

Bridgerton,"If you've read the books, lower your expectations for S3",Comentario no disponible
Bridgerton,"Pretty, fun and thin","Fun for those who enjoy the frothy visual thrust, light story and modern casual take on costume drama. It's a trashy soap opera in a dream version of Regency. I do like the diversity in casting and experimentation in costume. Casting is strong. However I can't seem to appreciate this production as much as I wanted. I find the direction and delivery of lines tends to self conscious, loud, stagey and over the top. Also the soundtrack is the same thing again and again, pizzicato strings, not creative, boring that flattens depth of emotion or drama. Otherwise a heady trip with lots of short scenes whipping from one character to another. It's good, just not totally my cuppa. A pleasant pretty distraction."
Bridgerton,"A fun, dramatic, fantasty gulity pleasure.","As a 23 year old black dude, I actually liked this show. I honestly thought it was going to be a full on comedy, but it actually had a lot of dramatic themes. I won't lie when i watched the first two episodes, I was very, very confused as to why there were alot of black royals. I thought for a second that this was true, but if memories served me right, it wasn't. But then I began to understand that this is all fiction and a made-up fantasy on what if life was like this.

And I have to admit, I kinda liked it. Some people don't like the film because of it being politically incorrect. But there are HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of period dramas that are more accurate than this. So why don't those people just go and watch those? I think people just want to complain about something because human beings are never satisfied. Even some of the greatest period dramas that are pretty historically accurate has it's fair share of haters. I didn't take it seriously. I just turned my brain off and enjoyed the fantasy."
Bridgerton,S3 was such a miss,"Can we have the old showrunner back? Please.

There were only a handful of exciting episodes for season 3 and they didn't really make up for the others being so dull.

The plot structure they went for would have worked over at least 12 episodes instead of just 8. They clearly didn't want to give the romantic leads their time to shine which meant we didn't get time to fall in love with their love.

I think the assumption was that their friendship in was enough in previous seasons that we wouldn't need any time to buy their love. I need more time to see why after years they'd finally go for it. It was so awkward."
Bridgerton,Mainstream Wattpad Historical Romance,"Let me just start that I am a fan of the books so I am watching this as I did when I watched all the live actions of Pride and Prejudice, with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life, and I was not disappointed. Is it a masterpiece? NOT AT ALL. Is it accurate to the books? Not so much but they did get the heart of it. There's a lot of issue I find with it but somehow I still find myself watching it because I love the genre.

To note: If you are into the ACCURATE retelling of history then I'm telling you right now SKIP THIS. This isn't about the accurate retelling of history. So if the ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", the designs of their costumes, the way they acted takes you away from the story because of inaccuracy then you will have a bad time. This isn't a documentary. This isn't a biography. This isn't a true story.

Now first of, the books star different siblings so each season will focus on different Bridgerton with splice inserts of side stories. S1 is more steamy and shoves a more lustful play on their romance it's a fake love turned real love trope. S2 is a slow burn and might be boring for some as it is less steamy, it's an enemies to lovers trope.

Now. If you're into the book series do give this a try! Of course it wouldn't be 100% accurate but I did feel that it was very true in how romance book genre goes. It's like a whimsical romance. Glazed over. Or whatever term. Something like those Hallmark Christmas romance movies but with more mature scenes. Modern music made classical. They really brought to life the family dynamic of the Bridgertons. I love how they interact with one another as a family.

Finally. If you're just looking for a Pride and Prejudice or historical setting romance show then do give this a try! You might just like it."
Bridgerton,Well that went over like a turd in the punchbowl.,Comentario no disponible
Bridgerton,An excellent cumulative of YEARS of waiting for this.,"Here are my thoughts

#1. I have to note that I had reservations about this when I first saw the casting of Simon and other POC actors. As a black women I didn't know if it was pandering to my ethnic group or if it was for genuine inclusivity. And after seeing Simon on screen I must say that he is PERFECT!! I literally can't picture him otherwise (and I've been picturing him for over a decade. (I also have to say the same for lady D))

#2. I was surprisingly pleased with the Marina character (btw she's not new to the series. Just early). She will fit in like a puzzle.

#3. I'm enjoying how flushed out Anthony is. I admit he was a little 1D for the first book since he wasn't a main character so I appreciate that tv allows him more dimension and build up.

#4. The rest of the siblings are excellent too. The seeds of their characters are coming through.

5. The visuals, directing, and music reminds me of a TRUE historical romance book. This doesn't feel like a made for tv show. I love how they managed to make the colors so beautiful and vibrant unlike other historical romance movies/shows that have everything ""accurately"" bleak.

This series was my very first introduction to the romance genre of books when I was a little girl and I could not have asked for a better pilot episode. The characters, the chemistry, the intrigue, the intensity (this list goes on and on) is exactly how I pictured it and how I felt when I first read this series years ago.

To all those that worked on this series , everyone from the actors to the crew, your artistic talent has not just made beautiful period piece show. No, your artistic talent has magically translated all the beautiful things I love about historical romance books and the writing of arguably the most famous HR author of modern times perfectly to the screen and to that I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
Bridgerton,It is entertainment,"This is not a quality Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice type series, or downton abbey. This show is an exaggeration of those kinds of tales and it is pure fantasy, using the back drop of victorian english high society. Do not take it seriously and enjoy it for what it is. It really highlights the absurdity of that time period as well. I love the pride and prejudice series I mentioned above and to me this movie was like a guilty pleasure version of that kind of genre. Costumes are beautiful and they threw in some modern music played classically, so really, this show is not taking itself seriously as a period piece, and is clearly just having fun. Have fun with it and enjoy the eye candy."
Bridgerton,Thoroughly Enjoyed it!!,"Knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show, I gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning. By the second episode, I became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that I didn't want it to end. Although I loved it, to be quite frank, in a way it made me sad. All the diversity.. well, it made me see how the world COULD have been and needs to be. I eagerly await the second season!"
Bridgerton,Season 2: A dull remake of Season 1,"The costumes, settings, music are all beautiful, but we've seen them before. This season lacks the substance and intrigue that led so many to bingewatch the first. A gaping hole is left with the resolution of Simon and Daphne's romance. The love triangle between Anthony, Kate and Edwina feels forced, with none of the actors particularly charismatic. The heightened focus on Eloise is detrimental, with the actress' eyerolls, overreaction, and unrealistic conduct reminiscent of Anna Chlumsky as Vivian in Inventing Anna. The other subplots are so redundant that they could have been crafted from film left on the editing floor in Season 1 and weren't enthralling on the first go-round (e.g., Penelope's unrequited infatuation with Colin).

My rating of 6 is the average of a 7 for Season 1 and a 5 for Season 2."
Bridgerton,Dashing,"Eloise and Lady Danbury are by far my favorites but I liked it all overall, quite different than the book but keeping essential plots and the essence. I do love the diverse casting."
Bridgerton,"Best Actress ""Claudia Jessie"".","Claudia Jessie played Eloise with extreme class. Hope she continues to ""stun the stage"" in her future acting career!"
Bridgerton,they GOT'd the script,"Bridgerton showrunners took a page out of the Game of Thrones playbook, and decided to toss the bestselling storyline and just improv their own. It's always fascinating when nameless writers get their hands on a masterpiece. These writers' names do not ring any bells for the masses, they do not exist in the same sphere as Julia Quinn (or GRRM, etc.), they are nobodies. They have never been able to craft a blockbuster story, from scratch, on their own. So when they get their hands on a proven winner...they kill it. They kill it because their hubris leads them to believe that they can do better than the masters."
Bridgerton,Not as bad as many reviews say,"I read a lot of negative reviews. Especially about the characters that do not correspond to the era. To be honest, I think you shouldn't be too heavy on that. It's fiction and it just looks good. It is a shame that the first episode is the least fun. This would almost make you stop watching. Fortunately, I looked further, which I certainly do not regret. It seems nice and I am looking forward to season 2."
Bridgerton,"A long time fan of the books, and a fan of the show","I first read the books years ago and this adaption has done it justice. Perfectly cast. The people obsessed with the ""diversity"" should know that this isn't a factual historical show, but a version of Georgian history that lives in the minds of all of us who love this type of thing and really need to get over it. They also didnt play string quartet versions of ""bad guys"" or ""thank u next"" back in the early 1800s. Basically, it's what I've dreamed of and waited for!

Adore that they've kept the main storylines but complement them with lines that add, rather than subtract to the main line.

Thank you Shondaland!"
Bridgerton,Season Two was a Letdown,Comentario no disponible
Bridgerton,2nd Season,"Usually I find myself disappointed by second seasons of shows, especially when the first is so good, and as such did not have the highest of hopes heading into season 2. Having recently completed it I can confidently say that it's better than season one. What about it made it better I cannot say, though I am a sucker for forbidden romance and the removal of those awful sideburns made Anthony 10x hotter. The second season is a must watch with a thrilling slow burn and an incising story. I cannot wait to see how this show plays out and stand witness to each Bridgerton siblings season and the pages of gossip it will bring."

Bridgerton,"Season 3 nowhere near as good as 1,2","I enjoyed the first season, I loved the second season even more, third season was kind of boring, it go so boring I just read while it was running in the background.

I give Season One a 9. Season Two a 10 and Season Three like a 6.5 and I don't think the rest of the seaon will change my mind the way things are going.

The only thing that kept me interested was the delightfully subdued interactions between Francesca and John. I really enjoyed how their romance was so much different than the others, and not just a repeat of the same. I could see the chemistry in their interactions and how their love languages were so different to those around them, really refreshing.

As for the main story between Colin and Pen, BORING. It was like bad fan fiction. It was like there was no character development. I felt no chemistry between the actors. It was like they were just going through the motions to follow out a set outcome, and then they are just having sex in a carriage which would be scandalous for such a young woman.

I don't know what will happen in the rest of the season, but I seriously don't know how Colin could get over the utter betrayal of Pen being LW. It would be fan fiction bad writing to try and get out of that. If Pen gets found out for being a total life-destroying gossip who makes money of other people's suffering, and she gets a happy ending? I really don't know how it works out in the books, but this pushes my suspension of disbelief too far."

Bridgerton,Brilliant adaptation with a modern twist.,"Ever since hearing this was going to be made into a series I have been anxiously awaiting it. This series has gone beyond my expectations. I love the costumes, the pageantry, and above all the cast. Each character is very well represented by the actor/actress portraying them. I love the addition of a diverse cast. It in no way detracts from the story and makes it a beautiful representation of today's society. I was nervous at first that the move to the big screen would not carry over the beauty of the story but I am happy to say that I am in no way disappointed. This is a great series and I highly recommend it to everyone loved the books or just loved a great romance."
Sam & Cat,Great,"It isn't as good as some other TV shows and if I'm honest, not every episode is great. Most are though. It is rather comical but when you look at the other two TV shows that kind of brings this one together, victorious and icarly, this one isn't as good. It is still funny and for everyone, even though it is aimed at younger audiences. It is definitely worth giving it a chance."
Sam & Cat,An Enjoyable Crossover Spin-off Teenage Series,"This is a nice enjoyable series to watch. Yes, there was room for improvement to make the series even better but it was enough to be fun to watch. The cast was great. They really committed to their respective characters and to the storyline of the whole series. This series played a good part in helping build up the careers of the cast. This series also connected very strongly with the other teenage shows. I enjoyed this series. It revealed to viewers the many aspects of the life of a teenager. Viewers and fans of these teenage shows always learn something and see a real insight of the true reality of growing up and living life."
Sam & Cat,"OMG, Ariana Grande is hilarious!","I have not seen someone this funny (especially a young adult) in a very long time. I tuned in less than a month ago to see what Jennette McCurdy was up to and Ariana Grande's character totally shocked me. I had no idea what she was doing. At first I thought she was mentally-challenged then I read her say that she was playing dumb. She would stare into space and hesitate and wave her arms in the air and talk with an inflection that reminded me so much of Emo Phillips, the comedian (I could never understand him and I could not tolerate his inflection) or even Pee-Wee Herman to an extent. Ariana is so unique for her age and she's quick and an extremely good actor and comic. She is going to be huge at whatever she puts her mind to. (She is a better actor than any of the ""Friends"" actors were during their first two seasons.) I would give this series a ""10"" but I think the writing and themes can be poor. Producer Dan Schneider has a pretty warped sense of humor. Some of the stories and lines give bad examples to kids, imo: Sam and Cat are very materialistic, Sam's character basically hates people (eg. that part shocked me), and some of the other older characters seem very shallow. Plus, these characters do not need to be making butt jokes. (It's totally inappropriate for young kids.) But some of the stories, lines and sight gags are extremely funny! The acting and laughs sold me after the 3rd episode that I watched. This series had ""success"" written all over it due to Jennette and Ariana. (I would have replaced the writers if the series went on to a second season. I'm an adult male and I'll watch some of these adolescent shows for a change of pace just to see what they're up to. Lord knows Hollywood has been striking out with adult TV sitcoms and reality shows.) I can't believe that they couldn't bring Jennette and Ariana back together for more Sam and Cat!"
Sam & Cat,Brilliant and underrated,"Where to start? That's one of the best Dan Schneider's shows on Nick. Not many truly understand how brilliant this show is. Brilliant script and funny & creative writing. A homeless, Herb, who claims he is rich. A restaurant where the waiters are robots, Talented child-actors in almost every episode. And the unbelievable ending. BEST ending for children television. You CANNOT realize how absolutely brilliant this show is. Just watch it. :)"
Sam & Cat,Sam & cat review,Comentario no disponible
Sam & Cat,A weak Nickelodeon show through and through,"There are a few reasons why this double-spin off is a total miss: First of all, both Sam (from iCarly) and Cat (from Victorious) were foil characters on their respective shows, with the funny weird stuff to offset the more well-defined, balanced characters. Here we have two comic relief characters and no one to offset them. Look at 'Friends': The ill-advised spin off, 'Joey', was an absolute train wreck, because Joey as a character was not strong enough to occupy an entire show. Sam and Cat are just not strong enough as separates or together in this same way. Both Victorious and iCarly also had strong premises, whereas the premise of Sam & Cat is extremely weak. They're living together and they've started a baby-sitting service. That's pretty much it. There are a few throw-in characters, like a little black market-dealing kid, but none of them add anything to the already weak concept. Nickelodeon was grasping at straws trying to come up with a reason why these two girls would live together and what they would do. My biggest complaint, however, is that when you take Sam away from the iCarly cast and Cat from the Victorious cast, their characters are basically just annoying. Putting them together doesn't help anything. Sam is just a really bad person all the way around, and Cat is borderline mentally retarded. To sum it up, going from iCarly and Victorious, this is a huge step down from both. Not nearly as funny, or interesting, or relatable in any way shape or form."
Sam & Cat,A rush of nostalgia.,"I really REALLY hate Nick sitcoms, because they have a bunch of dumb jokes and uninteresting plot lines and characters. That's when I was introduced to Sam & Cat. Now, for those who don't know this is a spin-off in the Schneiderverse. Dan Schneider made some of Nick's popular shows like iCarly, Victorious, Henry Danger, Zoey 101, The Amanda Show and more that I can't remember at the top of my head. Which six year old me had NO IDEA in the first place that it was a spin-off. It was just one of those shows that would play in the background but something about it caught my attention so six year old me decided to give it a shot. I faintly remembered this show recently so I decided to re-watch it for the hell of it.

Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it as good as I remember? Yes and no.

But, I found myself liking these characters. Sam & Cat features Sam Puckett from iCarly and Cat Valentine from Victorious, meeting up with each other in Los Angeles and becoming friends. They decide to start a babysitting service to earn some extra cash. Right off the bat, the plot might sound a bit cliché but you can't really judge a show based on that, it has the be the writing that's good. Sam and Cat were just meant to be on-screen together because their dynamic fits so well. And the side characters are interesting too.

Dice J. Corleone is their next door neighbor and is known for trying to make a quick buck by occasionally trying to persuade people to buy something from him, I really liked him a lot more than I thought I was. Nona is Cat's eccentric grandma and is usually the one that helps Sam and Cat. Goomer is your typical dumb optimistic person who tries the make the best out of current situations and really funny at times.

The episodes are sometimes a hit or miss, that's why I gave it a seven rating. You might be wondering why this ended abruptly and it was because of pay disputes, personal issues in Sam's actress McCurdy's life, and feuds between the Co-stars. Which is a damn shame because this show had so much to offer. But give it a shot if you're and iCarly of Victorious fan. I'm not, but I couldn't be anymore happier."
Sam & Cat,Seriously?,"My 6yrs old daughter watched it, she likes it and laughs all the time. But the hell ariannas voice its really annoying! Does it comes with her character ? Making her voice sounds awful when she talks? I cannot stand hearing it so I told my daughter to use her headphone and forbid her to watch it"
Sam & Cat,"Great, but not perfect.",Comentario no disponible
Sam & Cat,It's ok,"Let me start off by saying I loved Sam & Cat when I was younger but i rewatched it again.and well there were some things that I noticed that made the show just ok.

First I hated Sam in Icarly because of her abusing Freddie (I'll save that for my Icarly review) but I will say she has matured in this show and is a lot better character and seems to care about something other than Carly.

If you watch some of these episodes you'll see that some of them are so unnecessary and the kids they babysit are so boring.

Some of the episodes are also very short and I love laugh tracks but they play that laugh track after everything they say.

Cat is by far the best character the Nona is so cringy and the theme song is catchy but I still grew up on this show and it should of lasted longer."
Sam & Cat,iCarly II: The Sitcom That Would Not Die,"So it turns out there's a sizable base of fans who couldn't bear to see iCarly or Victorious go away; hence the televised train wreck that is Sam & Cat. This show reeks of laziness--just one cookie-cutter plot or joke after another, mostly ripped from Dan Schneider's earlier shows. Kids may cackle at getting his ""in-jokes,"" but adults will wonder who's even meant to be impressed by turning Silence of the Lambs into a slapstick. Childlike physical humor is crossed with bosom jokes and 50-year-old pop culture references, leaving a mangled mess that's ideal for nobody. Spencer is replaced with Goomer, a deranged man-child whose acting varies from creepy to imbecilic. Freddie is now Dice, a graduate of the Josh Peck School of Acting who shouts every line at maximum volume with no regard for what tone was intended. The only jokes delivered to this verbal punching bag are about his hair, yet somehow he's filler for half of each episode. The remainder is covered by Sam and Cat, each eerily old with the latter shrilling like a Bee Gee on every line and the former delivering her one-note sarcasm ad nauseum. The laugh track roars profusely enough to wake somebody from a coma, and somehow the psychopaths the titular characters babysit are even more irksome than the stars themselves. This show began with one of its actors falling into a garbage truck; frankly, it should've stayed there."
Sam & Cat,After watching the pilot,Comentario no disponible
Sam & Cat,Good but not great,Not as good as ICarly or Victorious. It was good at times but overall it was missing the dynamic of a big friend group. I think they were trying to hard to live up to the other shows.
Sam & Cat,From the point of view of an adult,"This is rubbish. I have a kid that is 26 and one that is 7, so I have run the gambit of television directed at children. One thing I have noticed is that they are getting dumber and dumber. I love the music that Arianna Grande puts out, but the stupid affectation she adopted for her role as Cat makes me want to rip my eardrums out. I understand why the older kids (teens) like this; there are a couple of very pretty young ladies on it, but I do not understand the interest of the younger kids, because beyond Arianna's voice there is nothing even remotely funny here, not that I was saying her voice is funny. There are shows directed at kids that I can watch and not wish for myself to have a stroke, there are some that are enjoyable, this is NOT one. Nickelodeon used to have some funny shows on it, but those days are long past. Nick, get some new writers...

Avoid this rubbish like you avoid the plague."
Sam & Cat,More of the same from Dan Schneider - make of that what you will,"Sam and Cat is exactly what the title says - two characters from two of Dan Schneider's previous shows put together in one environment and left to have fun together. The two characters haven't changed significantly since their previous appearances on iCarly and Victorious, respectively. There are a few laughs scattered throughout the premiere, but even the laugh track seems aware of how frail the comedy is. Any longtime fan of Schneider's brand of humor will be satisfied by seeing gutsy Sam and ditzy Cat interacting with each other and other folks, but genuine gut- busting comedy of the kind that was more common on iCarly is nowhere to be found. It seems Schneider is simply going through the motions rather than trying to create something original and memorable, but as of the time of this review's writing, only one episode has debuted so far. Thus, it remains to be seen whether or not Sam and Cat can rise above mediocrity and come close to matching iCarly in influence and enjoyment."
Sam & Cat,Quote from Ariana Grande,Comentario no disponible
Sam & Cat,Irritable,"My 2 youngest daughters watch this shell of a show,and I'm in the background doing my thing and all I can hear is the most annoying voice on a character I have ever heard,it's like sucking on helium but backwards. It absolutely grates me,what dopey producer thought this voice was the way to go. If it's her natural voice then so be it,but if not it's utterly off putting...I haven't found anything funny on this show yet...I mock and try and imitate her every time my kids watch this show. I think I annoy them. Sam and Cat are definitely not characters that you would want your children to imitate or learn from in any sense of the imagination...Watch at your own peril and loss of brain cells..."
Sam & Cat,A Fun and Entertaining Teen Comedy,"Sam & Cat is a spin-off series that follows the lives of two unlikely roommates, Sam Puckett (Jennette McCurdy) and Cat Valentine (Ariana Grande), as they navigate through their teenage years in Los Angeles. Sam is a tough and street-smart girl, while Cat is a bubbly and naive girl with a talent for making arts and crafts. Despite their polar opposite personalities, the duo becomes fast friends and starts their own babysitting business.

The show features a mix of humor, action, and heartwarming moments that will keep you entertained from start to finish. The chemistry between the two lead actresses is undeniable and their comedic timing is spot-on. The supporting cast is equally talented and adds to the overall enjoyment of the show.

One of the highlights of the series is the unique babysitting jobs that Sam and Cat take on, which range from babysitting a very demanding child to saving a celebrity from a potential scandal. The plot twists and turns keep the audience engaged and guessing what will happen next.

The show also tackles important themes such as friendship, honesty, and responsibility, making it not only entertaining but also educational for its target audience. The show's positive messages and relatable characters make it a great choice for families to watch together.

Overall, Sam & Cat is a fun and entertaining teen comedy that is sure to make you laugh and leave you feeling good. It's a great show for teenagers and families alike, and it's definitely worth a watch."
Sam & Cat,somewhat funny but not very original,"Sam & Cat is a bit of a disappointment. It looks like every other show running on Nick right now and that's not very good. The Cat character isn't as funny as she was on Victorious and Jenny is just as dour. Together the two don't make for great comedy. The humor seems skewed for 5-8 year olds who have never read a book in their lives and don't want to. There are no original characters and no original jokes. Which doesn't mean it won't do well. It just doesn't have anything of value. The best thing that could happen to this show is lots of visits from the other cast members of iCarly and Victorious. Maybe that would spark the brains of the writers back into writing comedy. This looks like something slapped together to look like every other show on Nick. Ooops, I guess I'm repeating myself but the show looks like a repeat so it's only fitting. Seriously, how could Cat be so funny on Victorious and so boring on this show? Maybe it has to do with the fact that on Victorious the other characters were intelligent and so her ""dumb,"" ""literal"" humor worked. Here it just fits in with everyone else and isn't funny at all."

Sam & Cat,Dan Schneider is slipping.,Comentario no disponible
Sam & Cat,Love it!,This show is honestly one of the most nostalgic shows there is for me!
Sam & Cat,Dan Schneider has done it again.....,"This show is what you get when a senile kid show creator runs out of fresh ideas and borrows from past shows he's done. It's completely dull and unfunny. The jokes are what you'd expect from Schneider, rehashed and recycled fart and puberty jokes. The characters are retarded and make poor choices on purpose, the opposite role models of what kids should be seeing. The main characters are also constantly doing things to try to screw each other over. But the by far worst part about this show is Cat's voice. I really can't stand it, and half way through the show I want to bite the cyanide pill and end the pain. The high-pitched monotone voice Ariana Grande is making is really irritating, and will make you want to blast your TV with a shotgun. Stay away from this one and try to watch something that won't mess with your sanity."
Sam & Cat,I wish I could block this on netflix,"Arianas character, cat, is written to be so dense its not even funny. On top of that her voice she puts on is horrendously irritating. Because of this show, and this show only, I wish Netflix had an option to block shows on accounts so my son can't put it on the TV anymore.

It's not even bearable enough to pay attention and see if the writing and story is worth commenting on.

FYI my son is nearly 6 and I have tolerated everything from power rangers, Scooby doo (old and new), polly pocket, barbie, miraculous ladybug, paw patrol, Henry danger. The list goes on and on and I have never once not told him to watch something until now. Hell most things I even get into and actually watch with him and get him to fill me in on what I've missed."
Sam & Cat,Pretty weak with nothing new.,"Another low-brow, immature offering from the creators at Nickelodeon. The show generates a few laughs but continues to rely on slapstick comedy a little too much. I get it, it is a show for younger children but why must it be so brainless.

The show is watch worthy but the style is nothing new and a little weak. Sam Puckett bores me and although Cat Valentine is adorable there is only so much of her you can take.

Nickelodeon pick up your game. Putting two supporting actors together does not equal a star. Also a weird child grifter and a man who behaves like Forrest Gump does not make a supporting cast."
Unsolved Mysteries,Ominous and unsettling indeed.,"A very well made reboot of the iconic series, Netflix does generally seem to be very good at crime documentary's. Six episodes in Vol. 1 and these first six cases are bizarre and completely intriguing.

The production is sleek, low key and emotive. I also really like the reimagining of the theme tune.

If you like true crime and a mystery, I would highly recommend this new series. I can't wait for Vol 2.

I should also state that you need more of an attention span than that of a goldfish to truly enjoy these cases, as they are singular and focused. Unlike the original series. A change that I think here works for the better.

Great stuff."
Unsolved Mysteries,"It doesn't quite ""Stack"" up to the original","Someone commented that the revamped version of 'UM' reminds them of ""Dateline,"" which I find to be an apt comparison. Though I will say the first and fifth episodes are exceptions; the latter for more obvious reasons. The former episode was great and reminded me of the original series. Yes, it was a whodunit, but other aspects were brought in. For example, how was the victim killed? It was under very unusual circumstances and shrouded by mystery, oh and the Freemasons!!! Despite them going down a more ""Dateliney"" path for most of the other episodes, I still enjoyed the program overall and give them kudos for trying something different. 7/10...Good, not great."
Unsolved Mysteries,One story per episode???,"As others have said, this new format feels like Dateline. What happened to 4-6 mysteries per episode? We already know they are unsolved, so 52 minutes is a LONG time to spend on something with no closure. I do not see this one lasting very long unless the pace is improved."
Unsolved Mysteries,Why they blew out S4 ?!!,"Can someone help me to understand why they blew out s4 like this with horrible boring old story and a moth man ?!??

Like there is no real crime happening in the world ?!! So they had to dig up a case from 1977 and interview a bunch of stupid people about a mothman? :))) By the way I'm always wondering why all these supernatural stories happen in the us ? Is it the level of intelligence of average people or what ?!? From UFO, Big food, shape shifter or whatever mystical creature are all been seen in the united state ?! But Mothman ?!? It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard ! And why none has a picture of any of these ? Or a video ?! Fortunately everyone has an iPhone nowadays.... Soooooo disappointing...."
Unsolved Mysteries,Don't get the hate...,"Why are people complaining that there is no host? It's always better to hear the story from friends and family members. Just take it as it is and stop comparing it to the old series. I personally like slow paced shows/movies, so I have no issue with that. I guess people these days are used to instant gratification and no longer have patience to wait for a build up. The way this was edited and put together is quite alright. On some stories the police investigation seems quite weird, like they didn't really look into it that hard. But then again we do not have all the details. Overall a good series."
Unsolved Mysteries,Not the Old Show but Still Very Inreresting and Compelling.,"Not here to compare the old with the new. Obviously the prior speaks for itself and is iconic. That being said, the newer version still delivers the mystery, suspense, and Eerie experiences each episode. I recommend approaching the new installment with an open mind."
Unsolved Mysteries,Give me more!,"Finally, good content is being made again, or so it seems. They did good with this show, but future episodes need to be just as interesting. Please don't have so many murder episodes, though.

Netflix should open the floodgates and produce as many high quality episodes of this show as possible. Along with Space Force and a few others, I'd say Netflix has the best shows right now, alongside HBO. Keep it all coming, please!"
Unsolved Mysteries,"So... there are two main reasons I've watched two episodes. Wait, make that three:","1. There's someone actually named Pistol Black- Cool. 2. The men that found human remains in the woods had planned to meet up and ""eat biscuits"" together. 3. The theme song."
Unsolved Mysteries,More please!,We'll done revamp of the original but there are so many cases to be solved across the US that I am shocked there are not more episodes and seasons are slow rolling to create. This show is an amazing way to bring crimes to light and provide public ability to reach out if they know anything. Hope this show continues as over the years it has helped so many.
Unsolved Mysteries,Needs some work,"No narrator was a disappointment, couple of the episodes where grueling long feel like they could have made each story 30 mins."
Unsolved Mysteries,First episode Spoilers,Comentario no disponible
Unsolved Mysteries,Interesting.,"An interesting watch, I find this kind of storytelling quite strange, maybe because I'm British, but the thought of sensationalising real life crimes does seem somehow distasteful, but I'm sure we'd all want answers to questions concerning the death of a loved one, particularly when those answers aren't available.

The crimes are all fascinating, the first few in particular truly had my attention, the UFO story was BS, and felt really out of place here.

Entertaining as someone looking from the outside, but I feel for those on the inside, apart from the one guy, who has guilt written all over his face."
Unsolved Mysteries,My God season 2 is boring!,"Season 1 was excellent with a diverse range of topics and mysteries that had you talking for weeks. However season 2 is just the opposite, its boring and having to call some of them a ""mystery"" is a bit of a stretch."
Unsolved Mysteries,UFO episode?,Is this meant to be part of a different series? Comedy perhaps? Hardly an unsolved mystery. A very stereotypical American take on UFO's appearing in small towns. Ticked just about every cliché in the book. Particularly enjoyed the part where the chap talks about getting sucked up by a beam!
Unsolved Mysteries,Nothing to do with the original,"The only thing this show has in common with the original series is the opening credits and title. There are minimal dramatic re-enactments (and I'd barely call them that), no narration, only one story poor episode, poor pacing, and (for well over half an episode) little more than shots of slowly speaking people who knew the victim walking around and brooding, etc. Even ignoring the disappointment of not getting to watch a new Unsolved Mysteries (and the additional disappointment of now being denied that opportunity by having that franchise name exploited by producers who probably couldn't otherwise sell their series) it remains a highly mediocore crime documentary series when there are many better shows out there."
Unsolved Mysteries,"The XDDL Episode (#3, House of Terror), as Example of What Must Be Fixed","The stories of Allison Rivera, Pistol Black, the Brooks' family, and Lena Chapin's elder sisters are heartbreaking and scary as heck, but I'm concentrating on the ""French episode."" I want to demonstrate what Unsolved Mysteries *must* address next season (other reviews here seem to agree). Disclaimer: I might watch Unsolved Mysteries even if the Second Coming were broadcast on a competing network.

First, the use of drones. It is to this decade's cinematography what shaky-cam was to the last. Overuse kills the immediacy Robert Stack brought to the series. Some actors are irreplaceable, and Stack, who appears in homage in silhouette in the credits, is one. Drones make this rebooted Unsolved Mysteries TOO S-L-O-W. Stack's ""Untouchables"" aura and appeals for tips to the 800 number gave the original series an urgency lacking in this. Mystery is destroyed by dreaminess. ""God-shots"" from drones and slow-motion cinematography work at cross-purposes to why Unsolved Mysteries fanatics watch. We wanted to feel that just maybe, we could do something *right now.*

Second: the wildly popular French series Non Elucide has done at least one episode on XDDL (as the psychotic father is known in his country). Another wildly popular French series, Faites Entrer L'Accuse, also has covered this story. As with Robert Stack, two charismatic presenters narrate the story with the agitation this horrific story requires. Yet ""House of Terror,"" Unsolved Mysteries' take on a John List-style family annihilator, flows at the pace of a Jane Austen romance. In addition to wasting time, concentration on cinematography works to the detriment of the story by forcing the omission of elements essential to solving this mystery. De Ligonnes' mother's and sister practiced cult-like Christianity; Tomas had to be drugged miles away *in an Angers restaurant* for his father to bring him back to Nantes; above all, there's a very real possibility De Ligonnes' good looks and reputation as a womanizer (well-established before the family annihilation) make it likely some deranged mistress has been hiding him out for the last decade.

In 2018 and 2019, first in a monastery in southeastern France, and then in Scotland, ""breaking news stories"" announced De Ligonnes' capture. The saddest was of the French monk, a dead-ringer for De Ligonnes, whom several sincere locals believed was the killer taking refuge in a monastery, a possibility anyone who *really* knows the story will recognize as eminently probable.

But Unsolved Mysteries 2020 doesn't seem to ""get it."" Possibly drone footage is cheaper these days than other kinds. The Netflix generation of viewers will always demand faster, higher, more intense everything--which Netflix better watch, if it wishes to maintain a consistent audience over the age of 16. I am older and subscribe when ""grown-up"" material appears, because I have no interest in a streaming service devoted to superhero teens who travel through time. I rated this first season of Unsolved Mysteries ""10"" because I'm a diehard fan. I hope Cosgrove-Meurer, the fantastic production company whose call-center created a kind of internet before the internet, will bring back a tough old guy in a trenchcoat and a faster pace next year. Maybe even a French one."
Unsolved Mysteries,Episode 1... HELICOPTER?!,Why was there no mention the entire time of the possibility of him being dropped out of a helicopter? That would completely explain being able to fall through that metal roof and all the damage to his body. His vehicle could have been moved to that hotel and then his cell phone and glasses thrown over by the hole from the parking garage. That case was irritating that the police department was so stupid and just called it a suicide. Unreal...
Unsolved Mysteries,We feel addicted,"Once you start watching this documentary you will get addicted to it you won't stop till all is finished. The mysteries that will make you question HOW ? And WHY ? Beautifully explained, I liked the UFO part more because the alien secret was hidden from the public. When I thought of watching this I thought it will be boaring or this is crime show but when I started to watch I finished all episodes in 1day ."
Unsolved Mysteries,Interesting and captivating but missing something,"After watching 4/6 episodes currently available on Netflix I'm certainly pleased with the nostalgic feeling of interest and captivation accompanied by the original music and themes of the classic show hosted by Robert Stack. The recipe is missing an important ingredient however, in that there is no host to introduce, comment and conclude the stories. Don't get me wrong, I understand that this was done as the creators and Netflix felt that there couldn't be a replacement for such a perfect and iconic host, but this type of program isn't near as effective with the absence of some kind of a narrating voice to help the story along. This absence is especially felt in episode 3 which is completely in subtitles as well as episode 5 where some witnesses of a UFO and alien abduction on their own seem rather... unconvincing to say the least..

This won't deter me from watching the series in its entirety.. eventually. There just no shaking the feeling that you're watching a collection of true crime documentary like shows with nothing to tie them together aside from the opening and closing theme music, so rather than waiting anxiously for the next volume to come out or wanting to watch all the episodes back to back, I'm satisfied knowing that I'll be able to return and finish them up when there's nothing else I'd rather watch or do.

Overall I'd award this show somewhere between 6 and 7 out of 10. If it were titled differently and didn't contain the nostalgic elements I just may have gone harder on it, so I may have a slight bias here but none the less, it's certainly worth watching in my opinion."
Unsolved Mysteries,Not for people wanting nostalgia from 30 years ago,"It is unfortunate that this was titled after the original series since, based on some of the reviews, that has created wrong expectations. It is not a series of short clips for short attention spans to time warp back to the 90's. For this new series, each episode goes in depth about one case only. For crime fans, this is excellent as several of the cases are especially unusual. Unfortunately, in trying to keep somewhat to the original, weird ghost and UFO episodes are included but those are easy to skip through. Overall, the first two volumes/seasons kept me in an enjoyable binge watching mode."
Unsolved Mysteries,Very good but I am annoyed,"I love this show. I think I watched every documentary on Netflix with cases like this in Unsolved mysteries.

I liked every season and always watching it with so much interest, but, I don't like the last two seasons.

Now I watched season 5, episode 1 and I stopped.

Why? Because Unsolved mysteries turned into UFO, paranormal activites, ghosts, and etc...

Don't get me wrong, but those themes are not my cup of tea. When I was younger I was into that stuff but now, I find it boring and questionable. Not that I don't believe in such things, but only because this show became from interesting to boring. They missed entire field, if you get me.

I gave it a decent 7 and only because of good episodes that includes real life stories, and when I say real, I mean for sure-real.

Bye!"
Unsolved Mysteries,annoying and unsettling stuff,"Really great series , you will get annoyed as some of the episodes are quite clear who did it from individuals to whole racist towns that clam up , look forward to updates , arrests and new stories . a must watch"
Unsolved Mysteries,Feels more like a generic Netflix true crime show.,"The switch to long form, single case, episodes can really drag if the topic is a dud, which pretty much everything in the second volume is.

Most of these episodes explain the ""mystery"" then it's 45 minutes of drone shots of depressing small towns and forests, interspersed with people in poorly lit rooms being quietly sad.

It's also so true crime heavy that when they do ham in a paranormal episode it feels extremely disjointed and out of place."
Unsolved Mysteries,I'll solve the missing salon owner episode for you,Comentario no disponible
Unsolved Mysteries,Just ignore the 1-5 ratings...,"As is usually the case, anyone rating this five or less just needs something to complain about, and probably a hug. There are 23 years of the old show, and I encourage them to go back and watch them instead of using this as a platform to self-medicate. I don't think it's a 10, but someone has to offset the ridiculousness.

The show is great, the format allows you to get involved in the story, and it still holds on to some of the favorite aspects of the original, like the theme song. It's called unsolved mysteries, not unresolved anger issues. I just can't with these ridiculous people who think they are being so clever with their quips and crafted complaints.

Next season, please!"

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Amazing reboot,"I am a 34 year old dude who grew up on HeMan and I created an account here to say I unironically loved this show.

I was beaming when she first transformed. Chills.

My kid can absolutely watch this if he wants to because awesome role models are awesome for us all."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Very good show,"A very well put together reimagining of the old series. Certainly has its faults, but none so large it detracts any enjoyment from watching the show. It doesn't talk down to it's viewers, and I think any child interested in fantasy and sci-fi will enjoy this. I got real Avatar the Last Airbender feelings from it. Friendship and honesty stand in the face of powerhunger and manipulation."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,I wish there was a higher rating than 10,"I wish there could be more. No series in years has given me such joy as this one. The most clever, heartfelt, funny and gripping reimagined series I've had the pleasure to watch. So many great characters taken from their two-dimensional toy origins and made unique and memorable. The complex central relationship of Adora and Catra is one of the most compelling, and rewarding hero-villain stories I've ever seen. If you're coming to this show with a closed, bigoted mind, it's not for you. But if you want to see an empowering inspiring epic tale of friendship, love, loyalty, compassion, redemption, and courage, you will love it as much as I do."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Amazing show! Wonderful characters! Awesome animation! Wonderful homage to past classics!,"She-Ra and the Princesses of Power captured my heart. I was told about this show by a young girl who I teach martial arts. It certainly started out as a kids show, but I did like the ""Last Airbender"" so I kept watching and was soon hooked. The complexity of the characters and their diversity was a real joy. The search for the meaning of life and love by all the characters is amazingly present in this show. I loved the subtle and not so subtle references to other SciFi/Fantasy classics, and even some film noir. Kids will not know where that stuff came from, but it adds a lot for older viewers. The original Star Trek attempted to address controversial issues episode by episode, but She-Ra creates a real world as a single long story with continuity across the five seasons that maybe does an even better job of showing how we can achieve a better society thorough love and tolerance. As a married man in his 60's and father of a boy and girl, I am recommending this as my favorite show this year to everyone I know. Also, who could resist a cool girl with a sword!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Thank you so much (I am writing this fresh out of the last episode),Thank you so much for this Netflix. How I wish I had a show like this growing up. One I could relate myself too. One that is truly inclusive. Nothing is complicated in this story. Everything comes naturally. Thank you.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Wow,"Just finished season 5 and absolutely loved it. In my opinion this show is exactly what it aims to be: empowering, fun, and emotional. I can say honestly that I did get invested in a few of these characters and loved seeing their growth and where it led them in the climax of this story. I definitely recommend you at least give it a shot if it's even remotely close to your taste in shows."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Great show!,"This is a really good reboot of She-Ra.

The aging down of the characters and radical new redesigns take some getting used to, but I got to admit that this reimagining of the characters is superior to the original. We get a large cast of distinctive and interesting characters. What's refreshing about this show is that there are also a wide array of body types and openly LGBQT characters.

The show is able to do a lot drama and character-relationship wise. The biggest driving point is the relationship between friends-turned foes Adora/She-Ra (voiced by Aimee Carrero) and Catra (The Goldbergs' AJ Michalka). The latter in particular is a really-well fleshed out, sympathetic villain.

The overall story is handled really, really well with a fully-realized fantasy/science fiction world, humor, drama, and interesting plot developments. I'm pleased to say that not a single season drops in quality. The final one in particular is a superb conclusion. Also, the show does a great job of balancing filler episodes with serial plot elements, a lot better than Avatar or Voltron.

Only downside to the show is that due to the large cast (understandable since the whole thing is based on a toyline) not everyone gets their chance to shine all the time.

The design style in this, especially the simplistic character looks, wouldn't have been my first choice. However, it works in the end. I respect the detail given to architecture and technology and the use of color.

Overall, I highly recommend this."

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,One of my favourite shows!,"In the beginning I wasn't so sure but She-Ra and the Princesses of Power has become one of my all-time favourite shows. The themes and emotions explored are so raw, honest & necessary. The last two seasons were legendary, I've just finished the final episode & am in a puddle of tears. Thank you to everyone involved for creating something so special."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Season One Review,"First and foremost I must come forward saying that as of this review I have not watched the original TV show. I grew up in the 80s, born into a conservative Christian home as a preachers kid. I was not allowed to watch He-Man, but I was allowed to watch Thundercats. Explain that one to me.

So without watching the original series, or knowing anything about the universe as a whole, just take my review as a ""noob"" to this new series.

I watched the whole season in one day and was pretty enthralled from the beginning. It does have corny and campy moments, think Pokemon, and the story is not in depth, nor does it take itself to seriously, but it tries. Aside from that, it is a pretty good show and keeps you entertained throughout.

One of the best things about the show, at least as a gay man, it is very LGBTQ friendly. I also like the powerful femininity that is quite prevalent. Even though a lot of the female characters are princesses, they are strong and fight for what they believe in, which I think is an important lesson for children, both girls and boys.

It's definitely a kids show, but it is a great one. The animation is very anime, beautiful colors and interesting magic and battles.

I highly recommend this to not only children, but adults who like this type of campy animation. I wouldn't say it's brilliant, but it has great potential to become it. I look forward to future episodes!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,37 year old male and this is brilliant.,"Yes I am biased because I loved and grew up with he man and she ra in the eighties.

I unironically love This show and it has been a great ride and on the way to watch the final season. So excited."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,It's not the original and that is ok . . .,"Thoughts: I was a fan of all things filmation back in the day and I gave She-Ra a good watch hoping for some throw backs or some feeling of similarity. other than the setting and character names that is where any similarity ends.

Story: The Story was like all genesis stories a coming together of the princesses by She-ra while she struggles with her new abilities. I like the human interplay with Catra and Aurora and the theme of friendship. But the story writing was inconsistent and wanting. and there should have been . . . I so going to get flamed for this . . . The lesson ie in today's show we learned . . .

Overall: well done and the fresh take was worth the watch but if you are coming for nostalgia you will be disappointed. but if you are new to the franchise then yes you will, maybe, enjoy it."

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Diverse perfection,"This show is AMAZING!! It's inclusive and interesting and the plot leaves you on the edge of your seat. And the characters are so lovely, even though there are some that will make you hate and love them at the same time hehe this show truly is iconic and flawless! 100% recommend"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Great Show,It is a really good show it can get kind of long at the beginning in my opinion but the rest of the seasons are really good and the ending is very satisfying season five is one of my favorite seasons. It was so suspenseful and exciting. I really do reccomend the show! There is so much representation for lots of communities for example the lgbtqia+ and minorities. And it's a cartoon that is friendly for kids and it's really nice to see that there are shows like this that can be shown to a younger audience!! Love the show!! Wish there was more seasons!!
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Solid reboot,"I found this to be a smartly written reboot of the 80s cartoon. Kind of feels like the recent Voltron reboot except the show has a slightly more comic and lighthearted feel. It also does a better job of filler episodes, although there a couple episodes that are little basic, but hey it's a kids show. It's gonna happen.

The main cast is good. The big trio of Adora, Bo, and Glimmer is very strong from the start, though it is Bo who usually steals the show as a likable goober. I was surprised how fun and relatable the villains are. Adora's friend turned rival. Catra has her own group and they are surprisingly humorous. Catra and Adora's shared traumatic past is probably the most dramatic part of the show and really pays off. It's also refreshing to see the main/serious villain of the show Hordak played as reasonable and smart rather than a traditional short-tempered mustache-twirler. Only weak spot is that this show is overpopulated with supporting character princesses and most of them aren't as interesting as the main characters.

Not the biggest fan of the animation. No, I'm not one of those people complaining about the fact that they redesigned the character, I'm just not the biggest fan of this particular over-simplified art style. The character's chins are too long and there is something about the arms and legs that's off but I can't put into words why. Though I do give the show props for for featuring more various and realistic body types rather than promoting the kind of unhealthy view that heroines have to be slim. The backgrounds are flat in terms of animation style and color scheme, but they do put a lot of detail into them."

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,She-ra a new generation,"The voice acting in the tv show is great. I've never seen the original tv series since I'm only in my early 20's but I think that this show could be something great. It has a decent plot line. The animation closely resembles a Steven universe style which is something that I love. There was some comic relief and silliness in the show that brightened my day.

Honestly I believe that this show has potential and hope to see it develop in the future."
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Not Your Parents' She-Ra,"I'd been hesitant about writing a review for this show but with the 4th season under my belt I think I've finally got it. She-Ra and the Princesses of Power is a bold reboot of the 1980s cartoon. The plot takes some time to kick into high gear, but when it does it is more than enough to carry the story on its own. However the show's best aspect is the characters. Both the heroes and villains are diverse in background, and complex in character and it's amazing to see. The animation serves it's purpose well, nothing amazing but not bad by any means. In summary this show is way better than it has any right to be, and a more than worthy successor to the original cartoon"

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Fantastic!,"Avatar: The Last Airbender meets Steven Universe. This plot is solid, the relationships are compelling, and the design is gorgeous. Fantastic!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,"good, not great. Great characters/drama but they play war no consequences.","It has interesting likable, complex characters. It's an entertaining and fun adventure as long as you take it as seriously as a TV Y7 show deserves (slightly less than AVATAR or Dragon Prince). The art style is terrific. The animation is a little stiff but gets the job done for it's TV Y7 fight scenes. The lore is interesting but I wish more of it was laid out (where did Bow (just relized Bow uses a bow) come from and what's his backstory). The show is alarmingly gay... not that it's a problem... just a note... not a dealbreaker for me... If you can't stand the last 30 years of Disney animated movies this show probably isn't for you. It's easy to see that the people behind the show care about their work. Effort was put behind it. Update: Post S4 the show is still good. My issues with it are numerous but mostly inconsequential. They keep using words like ""occupied city"", ""under our protection"" or ""casualties"". The show has war but it doesn't treat it like war. War is sorta a background for the character drama which isn't bad on its own, but it makes the war feel like a game. Nobody's ever died. Avatar and Dragon prince treat war with the right amount of respect. The animation is more consistent. I'm not sure where they'll go from here."

She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,Lifelong fan of She-Ra and I found this amazing!,"I grew up with She-Ra and had the action figures, the books and watched all of the episodes on tv. My younger brother really enjoyed He-Man and we used to love to play together as He-Man and She-Ra who were also brother and sister!

Now as an adult, I collected all of the dvds for He-Man and She-Ra which are hilarious to watch now with the shameful one-dimensional characters and gender stereotypes. The obligatory mascot/jesters (Kowl and Orco) and the strange moustached macho men (Bow and Master at Arms). It's especially funny to watch the episodes where He-Man visits Etheria - and his sister for random adventures - just stepping through a portal at will. Etheria seems to have a 95% female population and He-Man is in peril of sexual assault from all of She-Ra's flirty friends - all with names ending in A, and wearing as little as possible!!

Anyway, when I saw this new show advertised, I was worried about this being another lame reboot. It looked a lot like the style of Teen Titans and I was convinced this would be ruined for me. I couldn't be more wrong!

This is such a funny, engaging and refreshing reboot - I've been absolutely blown away by the level of detail and the obvious affection for the original show. It is very tongue in cheek but the depth of the characters really makes you care about the new personas. It changes the conception of 'good and evil' and how most people in a military force believe they are on the side of good, Look at all of the staff involved in working for the bad guys in James Bond films or even the Storm Troopers in Star Wars. Loyalty is usually to those closest to you, and the new Scorpia really shows this the best.

I love the fact that this strays from typical gender stereotypes and it even explains the love heart that Bow wears on his top! The episode where you see him at home is hilarious - even more so if you remember what the original Bow looked like!

For animation, it is fantastic to have female forms drawn in non-sexual ways. All of the Princesses look so different, and female, but not like they belong in a Victoria's Secret advert! The Japanese animation style really brings emotion to them and even more so in Season 3.

My younger self was always very annoyed at how weak and lame Adora was as her own character. She would always trip over tree roots and sounded so pathetic when she talked in a soft voice. In this show, Adora is a strong young woman in her own right, and it makes you feel she is much more deserving of the She Ra mantle. The way that she interacts with Catra throughout these 3 seasons really develops and makes you care about whether she can reach Catra in the end.

There is so much I could talk about with this new show, and while I rarely write reviews, this inspired me so much that I felt I had to share it. I cannot praise the writers and producers of this enough, and I honestly didn't believe that anyone could make a better show than the original. I am 40 years of age and She Ra made such an impact on my childhood. Now after seeing the new show, I absolutely love how anyone of any age can watch this and still take something away. This gives positive role models, with realistic body figures and questions morality at an individual level - rather than someone being just good or evil. Even Hordak shows a softer side at times!

Absolutely fantastic and I cannot wait to see more!"
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power,This is how a cartoon is made.,It starts of weak and kinda by the numbers but it builds up into an amazing narrative of friendship and love.

Falling Inn Love,"Bad, But I Loved It","Totally sappy, cheesy, silly, but sometimes you need a movie like that, right? This had me laughing at quite a few moments, because it really was sooo sappy. It's kitsch, but you should totally watch it on a night where you are entirely ambivalent to what you watch, and you think to yourself, why not? If my rating was based purely on the enjoyment I received from this movie, it would be much higher."
Falling Inn Love,Oh come on. It wasn't that bad.,"Without comparing this film to every romcom ever made; and this coming from a homegrown kiwi, it was good in its own right. Love the use of the kiwi lingo and hows the film represents kiwi lifestyle in the ""wopwops"", as we like to say. It was relatable and culturally respectful, which made up for the not-so ""bad acting"" as everyone likes to point out."
Falling Inn Love,Sweet love story,I have to wonder if the other reviewers have ever watched a romantic comedy. A health relationship takes months to curate not just a weekend. I enjoyed the lead character. The balance of male and female characters without one being dominated over the other.
Falling Inn Love,Easy watching film but why have an Aussie as main actor when in NZ!,"Nice easy to watch film, I personally didn't think the acting was as bad as people are making out. It's a nice storyline and as someone who lives in NZ it's fun seeing all the little NZisms brought into the film. If you want something easy to watch then try this out. Just disappointed that they thought they could cast an Aussie as the main actor without getting criticism. At least cast him as an Aussie living in NZ Instead of making out he was a local."
Falling Inn Love,Heartwarming,"We loved this. Watched it with my 6yr old. Was feeling a bit cranky before but all happy & chilled after. A good wholesome film. Yes it's cheesy, but that's what we signed up for & it's also funny! Loved the goat"
Falling Inn Love,Jake is Australian!!!!!!,His Australian accent is all I can think about. Lame rom com if you're in the mood.
Falling Inn Love,classic rom com,"Not the strongest plot, predictable lines.. but not half bad. it was funny, and if you know what you are signing up for - a typical rom com - it isnt a bad watch, especially in terms of netflix originals!"
Falling Inn Love,No chemistry whatsoever,"I love romcoms but there was absolutely zero chemistry between the actors. Even the last kiss, it was just awkward! Why do you win an inn by just clicking an email and writing an essay. Best acting by Charlotte and the goat. Plus: the scenery of NZ."
Falling Inn Love,Typical romantic movie,"If you are looking to watch something not very complex and romantic with a bit of comedy, I recommend this movie."

Falling Inn Love,A place where everyone knows your name...,"Come on you guys with the low ratings -- don't be so critical and snobbish. Enjoy the sweet love story and beautiful scenery of New Zealand. The village and the residents were charming. Makes you want to live there. So what if it was somewhat predictable. The lead couple was attractive and made you root for them. The story was simple, entertaining, and satisfying, with a happy ending. As for the film overall, I found it refreshing because there was no swearing and vulgarity."
Falling Inn Love,Great film,"This is a fresh and nice movie, got to be a Kiwi to appreciate this we are different over here in NZ so the tale covers all that we can relate to great effort and a surperb watch"
Falling Inn Love,Like a really bad Hallmark movie,"Don't get me wrong, I love a good rom com but this really was bad. Such an amazing filming location and we didn't even get to see much of New Zealand. No chemistry between the actors, the acting was diabolical. I gave it two stars, one for beautiful New Zealand and one for the goat (who I think was the best actor of all). Surprised Netflix endorsed this. It's bad - avoid."
Falling Inn Love,An Aussi!!!!,"Why not just say that the lead male was an Aussi?

I can understand the American not knowing the difference between kiwi sayings and Aussi ones but it doesn't make sense that the kiwis don't.

Maybe the kiwi actors didn't want to rock the boat but I feel like someone should have said ""we wouldn't do/say that"""
Falling Inn Love,"A likeable, easy watch.","Wow, this film really seems to polarize people. Everyone seems to have become hyper-critical about everything these days, if a film isn't the best film someone has seen they seem to rate it super low and trash it.

For me this was an enjoyable rom-com, sure it won't win an Oscar, but why would you want it to.

A funny-heartwarming tale of a fish out of water romance which hits most of the right notes for me when watching a light-hearted romantic comedy.

Beautiful scenery and a positive and cheerful message with many enjoyable characters, including the goat.

My wife and I enjoyed it's feel good message and came away from it feeling happier for having watched it.

Also a great look at New Zealand and it's culture, especially as found in the more rural areas of NZ. As someone who moved to NZ from abroad, I can say that the people are nice like that.

I think a lot of reviewers thought that such a friendly community was unbelievable, I feel sad for them if they are so jaded."
Falling Inn Love,Horrible,"Problems:
same old story, which I love but so badly executed!
The lead actress is annoying and over-acts.
The scenes don't even flow together.
-There's no chemistry between the actors.

I love romcoms but this one sucks."
Falling Inn Love,Relaxing rom com,Easy to watch rom com suitable for the family . Christina Milian & Adam Demos performed really well together with a relatable onscreen performance mixed with predictable humour and romantic dialogue. Mix in a beautiful little town with stunning scenery and a funny goat makes it easy watching for the whole family . Few little cute life lessons thrown in and bang ! Great film .
Falling Inn Love,"IF they want you to HATE the main character, they did a good job","The movie is lazy swill. I will purposely watch a formulaic rom com sometimes just for easy, predictable, watching. There is something comforting about knowing where the movie is going... This movie however is so terribly written with lazy scenarios, an annoying main character, and secondary people who fawn all over her just because she's an American? I found myself hoping the romantic interest would wise up to just how terrible she was."

Falling Inn Love,Cringe fest,"Had to join just so I could review this and attempt to save people precious minutes of their lives. Really surprised Netflix even funded this. Probably up there with some of the worst amateur acting I've witnessed. The lead actor attempts at acting are truly cringe worthy and probably as another reviewer quite rightly pointed out the Goat was the best actor. Don't even waste your time, cringy, shocking, predictable, bad script and awful actors (apart from the goat). Give it a wide berth!"
Falling Inn Love,"Cute, feel-good romantic comedy","I loved this movie. I'm a little surprised at all the people who watched it and are leaving such negative reviews. What kind of movie did you think you were watching? No, it's not suspenseful or an Oscar winning film, but that's exactly what you want sometimes. It's fun to watch and makes you feel hopeful. I wish there were more movies like this. If you like Hallmark Christmas movies you will love this movie too. I know they're cheesy when I'm coming into them, but I enjoy them and they make me feel good. This one was cute and I liked the charming setting of New Zealand. Enjoy it and don't be so jaded!"
Falling Inn Love,Fun Film,"Not sure why there's so much hate for this film. Christina gives her best performance to date! Cute and fun. Reminds me of Under the Tuscan Sun (2003), only better. Bravo!"
Falling Inn Love,Exactly what you think it is,"This is as formulaic as it comes. I would be much more forgiving if the leads had an iota of chemistry. Watching them kiss was truly painful. If you want to see almost the exact same movie with leads who actually seem to like each other, watch Something New (2006) with Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker. On the plus side, the scenery was genuinely lovely."
Falling Inn Love,A bit misleading,Comentario no disponible
Falling Inn Love,"Not great, but...","There are tons of cliches in this movie, but it is an enjoyable enough movie. I thought the characters were likable and I thought there was chemistry between the two leads. If you go in without too high expectations, I think you will enjoy this movie. In no way is it a great movie, but not a bad way to spend 90 minutes or so."
Pets United,Not as bad as everyone says,"First off, movies have ratings for a reason...TV-Y7 means its not really meant for kids under 7. So all these posts about hiw this movie isn't suitable for their 2 year old..well duh...it says its not. Anyways, on to the movie...its a decent story with decent acting. It could be better but, I have seen far worse. It has a good lesson for kids about not judging others. Give it a try.. I mean..its not like you can't stop it and put something else on."
Pets United,great for 7 year olds and over,"These reviews are hillarious - Most adults hate kids stuff anyway but kids love this stuff, you know pets and robots what could go wrong? most western 13 yr olds are stuck playing GTA 5 or fortnite instead of reading so 5/10 stars because hey it keeps the kids busy for an hour and a half i guess."
Pets United,Not that bad,"The animation is decent, the story is ok, I agree its not pushing any boundaries, but its far from the worst animated film I've ever seen. I may be slightly biased as my two year old has watched every day, sometimes up to 3 times a day since its been on Netflix, she loves it."
Pets United,Its just sooooo bad,"This movie is just awful. Like, not offensive or anything. Theres nothing in there i would not want my kids to see. Its just bad. It feels like somebody fed the twenty most popular kids movies on Netflix to a computer and asked an algorithm to write a script. Then it was edited and retold by my five year old. And then the voice acting was done by whoever was available at the local community college. Cliche tropes is one thing, but this one is done with no charm, character, emotion, nothing. The story is somehow both standard cliche tropes AND makes no sense. The pacing is slow so there is no excitement, the characters are flat so you really dont care about anything one way or another.

Its just plain bad."
Pets United,Brain went numb after 5 mins,"This movie has absolutely no redeeming moments. No good parts, the most boring and useless hour and a half you'll ever spend. Watching paint dry or grass grow would be a better use of time. What Rodger leaves in front of the door to distract the robot doorman sums this movie up exactly."
Pets United,Wow avoid if you can,"Well all I can say is this is one of the worst animations I have seen in a long time.

To begin with the voice actors have no other emotion other than read as if they reading a book or maybe they thought they were all the robots. How they got Natalie dormer to sign on I don't know, she must have just been killed off on thrones and thought she wouldn't have got another job like all the other deaths off that show. Don't even get me started with the Ronaldo character and his voice that is just ridiculous.

Then the actual animation itself is pretty poor and would expect this as an early 2000 cartoon film.

As for the story that is just ridiculous, the story boarding meeting must have been a free for all, they must have gone we like secret life of pets, wall-e, big hero 6 and bolt and then I am legend and thrown it all together and well it is just a big mess.

The song with the crocodile, tiger and hyena has to be said is awful.

If you can don't bother watching this with your kids as it is no fun nor entertaining."
Pets United,"Really, really bad.","As the mother of an 8-year-old, I've watched a lot of bad animated movies in the past 18 months of the pandemic. This is easily the worst I have ever had to sit through.

The animation is worse than you get on cheaply-produced half-hour tv shows; the plotline is alternately incomprehensible and stupid; half of it seemed like just borrowed tropes from other, more successful films that were shoehorned together; and the editing is just bizarre.

In almost all the scenes, the animals are walking abnormally slowly - you end up feeling like the production guys said ""Guys. This thing is only 72 minutes but we promised the distribution company we'd get them at least 115 minutes of content. You gotta add 40 minutes, stat!"" There are weird, lengthy reaction shots (seriously, there is nothing weirder than watching 10 whole seconds of reaction shots between badly-animated animals, especially when there's literally no reason).

Anyway, the next time your kid asks you to watch a movie with them, I promise that watching Frozen II for the 11th time will be better than even 10 minutes of this disaster."

Pets United,"I don't say this lightly, this is the worst movie I've ever seen.","The entire plot could be explained in a few sentences. It should really be a 5-10 minute animated short and even then it would be unimaginative.

The animation looks good in stills but in motion it's awful. The editing is just bad. Nothing feels smooth or natural. None of the dialogue is interesting at all.

If I gave netflix budget animation tools to your average high school level writers and designers you would get this movie. Even then I would give them a C-."
Pets United,Worst animated movie ever,The worst animation I've seen in a long time. Story line is rubbish. Voice actors really didn't try.
Pets United,"Yes, it's pretty bad","Something obviously went very, very, very wrong during the making of this computer animated movie. The only theory I have that might explain its general failure to entertain is the fact that it was a co-production between three very different countries - China, Germany, and the UK. With three different cultures working on the same project, it seems that it couldn't be fine tuned to be satisfying to one (or any) culture.

The movie fails in two big ways. First, there is the script. It is an utter mess. There are many things that are not explained, character development is usually near zero, and there is obvious padding. The second misstep is that it is directed in a manner that is pretty much free of passion and enthusiasm. Things plod along EXTREMELY slowly, and when there is a scene of action or suspense, the movie is remarkably casual and unexciting. Even the music score throughout is held back so much that you hardly register it in your mind.

In fairness to the movie, I will admit that I wasn't unsatisfied by its visual presentation. While the movie didn't have a Hollywood budget, the movie looks fairly colorful and detailed. But even with an acceptable look, the rest of the movie is so tiresome and badly handled that it was a real struggle for me to watch the movie completely to the end. I think even young children will get some sort of feeling that the movie is being held back in many key areas, so even they should not be subjected to watching it."
Pets United,More Substance Can Be Found In a Vacuum.,"For me to stop and review something? It's preventing others from wasting precious time.

Premise is rock bottom - I mean so empty that I'm questioning a cartoon.

Pets, with their people, live in a robot town. That's it. That's the whole thing. Why?

My 4 year-old daughter will watch YouTube all day long. It could be Russians doing Frozen. It could be Elsa in German. It could be rich kids opening toys. I can watch some of those.

It's like someone in Europe randomly chose several Youtube videos, added some Tom and Jerry, put them in a mixer and shook them up.

I feel like the movie should have a disclaimer at the end (didn't get that far), ""If you like this movie, you were not paying attention."""
Pets United,Not worth seeing.,Waste of time and money. Unites all popular topics in one whole unlogical and boring film. Pets animations moves lack reality and consistency. Film full of senseless brutality and cheap humor. I don't recommend it.
Pets United,Brain dead watching,"All have been said I'm all other reviews. This movie is terrible , I mean crazy bad. No new ideas , no excitement, my kids are bored like watching a closed tv, and I guess there are more excitement on a dark screen than this movie.

If you saw no animation movie from the past decade you might find kind of interesting ideas, but theses are all stolen from real great movies.

Dont waist your time."
Pets United,So bad it made me angry,"This film is so terrible, I just don't know where to start. Its a bit like some home made youtube animation thats been made feature length. The kids gave up quite quickly. I was getting increasingly annoyed that something this bad somehow was released publicly, but thankfully the kids turned it off!"
Pets United,Excellent film for children and adults.,"A cross between 'the secret life of pets' and 'I robot', I really liked this film. Proper storyline and likeable characters 👏"
Pets United,Everyone dislikes this but I don't,Comentario no disponible
Pets United,Haven't I seen this before?,Comentario no disponible
Pets United,Pointless low impact boring and not suitable for kids.,"From start to finish this animation drags out every cliche with the least dynamic musical score I have ever heard. There is actually no story at all, just a pointless sequence of vacuous scenes that repeat over and over again. My son didn't laugh once or show any emotion whatsoever. I will never get that time back. It wasted our precious friday cinema night. Avoid completely."
Pets United,"So bad it made it in the ""cats"" tier",Never want myself nor my family or even anyone I slightly care for to watch this trash movie ever again. After watching I just feel brain dead and frustrated.

MeatEater,A diamond in the ruff,"In this modern age of reality TV and adhd, when it comes to media we get a constant blitzkrieg of information. Much of this comes in the form of advertisements and images furthering this age of extreme consumerism. Meat Eater is such a breath of fresh air! Breath it in folks. Steven Rinella is the wonderful driving force behind this breath of fresh air we get to breath in so deep. Yes this is a hunting show. But it isn't just a hunting show. It is a cooking show as well. It is many things, and that is what makes is so great. See the world, take in all these beautiful places you probably will never go. The greens, blues, tans, and white landscapes. The majestic animals. The hunt. The kill. The ritualistic carving and cleaning of the animals. The fire. The meats cooking and smoking. Me salivating. This show is great in so many ways. The most important reason is Steve's realness. He's not afraid to admit his hunting mistakes, he doesn't always get the animal he came for and that's OK because it's more about the journey to get there then the end result. Do yourself a favor and take this journey with him and become a true Meat Eater. You will be a better person for it."
MeatEater,The best true hunting show.,"Not ""one of the best"" but truly the best. His calm narration and respect for the animals is unparalleled. He doesn't hide with the ""unpleasantries"" of hunting like the cleaning of the animals. And almost always includes cooking the food as well. If you enjoy hunting or just want to know what ethical and realistic hunting is like, you will love this show."
MeatEater,Very good show,"This young guy shows how to use every part of the animal, nothing wasted. He also demos how to cook some great recipes with wild game

Well done! Liked watching the areas he went hunting, this is great show for novice hunters to watch. I am an experienced hunter, I enjoyed this show."
MeatEater,Fantastic show,"Steve puts into words exactly how I feel about hunting. He shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of the show and shows that there are hunters that hunt for food and not for trophies. He shows the almost religious experience of hunting so well. I can't say enough amazing things about this show. I recently discovered it and I have every episode. My cousins and I are planning our first Elk hunt now because of Steve and this show."
MeatEater,Best Outdoor Show on TV,"Honestly I think Steve is a fantastic host and hunter. I watch a ton of ""hunting"" shows and Meat Eater is by far my favorite. Not only are they entertaining, they are educational as well. No one shows the true outdoors and experiences of a hunter like Meat Eater. Most shows are about antlers which sometimes I don't mind but I really enjoy Steve's way of showing every part of an animal is a trophy."
MeatEater,Amazing Show,"Not just the best hunting show, one of the best shows out there, period. Lots of people love this show even if they have no interest in taking up hunting for themselves. It gives you a real appreciation on the difficulties of hunting and the amount of respect and appreciation Steve and most hunters have for the animals that are keeping them fed throughout the year."
MeatEater,Steven Rinella is an absolute badass,I listen to his podcast and watch his show on Netflix all the time. Great new perspective for non hunters and hunters alike
MeatEater,Actual hunting!,"He hunts, kills and eats (and show you how to cook) what he has killed. Really good show and he has a podcast that is really awesome too. He has an interesting way of talking that is really enjoyable to listen to."
MeatEater,Relaxing,This show was relaxing to watch. Kinda gross though but cool
MeatEater,Arrogant and repetitive,"I have zero issues with hunting. Watching Steve talk down to all his guests and flaunt himself as the hunting guru get old, fast. His lack of vocabulary and overuse of the word ""man"" makes a fun drinking game. This show has ran its course as Steve can no longer appreciate the diversity in hunting and cooking techniques from others. You may think he does as he reads the script written for him throughout the show, but if you're watching his actions and listening to his ""bruh""voice, you know it's not genuine. Time for some fresh meat with a new host. Steve needs to go."
MeatEater,One of my favourite shows,"I've never hunted, but this show has inspired something inside me. It's like Departures with meat. Fantastic visuals, philosophy, cooking, nature and something very primal. I'm in love with this show."
MeatEater,"Honest, likable, informative","Steve is a very down to earth guy. Kind, skilled and a good writer. He needs to think about where to take the show next if he wants to grow and maintain his audience. Think about how Jerry Seinfeld brings in guests for Comedians in Cars getting Coffee. We learn about the people and see them perform (even though it looks like casual conversation, they are performing). If Steve could have more guests and more exciting recipes and a broader array of guests of various ages, ethnicity and cultures that might inject some new life into the show. There may be other models for this as well. But it's repetitive, understandably but that doesn't mean he can't add some excitement."
MeatEater,Monsters kill animals,"Hunting is disgusting, and this movie is disgusting beyond imagination. Just monsters who kill animals for fun, for money, for no reason. I do not understand how anyone can justify such cruelty to animals in XXI century."
MeatEater,Great show,"Awesome hunting show, a must see for anyone! Rinella is good at what he does and the show demonstrates that."
MeatEater,A Great Start,"This show, hosted by Steve Rinella, is a great start to bridging the cognitive dissonance between the harvester and the consumer. People seldom reflect on what hunting is and what purpose it serves. It is more than a pursuit to fill some egotistical void. Conveying that face to face reverent respect for the delicate balance between life and death becomes intimately subject to the beholder. That somber sobering success of harvesting an animal that is earned through the trials and tribulations of countless missed opportunities and empty game bags. Those tears of joy, symbiotically fused with tears of sadness as a life lay in warm motionless offering to the needs of the steward. It becomes unsavory to me to think that I could thumb down, and package all that it truly is. But one thing I can say is that this chase between predator and prey brings about powerful palatable reverence for how hunting holds an irrevocable pedestal in a world where our food is a near hop skip and scoot from our front door. It takes a show like this to give people's ""minds-eye"" the ability to wander into those shoes. I applaud the work of his entire crew and its effect on wildlife/public land conservation. I hope to see it grow in the years to come."
MeatEater,I have learned so much.,"As a new and frowning hunter this show has been downright educational in the sense that Steven rinella is going the distance and doing it right by following ALL state and local laws everywhere he hunts.

The value of conservation is presented in the most educational manner and informs the average American of how very special and significant hunters are to conservation and wildlife protection.

Furthermore whenever an animal is hunted it is always cared for properly and never, I will say again NEVER, disrespected. Most of the animal is used and waste is kept to a minimum.

The show is top notch and I'm addicted to it. If you have an interest or are a hunter this show is up your alley. Plus you can also learn how to prepare fancy dishes.

It is sad to see low star reviews from individuals that just attack the show and it's viewers based off an ancient ritual. The hunt. The true cruelty is when animals are forced to live in factory farms and are inhumanly treated, often succumbing to a slow demise. Yes to hunt you must kill but all shots taken by these hunters are ethical to ensure minimal suffering.

Thank you to the team at meateater for such an inspirational and educational show."
MeatEater,Amazing show,"The host is so amazing that he explains so much stuff during the episodes and he also shows you different was at cook the ""resource"" you hunted or fished. Please check out the Joe Rogan YouTube with this host as a guest you will not be disappointed."
MeatEater,"Meat doesn't come from Walmart, you sissies!","If you're one of those people who are so spoiled by modern technology and convienience that you're forgotten that something had to die for you to eat it, and are therefore offended by the idea of people killing an animal to eat it, grow up. Whether you kill an animal or kill a plant, something has to die every time we eat it. That's the circle of life. Don't whine about hunters being cruel! They work for their food, unlike the wussies who cry about animal cruelty yet have no problem eating a good steak. Farm animals are raised for slaughter and most of the meat that you buy from grocery stores comes from factory farming, which is nothing but a horrible existence for animals. And, for those of you ""I only eat free-range and organic,"" guess what, dummy! Hunting fresh meat doesn't get closer to nature than that! Get off your hypocritical high horse and either come to terms with how life works or go back to blithely watching ""food network"" while pretending that meat doesn't come from dead animals.

If you're a bleeding heart vegan who can't stand watching an animal get hunted, butchered, and eaten, don't watch this show. Guess what? You're not their target demographic. Watch something else and don't gripe about something you don't get into. Go eat some bean curd and watch ""planet earth.""

This is a show about hunters who are responsible conservationists and who actually take the time to track the animals that they're hunting. They eat what they kill and don't shy away from the work butchering. The skill and dedication involved in hunting is enormous. It's a neat show and both my husband and I enjoyed it. The nature scenes are glorious and the hunters seem like cool people. 👍👍"
MeatEater,He talks ENTIRELY TOO MUCH,This could be a relaxing show because the landscape is gorgeous and silence soupd make it even better but he talks NON STOP. By season 7 he has a huge chip on his shoulder and immensely disrespectful to the older gentleman with whom he is hunting. Extremely uncalled for.
MeatEater,I love the honesty and respect for nature,"I'm not a hunter, and don't even like guns in general, but this show is so authentic I can totally empathize with Steve as a hunter. I respect his knowledge, and his respect for the animals that he shoots.

I could never be a vegetarian either , so kudos to people who actually go out and kill the meat they eat, rather than buying it at a supermarket.

I have zero desire to shoot and kill an animal, but this show has reminded me of what it takes to be a meat eater."
MeatEater,Mediocre as far as hunting shows go!,"I just found this series online and have watched 5-6 episodes. To be honest, the guy isn't that likeable. And I was raised a hunter. I've harvested more animals than most who are reading this. So definitely nothing against hunting. I just don't find the guy very likeable. And the show format is wrong for a hunting show. It's condensed down into 20 minutes per episode. So all you're getting is the high-points. You're not going to learn how to hunt from watching this. Or how to field-dress game. Or prepare it. New hunters aren't going to learn much that's useful at all and old bears like myself are going to be disappointed. Anyways, the scenery is beautiful. The show itself, though, is disappointing!"
MeatEater,U gotta love netflix,"Well u got the conservatives up in arms about netflix green lighting cuties (which honestly everyone should be as it is pure garbage) and now u got all the bleed blue liberals mad about this show. Meanwhile netflix just rakes in the dough and laughs. What a funny world we live in.

As for the show, it's great. Someone complained about this guy missing some shots. Good. It shows he's human and normal like the rest of us. It's not fake with bs editing all the time. I'm not a hunter at all(more into fishing) but this show makes me want to start hunting. It's interesting, educational, and just a good show to watch with your family. I love the host and would love to go on a hunt with him and then cook up the meat and drink some beer. 'Merica!"
MeatEater,Best Hunting Show,"This is truly the best hunting show ever made, Steven is awesome to watch, you learn a ton and are just plain entertained. Highly recommended for hunters and non hunters alike."
MeatEater,Got me back hunting,"I started with the Podcast and then I realized they were talking about their show too. Only wish they were all on one platform. Totally awesome with one flaw, they don't hunt in New England."
MeatEater,Great show in general and best hunting show,"This show very well put together from editing to production and there couldn't be a better host to bring such a positive and mindful approach to hunting. Steve Rinella and his respectful excitement for nature combined with his knowledge just delivers a great all round hunting show. Hunting techniques, preparing the animals, cooking, and even some great deep conversations during the hunts. I really enjoy the constant respect for nature throughout the series. Can't say enough, great watch!"

"Out of Many, One",,
Soa,,
Ginny & Georgia,Decent show other than Ginny's annoying behaviour.,"Overall I liked the show. However, I found Ginny to be incredibly annoying with her spoiled and privileged behaviour. She is downright rude to her friends and mom. Her character has a lot of maturing to do."
Ginny & Georgia,No idea why ginny is the main character,"If this whole show would have been about Georgia it would most likely be a 10/10. Street smart and outwitting them all. She has such depth to her character, which ginny, the lead, is missing entirely."
Ginny & Georgia,"Very overly dramatic and cringeworthy, but somehow never really boring and even quite entertaining.","Season One: 7/10

Themes: Drama, Family, High School, Relationships, Fitting In, Mysterious Past & Humour.

Top five characters: 1) Georgia Miller, 2) Joe, 3) Marcus Baker, 4) Ellen Baker and 5) Maxine Baker."
Ginny & Georgia,The 2nd season is sooo much better than the first.,"After watching the first season 2 years ago I really wasn't a fan. The characters did not have the depth that they needed and the love triangles were just exhausting. I do understand why people wouldn't like Ginnys character there.

But the second season is something completely different. The way the series portraits trauma, mental health and day-to-day racism is very honest. The character building in season 2 is great and they added the depth that was lacking in season 1. The actions of basically everyone make sense in terms if their character. And if you still think Ginny is ""a spoiled brat"" and ""doesn't appreciate what her mom did for her"" you really didn't get the point. You can want the best for a person and still make mistakes, still cause trauma. Reacting to that isn't ungrateful, it's human. Especially for teenagers and kids.

After how season 1 went, I really wasn't sure if I wanted to watch season 2 but I'm so glad I did."
Ginny & Georgia,Looking forward to season two!,"This show has a very entertaining cast. The teenage characters are pretty realistic and have good chemistry, especially the four girls-it reminds me a lot of being young and having fun with my girlfriends. I could do with less sexualization of teenagers, but understand the show is being realistic about the lives of teens.

Georgia is a great character too as she is complex and interesting.

This show is like a mix of Mean Girls, Degrassi, Gilmore Girls and then something more mysterious too."
Ginny & Georgia,Ginnys behaviour really bothered me,"I'm not sure if this was the intention of the show for Ginny to come off this way but I feel half the time i love her and the other half I find her incredibly annoying. The way she treats her mom, and always sees herself as the victim in everything really bothers me. She thinks every time someone doesn't agree with her that's is either racist or they are in the wrong. She's closed minded while also being open minded and seems to have this idea that everyone else's life aside from her own is perfect. She's self centred and immature but thinks she's the opposite.

Again maybe this is the way she was to be portrayed because this is how a lot of teenagers can act, buy it often made her unlikeable and I often found myself not wanting to root for her.

Either way I think Antonia Gentry did an amazing job and her acting is incredible, and I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing her in other things in the future."
Ginny & Georgia,Great watch,"This season was a really great watch. I couldn't stop. I binged all 10 episodes the same day lol. The originality of the characters and their charm really pull you in and get you invested. Don't listen to the crazy Taylor Swift fans getting mad over one single line in the whole show of 10 episodes. I love T Swift as much as the next person but geez, calm down."
Ginny & Georgia,Yes and no,This is such a good show. It's a great one for parents and teens to watch together. The Virginia character however is absolutely exhausting... I am so sick of watching her grump through every scene. I think if she rolled her eyes one more time I might have thrown the remote at my screen. It's a shame because other than that it's a really good programme.
Ginny & Georgia,Surprisingly humanizing.,"I didnt expect much from this show. I anticipated a very high school level drama with superficial problems and i got anything but... this show has layers.... the characters have layers. Whoever designed this show has some untapped talent. As the story progresses you start to justify actions you would never make, and root for people because they deserve a chance and a change at life. This show is POWERFUL. Netflix would be stupid to let this gem fall away.

Im drunk and then i realized i require 600 characters to post a review on IMDB... so let me reiterate. If you are looking for a compelling, character driven adventure... this is it. Absolutely Humanizing."
Ginny & Georgia,it wasn't that bad but giving it a ten!?,Comentario no disponible
Ginny & Georgia,Cancel culture is TOXIC,Comentario no disponible
Ginny & Georgia,Not at all what I was expecting (in a good way).,"This show surprised me. It's more than just a teen drama. I appreciate the racially mixed casting and the delving into issues faced by biracial kids. All of the comparisons to Gilmore Girls are purely superficial and take away from the darkness that I felt this show did very well. I think the casting was really well done. I say kudos to the casting of the ""teen"" actors. They all looked pretty young (they looked 20 instead of 25-30 like usual in these shows).

If you are expecting something as light and fluffy as the GG, you will be disappointed. But if you want something entertaining with very dark tones and some pretty realistic teen characters... give it a try."
Ginny & Georgia,"Ginny is whiney, annoying, and angry.",It's really hard to watch this show even though I like the other characters. Ginny is possibly the most obnoxious tv teenager I've ever seen. She has a horrible attitude. I understand she's supposed to be an angry teenager but she comes across righteous and smug. Georgia is excellent though. And wish there was more Joe.
Ginny & Georgia,Great show,Hopefully green lighted for season 2!! This show was fabulous
Ginny & Georgia,Commenters are very interesting,"It's interesting how many of you adore the manipulative mom-child and cannot empathize with the daughter who has to deal with all of the chaos she creates as though she is not the child in this scenario.

I weep for your children."
Ginny & Georgia,Started Strong. Still want a next season,Comentario no disponible
Ginny & Georgia,Love the show but hate Ginny,Comentario no disponible
Ginny & Georgia,I loved this show!,"It's such a shame to see a great show take a hit at ratings because of cancel culture. So, to anyone reading this unsure wether to give it a go, if you enjoy an easy watch with great storylines and romance, I'd definitely say yes. I'd say the target audience is teens/YA but I'm pushing 30yo and LOVED it! The ratings have taken a hit due to a Taylor Swift comment and from someone who loves Taylor's music it's ridiculous that no one can mention ANYTHING anymore without it offending someone. Definitely recommend this series, hoping for s2!!"
Ginny & Georgia,"The Georgia parts are cool, the Ginny parts UGH","Georgia is a fun, mysterious character. Her son is cute. Ginny is just too much of a stereotypical tv teen, it gets annoying. By the end, I couldn't deal with the Ginny lines."
Ginny & Georgia,I liked it,I really like it. Its more realistic than most shows. People in some of these reviews want fantasy but to be honest this show touches base on how teenagers really are these days.
Ginny & Georgia,Sort of a Cliff Hanging Look At Life,Comentario no disponible
Ginny & Georgia,Golden,"THE TWISTS, THE DRAMA. Heartfelt, extra dramatic, wholesome and twisty. What a show. Teenage drama mixed in with some really provocative themes, important commentary, intricately bizarre story lines and some truly wonky characters. A mother-daugther story that is far beyond their own relationship which is born out of a stereotypical ""free spirit"" mom on the run storyline. It's chaotic in a wonderful way. Bless. waiting for a second season."
Ginny & Georgia,Ginnie is,"Why was ginny there in the show. She is the worst child anyone can ever have.. She has an extremely comfortable life with a mom doing anything and everything to make thier life safe and comfortable but rather than being grateful she hates her mom.

Why???????

She is shallow, sleeping with one dude, dating other, asking if for $100 like a cent, does not want to work for it but judges and hates her mom.

Georgia on the other hand makes you like her despite some wrong doings. The character as well as actor is likable.

I wish there was no ginny and only georgia.

Still a good watch for a weekend binge."
Ginny & Georgia,Ginny's character is unlikeable,"I absolutely love the Georgia character and would have loved if the show focused more on her teen years, but ginny is very annoying. Ginny is always playing the victim and her actions of juggling two boys, making everything about race and being so ungrateful to her mother. This makes the show for me unlikeable. Overall the show has a decent plot typical to a romcom type of serie."
Ginny & Georgia,AMAZING,"Honestly didn't think this show would be for me but I gave it a chance and it was brilliant, funny, wholesome, relatable, witty and the cast!! The cast are perfect! 10/10 would recommend

And the Taylor Swift fans rating the show badly based on that one comment need to relax. It's never that deep.

Can't wait for season 2!"
Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon Legends,,
Greenleaf,A highly underrated show,"There is heart in this show. Now, as an atheist I would expect that the religious aspect of the show would bother me at some point, but it doesnt. If you like dramas, and House of Cards-esque settings, this might be your thing. It really is a great show. Not perfect, but if you get into the storylines, it will keep you hooked till the very end."
Greenleaf,A Soap Opera....not a Series!,"This is a soap opera with the theme about the workings of a Black church. It has all the trappings of a day or nighttime soap, the woeful background music, the long, lingering glances and stares between the characters, everyone is beautiful or handsome, all walk around fully made up, even when they wake up in the mornings, etc. The dialog is ""soapy"", as are the sets that are filled with flowers, no matter the home in which the scene is set. It's clearly made for a G rating. As the ""seasons"" progress, it becomes more ""soapy"" and less interesting, making it really difficult to stay engaged. The story lines and intrigue lessens to the point of becoming a very watered down version of where it all started. Season 5 is basically a hurried attempt to wrap things up neatly, make sure everyone has a happy ending, and show a lot of ""woman power"". Not surprising since this was the focus of the ""O"" network. What on earth was the point of this other than to fill a slot on the ""O"" Network?"
Greenleaf,a fascinating world somewhat hampered by a conventional narrative,"The best of what Greenleaf has to offer can be seen in a family dinner conversation in the first episode. Ex-minister Grace has come back to the city of her father's megachurch for her sister's funeral, and mentions that she rarely goes to church in her new town. Her sister-in-law Kerrisa jumps on it, passive-aggressively asking why. Grace's mother insists on an answer, and the whole conversation devolves into a tense mess of resentment and jealousy. It is fascinating.

Much of my fascination with Greenleaf is that, for me, a white, big- city atheist, this world is so outside of my experience, in part because everyone's black, but more because everyone accepts Jesus as a very tangible figure in their lives. Only Grace is the sort of Christian I'm used to - the ""I'm more spiritual than religious"" type, and in her case she is torn between that and her evangelical roots.

Even though Jesus is so real for them, they are still human. One is clearly gay and trying hard not to be. The church head seems to be casually corrupt. Even Grace's odious pedophile uncle is probably a believer although he seems to flout everything in the bible.

There are some very interesting characters. Grace, her starchy mom and glad-handing dad, and most notably Kerrisa, played by Kim Hawthorne as a controlling, anxious woman resentful that following all the rules hasn't made her happy. She's awful, but also tragic.

I often object to character-driven dramas without much story, but in this case, I feel the story arc lays an element of artifice over these fascinating dynamics. Grace stays in town to play detective, looking for proof of her uncle's crimes, and while this story would be fine if it felt like just a part of the drama, its centrality overshadows the series' more subtle aspects.

I like Greenleaf, but I feel I would like it more if everyone just stayed at the dinner table forever."
Greenleaf,"All in all, I look forward to what's next.","I see great potential for an interesting look at the inside world of wealth. power and the cloak of holiness. David Keith is a master in delivering dialogue. I love Lynne Whitfield as the matriarch with some obvious issues, yet to be revealed I hope. As the series continues, I (dare I say it?) pray the writers become more confident and provide more realistic speaking styles. The decor of the home, church and offices are beautifully done.Kudos to production staff. I admire the modern styling of the characters. An accurate mix of traditional, natural, ethnic clothing and hairstyles. Multi-racial actors in all types of roles. In fact, the realistic relationship between Grace and her daughter is something I can identify with. Thanks for that. I'm excited that Ms. Winfrey supports this type of project."
Greenleaf,Enjoy it for what it is,"I love Greenleaf because it isnt too serious, the storylines are dramatic but not to dark. Its a nice break from reality, yes some bits may be abit unrealistic but I enjoy it and will continue to watch it!"
Greenleaf,So moved by it..,"I was so deeply moved by this show that it led me to write my first review on here. An addictive plot, amazing quality of acting and so many messages not only about religion but also about life itself.. The show has a way of pulling the audience inside of its world, making us feel like we are one of the Greenleafs. I am white; however I felt at home watching this show. No surprise Oprah takes part in this great production! With its bittersweet ending, I was devastated that it's over but also at peace within myself for some reasons I could not figure out. I am moved on a spiritual level as you can tell:) I am sure everyone who has belief inside of themselves regardless of what it is, will feel the same way. Plus I can not go without mentioning the amazing voice of Keith Davis, making his parts sound like a poem!"
Greenleaf,"So far, so good","I was prepared to be bored by this series but have been pleasantly surprised.The story lines of each of the characters are seemingly innocent but, become more complex with each episode.

Lynn Whitfield, as always, holds her own as the matriarch of this family whose members seem filled with discontent over the familial pecking order decided by their father. Oprah Winfrey is surprisingly okay as the family rebel aunt who wants to use her niece to bring down her shady brother.

It has, so far, delivered enough shock value to make it entertaining after 3 episodes."

Greenleaf,An interesting look at the behind the scenes of a megachurch family,Comentario no disponible
Greenleaf,Well worth watching,"Having watched all 5 seasons, I'd say this family-based drama is a solid 7. It paints a roller coaster of emotions within the turbulent world of the Greenleaf family and the megachurch they run. It does sometimes dive too deeply into soap opera style, and plot elements are sometimes resolved with a wave of a writer's wand, but then it is fictional drama, not reality. The church business is a novel setting, and, with the exception of several scenes in the final season, isn't too preachy. The characters are fairly well developed and their interaction credible. Even though the plot seems to point to the eldest daughter, Grace, as the main focal point, in my opinion the matriarch Lady Mae is the star of the show. She is strong yet sensitive, often witty and ultimately endearing. Great performance by Lynn Whitfield."
Greenleaf,Addictive,"Recently subscribed to Netflix and happened upon this production by accident just scrolling through the titles to find something interesting. And, this is January 2020. The first several episodes from season one were so good, I can't stop watching. The story lines remind me somewhat of the ""soaps"" we used to love to watch way back when,but the quality of the acting is excellent. Oprah would not put her name on junk. I'm white and feel at home watching this show and totally vested in the characters. I'm still only half-way through season 3 and dread having the show end. Surprise! Just announced filming will start for season 5."
Greenleaf,First 3 seasons very good,The last 2 seasons dragged on. Little soap opera quality. A lot of long dialogue. Lynn W is terrific! Love her!! It's worth the first 3.
Greenleaf,Couldn't get into this,Gave it 4 episodes and I couldn't enjoy it. The uncle thing was predictable a mile away
Greenleaf,Brilliant Concept Sabotaged By Clumsy Script,"The story of a Southern mega-church headed by a family of sly hypocrites. Living in luxury and wielding influence how deep does the spirituality they claim really run? Are their sins products of their own human frailty exacerbated by a difficult world? Or are they bad people pretending to be holy?

It is about time a TV series dealt with the world of organized, profit-motivated religious organizations. A night-time soap take on an African-American mega-church in the Deep South is a novel approach to that telling the stories of people that have not yet been properly told in a fictional construct.

But my praise ends there. A solid cast in an interesting setting largely goes wasted in teleplay scripts so inept that they look like film school dropouts wrote them.

I love night-time soaps. I like the idea for this show as well as the story and the characters and the angle they take in relating the narrative. It is an imagined glimpse into a secret world of powerful people who profess piety and modesty but can't live it and we get to see them at their best and worst. I want to see it get multiple seasons.

But the scripts have to get better. They need to be outlined better and the dialogue needs to be more subtle in relaying information as well as doing so in a natural manner in which real people speak. So far they have tried to cram too much information in each sentence"
Greenleaf,Great Dram,"Have just discovered this show on Netflix Australia and loving every minute of it. I love reading novels about family dramas, secrets and lies and so this was perfect for me.

To the cast and crew, keep up the great work."
Greenleaf,Behind-the-Scenes of a Church Family Who Doesn't Always Practice What It Preaches,"If you regularly attend church, you can receive spiritual healing, confess sins, and be in communion with God or at least perceive that this is happening. The clergy of the church facilitate your spiritual and religious needs and also acts as instructors, telling you, the congregants, what is right and wrong, sometimes claiming their advice is from Heaven. The clergy of the church, almost regardless of the denomination, is there to support the church members and potential converts. However, what about those people who play the role of the clergy? Who offers pastors, bishops and the like the spiritual guidance they may need? And what if the people performing those duties are in some ways compromising what they're telling others? Are they practicing what they're preaching?

""Greenleaf"", a relatively new television/cable series, focuses on a predominantly African-American Protestant Church called The Calvary Fellowship. The grand Pooh-Bah is Bishop James Greenleaf (Keith David), the most inspirational figure of the church during services particularly with his resonant but kindly voice. However, behind the scenes, the bishop has many personal problems and even hints of flaws in character. His wife and ""first lady"" of the church is Lady Mae Greenleaf (Lynn Whitfield) who is the unofficial matriarch. Although her husband runs the church, she runs the Greenleaf family so-to-speak. Most of the family are involved with church duties, helping out at services, conducting teaching programs (i.e. Sunday School) and even planning events. Because their church and congregation are very large, the family lives very well. Servants are constantly in attendance at the Greenleaf household. In other words, if you're a member of the Greenleaf family, you'll live in the upper middle-class, but the price you pay is you're going to be integral to the operations of the church. Else, you may have to get out of Dodge as did their wayward daughter, Grace.

The series begins when the Bishop's estranged daughter Grace Greenleaf decides to return to the family after 20 years of self-imposed exile. We learn that she had been a preacher for the church but decided to end her clerical life and live among secular culture. We also learn that James Greenleaf had designs for her daughter possibly to succeed him as the main voice of the church during services. She has returned to the family and to the church but at the beginning of the story she has no intention of standing at the pulpit and making grand religious-biblical pronouncements as she had 20 years earlier. Even before she's stepped back into their house, Lady Mae tells Grace ""not to cause trouble for their family"". Zing. We know this reunion of Grace with the Greenleaf family is going to cause trouble. Of course if there wasn't trouble, there wouldn't be a show!

At first Grace just agrees to answer phones at the church offices as the first voice heard by either church members or potential converts. When a grandmother enters her office asking that her granddaughter be baptized (without it seems permission of the mother or father), Grace decides to take the role she vowed she wouldn't play. She dons a white robe and performs the ceremony. This story may be about how Grace begins to rediscover and play the role she left 20 years earlier.

As the series unfolds, we learn there are many hypocrisies surrounding the Greenleaf family. Grace is not the only estranged family member. Mavis McCready (Oprah Winfrey) is an alcoholic lush and Lady Mae's estranged sister. She resides a ways away from the family, and they seem to disown her. Other skeletons lurk in the closet, some of whose bones begin to rattle. We learn about a child molestation case involving one of the parishoners which has been conveniently swept under the proverbial church carpets. Also, a senator is investigating churches and other faith-based entities who enjoy the privilege of not-for-profit status. The senator asks for their financial records, and after he has taken his leave, Bishop Greenleaf makes it clear he has no intention of revealing any church records. I am guessing this will have further implications in the future of the series.

A wonderful beginning to a masterful series. I think the main point of the story is that trying to juggle the problems of everyday life while maintaining a facade of ""purity"" may be too much for any family to accomplish. Consider the Bakkers of ""Praise the Lord"" who seemed wholesome until it was revealed they were engaging in fraudulent business practices. In the present series, we believe in the Greenleaf characters and their plights and their need to project an unstained veneer. The acting is outstanding, particularly David as the Bishop, Whitfield as the ""first lady"" and Dandridge as Grace. Honorable mention to Winfrey, playing against type as an alcoholic, the kind of character who might end up on Dr. Phil! While some of the situations might be perceived as melodramatic, other issues are dealt with, such as homosexuality, interracial sex, and even infidelity. For a family which is supposed to be holier than the congregation they serve, they seem to be digging some fairly large holes!"
Greenleaf,I Like This Show,"I'm glad that this drama is like a soap opera! I'm so tired of crime shows, murder mysteries, legal dramas. Comedies are so full of sexual inuendo they aren't funny any more. Gimme some liars, some nasty backstabbing and some good folks who cope. I like that not every character is a skinny model in too -small clothing. I like the scenes between siblings and that we have generations of them. I'd like to see more diversity but there's a statement being made that there are many fine African American actors .

When I like something, I like it. It's that simple. So have a nice day. Enjoy what you enjoy. Be happy; be kind; share love. What else can I say?"
Greenleaf,Great show!,"I was hesitant to watch this at first, but after starting the first episode I was hooked. There is such rich character development and the plot is strong, if not a little predictable at times.

That being said, a second season would ruin the impact of the first."
Greenleaf,Season 4 is just getting weird!,"This season 4 feels like only trouble trouble trouble, got me bored and not making any sense anymore! Sorry!!"
Greenleaf,Two thumbs up (Greenleaf),"I like the acting, I like the story, the directing, the lighting, the sound, the music, Two thumbs up..........

December 2019 26, Greenleaf, its ok."

Greenleaf,Amen,"Wow never realised the wealth involved in churches in USA that Bishops home is something else! I have watched last 2 seasons of this show and am halfway through the 3 red and I find the show very entertaining love the gospel music also all the characters are well developed now and the acting is top draw great to see Oprah and Pati la belle I am a big fan of both.

Glad to see it is scheduled for another season another show added to my favourites"
Greenleaf,Ok,Pretty good but some of the story lines were not that great
Greenleaf,"Bearable, no more","Entertaing up to a certain (low) level. The scenario constantly makes you wonder where the story is going. Basically the scenario is awfull and feels forced in an eagerness to bring focus to current societal issues. None of these issues however are dealt with in depth and are only superficially touched upon. Multiple storylines are simply cut of. A lot of completely pointless scenes and plotholes do not add to a coherent story. It's at times very hard to make any sense of this all and the reason is probably that there isn't one. The whole series feels like a cinematic supermarket that's low on stock and has a small variation of products. On the plus; I'm not a religious person, but I basically like how bible quotes are thrown into daily conversations, although at times I hear myself thinking ""Please God, no more.""

All in all you may compare this series to soaps like Dynasty, Dallas, The Bold and the Beautiful etc. A constant flow of fuss on your screen that is basically going nowhere and hardly makes any point.

If you can't find anything better, just check it out for yourself. Just don't expect a fantastic story filled with an interesting plot, great dialogues and scenes. It's mediocre at best. Two seasons was doable for me."
London Has Fallen,Major goof lol,Great action flick but with one major goof. When Banning and the Pres were at the mi6 hideout the agents there were told to leave and get to safety. The next scene showed the mi6 agents in the main mi6 headquarters briefing the chiefs. Why didn't Banning and the Pres go with them!!
London Has Fallen,"Don't listen to all the ""Movie Buffs""","Before listening to all of the 1 star reviews, hear me out. To start, if you think you're going to be watching a summer movie blockbuster that's 10/10 than you don't have a great judgement on films. Was the movie plot thin? Sure. Was the acting ""Oscar winning?"" Most certainly not. However, if you enjoy a decent action packed film from start to finish, you may just like this one a little bit. Gerard Butler plays his typical bad ass, ex-marine type character that helps to save the President of the United States. There's your plot. Simple and no more to it. That's what this film intended to give you. A simple plotted movie for action packed movie lovers. So, before you decide to toss this one out, go on Netflix on a boring Sunday afternoon and give it a try."
London Has Fallen,Awesome brainless fun,"1 star? Not as good as the first movie? Let's get real! Olympus Has Fallen was equally ridiculous, jingoistic, lacking well-rounded characters, and originality - so why is everyone surprised when London Has Fallen is no different?

Yes it's jingoistic. Yes it's still lacking well-rounded characters. Yes it's mindless violence. And yes it's ludicrous...

...ludicrously freaking awesome that is!

The first thing I loved about this movie was the bad language. It was refreshing. I know that sounds like an odd thing to say, but go with me a moment...

...see, in an era of 12A action movies with tonnes of violence and no bad language, Butler dropping the F bomb a billion times ironically brings a level of realism to London Has Fallen, that is lacking in movies that take themselves far more seriously.

Yes the entire concept is stupid, but that's not what we're here for. I'm here to watch Butler stab bad buys repeatedly in the chest and shoot AK-47s out of 4X4 cars bombing along the Thames at 80 miles per hour. That's what I signed up for.

The pacing of this movie is perfect. It's never boring, and the action sequences are really fun. Yes, in places the CG is a bit shoddy, but the movie is still quite spectacular in pulling off some big set pieces in London.

London Has Fallen is mainly a two-hander between Butler and Eckhart, with some nice buddy moments and fantastic action sequences throughout, including a mega shoot-out at Somerset House, a mega shoot-out in the Underground, and mega shoot outs in dark buildings, including the finale in Soho, of all places.

This isn't going to get any Oscars, but it's a brilliantly retro action movie that takes itself far less seriously than throw-back action films like Taken, which is no less crazy in the plot department.

Anyone who enjoys mindless action will not be disappointed, and where this movie lacks realistic plot, it makes up for it in pacing. At 1 hour 40 - in an age of bloated, long movies that think they're more intelligent than they are - this is frankly a breath of fresh air.

Get a big bowl of popcorn and some sodi-pops, and enjoy relentless, shooting, stabbing, swearing and explosions. Great fun!"
London Has Fallen,Suspend your disbelief - it's only a movie,"I enjoyed this film for what it is - yes, none of it's really that plausible, and yes, it's riddled with as many holes in the plot as there are bullet holes the President's Land Rover. Oh, and yes, it's one sided and terribly patriotic - if you're an American - but remember, it's only a film, and a Hollywood Tinsel Town film at that.

Significantly perhaps, as I watched The President face up to the plot against him, I kept wondering... ""what would Donald do in such circumstances?"" Let's hope he's not taking notes.

The naysayer membership here at IMDb who gave this film 1/10 are missing the point entirely. Like most of what is spewed out by Hollywood, it's all fiction and fantasy held together by as much implausibility as the producers can get away with, and I think most intelligent audiences will get that.

Ah, but ""what about the less intelligent movie goer?"" you might ask. Well, dress it up as much as you like and these people will never get the irony of such a picture. They've also probably made up their minds as to who's side they're on anyway - and no liberal, limp-wristed Hollywood alternative will convince them they're backing the wrong team.

So I encourage you to watch ""London Has Fallen"" if you get the chance, and if you can, enjoy your place in the Free World to make up your own mind..."

London Has Fallen,A good action movie,"""London Has Fallen"" delivered a middling cinematic experience that earned a 6/10 in my book. Its strength lay in the relentless action sequences and the palpable tension that kept me engaged throughout. However, the film's weakness became apparent in its somewhat generic and predictable plotline, lacking the depth and originality of its predecessor. The cinematography offered standard visuals without any standout moments, and while Gerard Butler's performance was commendable, the overall acting felt a bit one-dimensional. The music and visuals served their purpose but failed to leave a lasting impact. In the end, ""London Has Fallen"" provided an entertaining dose of action but failed to rise above the average, leaving me wishing for more substance and innovation in its storytelling."

London Has Fallen,Actually Enjoyed it,"Sorry to spoil the party but I actually enjoyed this movie.

OK it isn't Shakespeare or some deep meaning movie but it isn't meant to be. OK it has lots of plot holes and is pretty far fetched, as are most thrillers but I didn't watch it for any of those reasons.

This a good paced thriller and Mr Butler carries it of well. The action never stops from beginning to end and the acting no where near as bad as others on here have said.

I am only glad I didn't pay attention to all the negative comments on here as this is a movie I would watch again."
London Has Fallen,"Good Lord, this was bad...","I love a good, silly, dumb action movie. Truly, I do. But this one was just insulting... I felt like it was written by a bunch of 13 year old boys, cranked up on too much Red Bull.

Totally avoid of any characterisation other than in the broadest possible terms... the dialogue was just horrendous... the plot makes very little sense to anyone with the slightest scrap of brain in their head (what, most of the London police force were taken over by terrorists and NOBODY noticed?)and as for the SFX... you'd be embarrassed if you saw them in an X-box game! I'll admit, there was one good action sequence when Mr Butler and the SAS were advancing on the terrorists lair amidst a hail of gunfire, that was quite nicely done... but five minutes of decent enough action isn't enough to make me think that this film is anything other than an utter turkey...

Give it a swerve, IMO."
London Has Fallen,Just fine.,"London Has Fallen is directed by Babak Najafi and include the main cast of Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. I enjoyed the movie throughout, even though it started off really boring it definitely had some interesting parts here and there. The ending is also quite fun, in a turn-your-brain-off kind of way. What bothered me the most was the editing, which was terrible up until that one-shot sequence at the end, where it finally got a bit better. Gerard Butler is really great on the role, a total badass, even though he was so in a very unrealistic way. The overall character fits with the theme of the movie. Aaron Eckhart is also fine here, as he is in any movie ever. I think this actor is terribly underrated and overlooked no matter what role he is playing. The CGI is pretty underwhelming, they should have increased the budget from the first movie, which was also better in almost every aspect than this sequel. London Has Fallen is not made to be over analyzed, it is just a fun action meaningless, suspenseful and to a point unnecessary movie that's made for 90's action movie fans to enjoy."
London Has Fallen,A D grade movie that deserves to go straight to DVD and the bin after that.,"If like me, you liked the original, this will leave you greatly disappointed. No breakdown needed. Just mindless cheese through and through. Whilst the original shocked (in particular the opening scenes) with a grandiose, beyond belief terrorist attack, London has fallen shocks with its stupidity, predictability, poor CGI, complete neglect for any realism (not a even a tad!) and tediously boring action scenes that would be more fitting for a new van dame movie.

There's no need to break down this movie and pick it apart. Because the whole thing is just one big, boring mess of mindless BS.

How this movie got over 6.0 is beyond me ! It almost falls into the 'so bad, it's good category', but not quite, so it's just horribly bad and you won't be laughing either.

3.6 Material."
London Has Fallen,Clichéd But Still Entertains,Comentario no disponible
London Has Fallen,London has...delivered exactly what you came for,"The good: Solid action, good pacing and tongue-in-cheek but solid performances from the leads. The film clips along at a nice pace and does not overstay its welcome. There really aren't any unnecessary scenes, but some do fall into exposition heavy territory.

The bad: Mostly just some implausible action scenes fuelled by absolutely stupid decisions by the characters. Both antagonist and protagonists are guilty, and it really takes you out of the movie. This dumbness isn't necessary - Die Hard conquered it in the 80s. Intelligent heroes and villains do exist.

Should you watch it? If you're wanting a standard action flick that is fun, enjoyable and not too long. You've come to the right place."
London Has Fallen,"Incredibly stupid, typical American crap.","Possibly the dumbest movie ever, idiotic plot, American chest- beating, USA chanting nonsense.

There is absolutely nothing in this film remotely believable, and after the nonsense in the first one, you have to hope that this is the end of the franchise. What shocks me most is the appearance of Morgan Freeman in this movie. Is he so hard up that he needs to lower himself to this standard of film?

Do Americans understand anything that happens outside their country?

Save your time, save your money and avoid this crap. And please no more ""has fallen"" films. Let Butler retire."
London Has Fallen,"Reasonably fun, if you are in the right mood","As I have said before, I have a soft spot for movies made by Millennium Films, because they are the closest modern day equivalent to the notorious Cannon Films, which made a ton of cheesy but fun B grade movies in the 1980s. The Millennium Films production ""London Has Fallen"" is really a glorified Cannon movie, and that's why I had fun with it. Oh, I will admit that a lot of it is silly and/or bad. The CGI is often kind of cheap, the depiction of the story's terrorists and their intricate plans is really hard to swallow, and the movie is quite predictable. But it's enjoyable all the same. The first twenty five or so minutes are kind of slow, but then it starts delivering almost non stop action until the end. It's certainly never dull, and even a little exciting at times despite the fact you'll know how each scene will end as soon as it starts. I can see why some people would hate this movie, but for me, it was a fun romp. The more you like B movies, the better the chance you'll like this movie."
London Has Fallen,"If you liked Olympus Has Fallen, you'll like this better","So the trailer made me want to see this movie and I didn't see Olympus Has Fallen at that time. So I watched that yesterday and I liked it, fun action movie with some noticeable flaws.

Today I went to see London Has Fallen and I liked it better than the first one. The action scenes were a bit better than the first and more intense, the lighting and cinematography improved quite a bit compared to Olympus and the scale was bigger.

To get a little more in depth on certain matters that I liked: Gerard Butler is made for this role, he makes for a very likable action hero that gets the job done. He did that in Olympus and now in this one he did it a bit better I think.

The rest of the actors also do a good job, nothing really great but I got why everyone of them had a motivation to be there.

As I said the action was better than the first and with that I mean there is a good build up and when it starts I was invested in the scenes and wanted Gerard Butler to kick ass.

There are some issues with it though. In Olympus Has Fallen and the trailer for this movie I already saw that the CGI was really bad. Some explosions look really fake and it's weird that they didn't put more effort into making that look better.

Also this movie, like Olympus, is very patriotic. I think Americans will like the movie more than the rest of the world. I didn't mind it too much (I'm Dutch) but other people might find it somewhat annoying. What is a bit weird though is that they casted a Scot (Butler) to play an American. And the guy just doesn't have a good American accent which is just a bit weird.

Also some other technical elements like editing, sound etc. were quite poor during parts of the movie but I didn't mind it that much.

So all in all it's a dumb fun action movie and I'd recommend watching it, 7/10."
London Has Fallen,Good old fashioned Shoot em up - fun to watch (Guilty Pleasure),"Is the plot stupid and unbelievable? Yes

Is the acting predictably shallow? Yes

But was it fun to watch? You bet it was.

I'm sorry all the moral apologists want to tag this movie with some underlying meaning or propaganda message but this is not journalism or a dissertation... IT IS AN ACTION MOVIE! I came in with no filters expecting to see a good shoot em up movie and I got exactly what I expected. I knew the characters from the first one and didn't need the time wasted on re-establishing their characters. The movie was almost constant (even implausible) action in a haphazard script that requires you suspend common sense at times.

Were there stereotypes? Oh yeah.

Were there cliche's for dialogue? throughout

But the bottom line is that I was entertained enough to have watched it more than once and that is all I care about when I see this type of movie. Understand what it is and what it is not and if it draws your interest, I'll bet you like it like a guilty pleasure. So I give this film a thumbs up, despite of all those reviews before me that ripped it apart piece by piece while missing the whole point of seeing a movie like this."

London Has Fallen,London has fallen and your critical thinking might too,"Hello everybody,

I've just created my account on this website because of this one. I felt it was important for me to write a couple of lines about this movie.

Unfortunately, while the title may seem interesting, I can't say the same about the film. Indeed, it's not a real movie in the proper sense of the term, it's a propaganda campaign.

a patriot secret service agent, Gerard butler, saving the life of his beloved president while fighting the bad guys with a beard and some black skin they call terrorists.

Just take a look at it, it won't take long before you understand exactly what I mean. I never thought they would release something like that, but they did.

this should be studied at school as a tool used to brainwash people. but if you are a patriot and think that America is heaven, ready to give your life for your president, if you like closing your eyes while you're screwed by some politicians and if you think that everybody else who doesn't accept your opinion should die, then it might be the ""movie"" you 've been looking for."
London Has Fallen,"This movie is great for it's genre; tactical porn. If you think sneaky assassins are cool, this is the movie for you.","Really guys, it's not meant to be a probing exploration of post-colonial cultural identity and the failure of western statecraft to respect indigenous autonomy. I'm well aware of the fact that the chaos of the third world didn't fall out of the sky, and that The West in general and America specifically is culpable in creating the monsters it now has to face.

That's not what this movie is about. This movie is about really clever and well coordinated terrorists attacking London again and again and again.

Is it blatantly patriotic and biased? Yep. Is it realistic? No. Is it fun if you like that sort of thing? You bet it is, and America totally kicks ass in it too! You should watch Olympus has Fallen as well. Frankly I think it's the better of the two."
London Has Fallen,"Notably spectacular movie with thrills, intrigue , crossfire and plot twists.","This is a fast-paced, stylized spectacle film with lots of action , suspense and entertainment. Dealing with the typical plot in which our starring finds himself trapped into a complex plot while attempts to save US President . The movie begins with Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who is about to have a child with his pregnant wife Leah Banning (Radha Mitchell) . In London for the Prime Minister's funeral, Mike Banning is caught up in a plot to assassinate all the attending world leaders and to his President. But what begins as a state funeral for the British Prime Minister who died in strange circumstances becomes a deadly plot to destroy the most powerful leaders in the world, devastating the British capital and unleashing terror. Then the secret Service agent Mike Banning finds himself trapped into a twisted conspiracy in the wake of a terrorist attack and works to rescue the US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from his killers and avert an even bigger disaster . As Banning springs into action to save and protect the president from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders . With no choice but to fight back against the heavily-armed invaders, he must rely on his extensive knowledge of combat practice from previous service and to save and rescue the president, and prevent the situation from spiraling into all-out war. The world's leaders have assembled !. So have their enemies !. Prepare for bloody hell !. Loyalty Has Fallen Under Fire. Fallen. Forced to Fight for His Life. Loyalty is Under Fire . He protected the President. Now he must save himself. The Hero Becomes the Fugitive. What do you do when your government is out to get you?

Nail-biting thriller with action-packed , shootouts , excessive shaky cam in places and the special effects are brilliant enough . The best thing about this picture is its fast pace, there's not a minute you feel tired or dull. The attack sequences are bit over-the-top and overwhelming . The plot is plain and simple , as the US President is attempted to kill by a terrorist mastermind and Banning fights to save him and he's facing the biggest international crisis the world has ever experienced . The film is acceptable, but neither notable nor extraordinary , but decent enough, while direction by Babak Najafi is fitting as in all spectacle film that he makes. The interesting story based on characters created by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt and it is based on the novel by author Vince Flynn, ""Transfer of Power,"" that was basis for both of the movie plots used in ""White House Down"" and ""Olympus has fallen¨(2013) by Antoine Fuqua with Gerard Butler and its sequel ¨London has fallen¨by Babak Najafi . The thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement with lots of breathtaking action, as well as extensive scenes with full of F. X. of computer generator that are first-rate as well. The character Allan Trumbull : Morgan Freeman was the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the previous instalment and is the Vice-President in London has fallen and in Angel has Fallen results to be President . It's never explained/mentioned if he was either voted to succeed the deceased President on rules by the 25th amendment or ran on the election ticket for President Asher's second term, as it's mentioned he's six years into his presidency and won the election. Along with the main actors : Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, all of them giving nice acting . Along with the three protagonists of the installments of this exciting saga, completing the cast there's a number of notorious players appearing here and there , such as: Colin Salmon, Angela Bassett, Robert Foster, Jackie Earle Haley, Melissa Leo, Alon Aboutbou, Tim Woodward, Charlotte Riley, Sean O'Bryan, among others.

Cinematography by cameraman Ed Wild and musical score by Trevor Morris are perfectly suited to the fast-paced action that unfolds throughout. Settings are adequate , but shooting took place on sound stages and various filming locations,such as: New Boyana Film Studios, Sofía, Bulgaria, India, King William Walk, Greenwich, London, Greater London, England, but none of the first unit filming was done on White House location . The motion picture was competently directed by Babak Najafi (Sebbe, Banshee, Proud Mary, Snabba cash II).

The trilogy starred by Gerard Butler as Agent Banning is as follows : ¨Oympus has fallen¨ (2013) by Antoine Fuqua with Gerard Butler , Aaron Eckhart , Dylan McDermott , Rick Yune , Morgan Freeman , Angela Bassett , Melissa Leo. ¨London Has Fallen¨ (2016) director Antoine Fuqua refused to direct this sequel because he didn't like the scrip and replaced by director: Babak Najafi with Gerad Butler, Colin Salmon , Morgan Freeman , Robert Forster, Melissa Leo , Tim Woodward. And ¨Angel has fallen¨ (2019) by Ric Roman Waugh with Gerard Butler, Danny Huston, Tim Blake Nelson, Frederick Schmidt, Rocci-Boy Williams, Piper Perabo . Rating : 6/10 . Worthwhile watching . Essential and indispensable seeing for Gerard Butler, Aaaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman fans."
London Has Fallen,Almost Good. Not So Much Action.,"This is a sequel to the successful movie ""Olympus Has Fallen."" The story begins in London, where the British Prime Minister has passed away under mysterious circumstances. Leaders of the G7 attend his funeral.

Group of Seven (G7), international organization officially established in 1985 to facilitate economic cooperation among the world's largest industrial nations; summit meetings of the member nations began in 1975. Members are Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States.

However, what starts out as the most protected event on Earth turns into a deadly plot to kill the world's most powerful leaders, devastate every known landmark in the British capital, and unleash a terrifying vision of the future. Only three people have any hope of stopping it: the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart), his formidable Secret Service head (Gerard Butler), and an English MI-6 agent who rightly trusts no one.

5/10 . It need more action scenes and a stronger plot."

My biggest gripe is that 1month is completely inadequate for an experiment such as this. I suggest at least 6 months to truly get to the depths of how two people adjust to an arranged marriage. I understand that there are other concerns when producing a TV show, but one month can't be taken seriously. It almost smells lazy in terms of production.

The show recycled sound bites way too much. It was awful listening to the same quotes every episode!

The matching process was hardly described- really vague. It made the first episode quite boring- which worked for me because I watched the wedding one first, so I was already hooked. But what would be educational about this show is to learn more about how they matched these couples.

Another suggestion: it might be beneficial to round out every episode with a therapy session for each couple. It's another chance to educate the audience on healthy ways to confront marital issues, and it might help redirect couples early on, thereby increasing their chances of staying together."
Married at First Sight,They dragged this out WAY too much.,This got pretty boring and drawn out. Not worth all that time.
Married at First Sight,Suspicious of Producer,"First, Michael, ""making up a narrative,"" is LYING!!!

Secondly, and most importantly, having so many troubled persons or persons with diagnostic personality disorders makes me wonder if the producers are using innocent trusting people to have drama on the show."

Married at First Sight,Good Series But A Suggestion...,How about doing episodes for the over 50 singles trying to find love for a second time? I think you will be surprised hoe the audience could relate to a different age group. Just because we are older doesn't mean we are dead to happiness and desire! Call it....Married At First Site....Senior Edition!!
Married at First Sight,Marriage with the Perfect (?) Stranger,"This is a review for the second season of ""Married at First Sight"". There is another page for the first season.

""Married"" is a self-described social experiment, as are most reality shows. You put some people in an unusual situation and you see how they react.

In this case, a team of relationship experts collected tons of data on 7,000 candidates, then picked three men and three women who they determined to be suited for marriage--to each other. The six ""winners"" of this process then were told they would be getting married in ten days. To someone they would first meet at the altar. Pretty bold of the candidates, but they felt unsuccessful in their prior efforts to find ""the one"" and decided to let social science take its best shot.

The process requires the couples to marry, go on a one-week honeymoon, and make arrangements for cohabitation. At the end of six weeks, they are given the option of staying married or getting divorced.

The budding relationships are under stress, of course, but some start out better than others. But for all three couples, its a roller-coaster of emotions.

People sometimes make fun of ""The Bachelor"" because the participants expect to find a mate after just weeks of interaction. The fact that those weeks in no way resemble reality, because they are wined, dined and swept away to exotic destinations for once-in-a-lifetime dates, makes that show seem even more unrealistic. The differences with ""Married"" are that a) scientific matching is done up front and b) you don't get weeks to learn about someone before marrying. There is no proposal.

The series produces some touching moments and some that are tough to watch. There are surprises. See if you can figure out which couple will be the first to kiss. Or who will first say ""I love you."" Or who will consummate the marriage first."
Married at First Sight,Stop repeating why you are on this show!,"Oh my god, i give up on this show because every 15 seconds, one of the couples will tell the camera, I join Married at First sight because I want a husband. Yes yes we know that is the show, do we need you to repeat it like a hundred times per episode. I can't watch it anymore. This season is the worst. Everyone is fake being in love, fake this fake that just for the cameras. MAFS Australia is SO MUCH better. At least its not boring me to death."
Married at First Sight,"Finally Reality TV That is ""REAL""","I was pleasantly surprised with this show. As first I tuned in for just a couple of minutes to see what it was like. Next thing I knew I was glued for the whole hour. This show is very real and raw. From the lighting to the reactions of the ""contestants"". It makes you think, and you try to put yourself in their shoes to figure out what would you do. I am really looking forward to seeing how their new marriages unfold in the next 4 weeks. Starting a marriage with someone you know and love is hard enough, but starting a marriage with a total stranger, well that is insane! If I had to vote who is going to make it, I would have to pick Jaime and Doug. They seem the most grounded, and genuinely good people. I think that Cortney and the EMT are too ""all in"" and oblivious to reality. And Monet and Vaughn seem like they will have troubles as soon as both their closets are wide open. Looking forward to watching the rest of the mini-series!"
Married at First Sight,Under 28%That's Success?,"Ok we like the voyeuristic salaciousness.We both wonder what is an expert? Expert what? Based on the current success rate, ie. married and still together it is dumpster diving. Major league players with these stats would traded off or relegated to the minor leagues. The main concern is some of the mental abuse that is tolerated by the ""professionals."" There should be a safety button, get out of jail free card, or other device to immediately terminate a marriage. Based on this I wonder if the ""professionals "" are more concerned about their stats then their clients. I also wonder how the producers fit into the picture. Remember this is entertainment as well as someone life. Perhaps the methodology used to select candidates needs to be re-examined. The current couple Dork and Mindy are painful to watch. The man in the relationship has more excuses, obfuscations and outright BS than you know who. I trust they have signed NDA's and other documents which hold the ""professionals "" and the producers harmless. If not I would be at my attorney's office as fast as one could say mental cruelty."
Married at First Sight,Pointless and Somewhat Boring,"I started watching this after seeing a commercial for it and couldn't believe how ridiculous it sounded. It was like a train wreck I didn't want to see but was intrigued. Upon watching the first episode of the first season I thought maybe this could be interesting after all. But I soon realized it was anything but. I'd say I'd you're going to watch this then it may be worth watching the first season, but beyond that it's a waste of time.

Firstly, the success rate of this show is abysmal. Either the ""experts"" don't know what they're doing, or they're doing the best they can with the limited sample size, or both. I also feel like the show is really drawn out, which makes each subsequent episode more and more boring. But most importantly after 8 seasons and a 27% success rate means that this show has serious credibility issues. Clearly, whatever they are doing isn't working. If the success rate was higher, I'd actually be more open to the concept of this show. It's like the ""experts"" are determined to prove their ""skill"" instead of doing real science, which is to admit when something isn't working and revise the method."
Married at First Sight,"The Best Reality ""Love"" Show","To understand my perspective, I started watching this show on Season 9, which I saw on Netflix. I was recommended this show by a friend. I am a man, married to a woman - just mentioning that for context.

When I watched this for the first time, I didn't look into reviews or the success rates of the couples, I simply started watching. What caught my eye right off the bat was that for a reality TV show, this is the one that is taking the most risks, and that is what intrigued me the most. The concept is that you have 3 experts on relationships and intimacy, working with a pool of about 40 men and 40 women and trying to find the best matches. They settle on 4 couples and they give them 2 months to determine if they would like to stick it out or get a divorce.

The risks? The experts are with them the whole time, monitoring their marriage, offering advice, and guiding these new couples (many of them that have struggled in past relationships) to make it work. The put it on themselves to make it work. For the couples themselves, their placed in a very vulnerable position and are followed in all aspects of life from marriage to honeymoon to normal life. You see everything, basically, and it can get emotional. They have a stake in the game to make it work as well. If it fails, you'll probably know why.

The show does SO many things right, especially compared to other love shows that I've watched (The Bachelor/Bachelorette are the main ones that come to mind). Most other love shows I've seen take a couple through the honey moon and fantasy stages of a relationship, but everything ends there. You don't see anything else, and everything is shallow. I typically watch these kinds of shows because they make me think of how I'm treating my own wife, and, while these shallower shows do give me pause and make me think, it's nothing very deep. Entertaining, though? Yes - the cat fights in the Bachelor mansion are pretty enjoyable.

Then comes along ""Married at First Sight."" At least in Season 9, I could tell that each couple was fairly serious about wanting a marriage and relationship - especially the women. As I watched, yes, the first few episodes go through the honeymoon phase of their relationship, but the show is so much more about how they get through life after the fact.

They STRUGGLE and the show isn't afraid of showing it, and the contestants talk about it - awkwardly at times, but they DO talk about it. These people are shown in their most vulnerable and emotional moments and what catches my attention is the TOPICS they are discussing. They are struggling with feelings of abandonment, sense of pride, breaking down barriers, virginity, understanding another human being, and being a good partner. And the role of the experts throughout all of this? They offer counseling to the couples - REAL counseling - not the shallow counseling you'd see in a host like Chris Harrison. There are serious problems/fighting/anxiousness that the love experts get to the bottom of like it was a couple's therapy session. They are unapologetic in their approach, which I appreciate. I don't want the show to be rose-colored all the time. This is as real as I've ever seen it get.

I thoroughly enjoy it because it makes me think how I am treating my wife - am I someone that is showing her the love and attention she needs? How do I compare to the men on the show in how they are treating the wives they just met? I wouldn't enjoy it if I didn't feel I was learning something from it and gaining an internal perspective from it. No, this show is not the Bible for marriage - but it is entertaining, and it makes me think deeper than I normally would, which I really appreciate. The genuineness of everyone involved in the show keeps me watching.

Regarding the success rate of the show? I hear that it's not good. There are success stories, though. That's not why I'm watching, though. The effort these couples and experts are putting into this is genuine. This is very real, and that is what I appreciate. I'm not watching a fantasy."
Married at First Sight,Postmodern Horror Show,"Married at First Sight is a postmodern horror show; hosted by barely ethical quacks who go out of their way to prove some kind of vague hypothesis.

That being said, it is impossible look away as gullible, attractive Americans get what they signed up for: one month of forced domestic ""bliss.""

Watching this show is like watching NASCAR. You follow the cars as they circle a well-worn track, waiting and praying for a dramatic wreck - or a photo finish."
Married at First Sight,Officially out of love,This show has some promise but now they are letting toxic relationships steal the spotlight of people who may actually go on to find love. This Paige and Chris situation this season is a prime example of how this show is toxic now and it's he couples drama help ratings.
Married at First Sight,Success (non success) rate.,"I think this show needs to end. The so called experts have a worse success rate than people that get married without them! And the ones that did stay married, its only been a few years in and most couples that marry do stay together the first 5 years. It's time for these experts to see that this experiment is a HUGE failure and is wrong to continue. It seems they like to pair up couples that are very different in the hopes that their mate will change them. Big mistake! Lillian and Tom stayed married (so far), but I see them headed for a lot of problems in the future due to their so different work ethics. Season one none of the couples stayed married for even 6 months. That in itself should have been a big heads up for the producers and ""experts"" to see that their method is VERY flawed. Shame on them to keep doing new shows. Out of 12 couples only 3 are still happily married. Five years from now I think that won't even be true."
Married at First Sight,Decent Trash Entertainment,"When watching a dating reality show, it is important to realize that you should not be seeking an artistically edifying experience. The measure of the show comes in two aspects--first, is the premise interesting, and second, is the cast and the resulting drama compelling.

In the season that I watched (season 10) I would have to say the answer was basically yes to both questions. The premise is definitely interesting, if not a bit horrifying--10 singles are matched by dating experts into five couples and made to get married while never having met each other. They do a ceremony, honeymoon, and move into a neutral apartment for eight weeks, after which they get to decide whether they want to stay married.

Any sane person would see definite problems with this. Although matchmaking is an age old process, it is usually reserved for societies where the purpose is to join two families, not two individuals. The ceremony and honeymoon (in this case a week in a resort in Panama) become like an extended blind date, and the eight weeks a cohabitation period, with the real commitment declaration coming on ""Decision Day"" when the couples need to move out of their show-sponsored apartment. The whole thing is really a bit perverse.

Nonetheless, as an experiment, it is pretty interesting, and what we find is relatively predictable--the singles have widely divergent views of marriage that cause all sorts of trouble in the emerging relationships. Some of the cast, especially the men, have serious psychological issues that render them clearly unfit for marriage, such as Zach, who appears to have no empathy, Brandon, with serious anger management issues, and Michael, whose childhood traumas have left him incapable of telling the truth to his spouse.

All of these traumas lead to dramas, and I guess that is the point. The show claims that they fielded thousands of applicants for the season, you would think they would be able to find 10 people slightly better suited to try out marriage. Likely they threw in the wildcards for fun, and they definitely got the chaotic result they were hoping for. If you are into this sort of thing, and I do confess I consumed it as a guilty pleasure, then it is what it is and you will probably like it."
Married at First Sight,This show was so good!,"I enjoyed the people on the show. Also, I felt like it brings a lot to your own marriage seeing people go through stuff and the things that you go through in your marriage. It was very helpful."

Married at First Sight,"This isn't reality TV, it's filmed mental torture","You could argue that the participants know full well what they are getting into, so any humiliation they suffer is ""deserved"", and normally I'd agree. But this show goes to great length talking up the ""experts"" and their ability to be successful match makers, which I'm sure is sold to the contests in a very heavy-handed way, so I can understand why the contestants are getting an experience they didn't initially expect when signing up for this.

That being said, the ""experts"" are anything but. If as a licensed professional mental expert you think you can honestly evaluate two people's ability to coexist for life based on just a few hours of evaluation, you are a liar, a fraud, or just delusional. I've done the math, there's no way each hopeful participant (during the initial interviews) gets more than 15-30 minutes of 1:1 time, before the ""experts"" decide who should be with who. How can anyone possibly believe that's enough evaluation time?

If this show sold it to contestants that this was a roll of the dice, that it was pure luck to result in a successful marriage, that's kind of masochistic, but at least it's honest. No, instead these people are told that this match was a good match, it was ""scientific"" even.

That might sound harmless enough, but soon after the contestants independently realize they made a bad decision, the gaslighting by the ""experts"" begins. ""No honey, he's not secretly gay and using this as a publicity stunt to help his own career, he LOVES you!"" Marriages that are obvious train wrecks waiting to happen are forced to continue through endless gaslighting by the ""experts"" to keep up the ratings. It's pretty sick, especially since they all took an oath to ""do no harm.""

The terrible ""experts"" would be bad enough if that's the extent of the mental abuse the contestants suffer, but then let's add in that most of them are just terrible people, too.

If you've got a good job, and a decent body (as all the contestants always do), then if you're still single at 30 and willing to be on a reality show to ""find love"", there's a reason: Horrible mental baggage. Now, I'm not saying anyone who is single at 30 is a mental case, they are not. But THESE PEOPLE ARE. If you're willing to subject yourself to the humiliation that is marrying a stranger on reality tv? Yeah, there's issues there.

Why would anyone think marrying 2 people with huge baggage issues would ever result in success, is beyond me.

Final rant about this show: The ""experts"" continually refer to this show as ""an experiment."" Well after 10+ seasons, and only 5 marriages lasting more than 6 months out of 37+ couples, I can safely say the ""experiment"" is an utter failure."
Married at First Sight,a guilty pleasure,This has to be one of the funnest reality shows ever!! It is such a weird and crazy experiment and you really want the couples to stay together. I cannot believe that it has worked for some people. I will always love this show and it will always be a guilty pleasure of mine. I am a hopeless romantic and I love stories. My family and I will always adore this show and we will always enjoy watching it.
Married at First Sight,Lauren's views,Lauren's voice really grates she's constantly going on about something with her big mouth and her voice is so grating I have to cut her out .the rest of the show is really good .I always watch it.but please let's listen to the others instead of lauren constantly.why is she getting so much time with her comments .she doesn't really know what goes on the thr other couples and it's not really her business she really needs to concentrate on her own marriage she's not even happy with her husband for trying to keep the peace .please let other people have a say in future if she carry on I will be switching off till the next series.
Married at First Sight,"THE ""EXPERTS"" ON THIS SHOW SHOULD BE FIRED","I hate the experts so much....they shouldn't be involved. It's just a trauma fest and they are just hurting these people. These people are literal messes and they are preying on broken people for good tv. If they actually helped these people have good marriages, this could be a great show, but it's disgusting. The experts and therapists involved in this show show how broken our mental health system is- what a joke."

Married at First Sight,They need more time together,"I watched season 9 on Netflix which has the couple's together for 8 weeks. Now I'm watching season 1 on Amazon which says they only stay together for a month or so. I think the couple should stay together way longer to decide.

Season 9 had some shockers at the end and the end made me think that 8 weeks are enough but a month is not. I think maybe 3 months or so. Some reviews have said 6 months but if you really shouldn't be together that would be too long.

I think that the couple's should be more truthful to their partners and try to work it out more and put less emphasis on if you get a divorce."
Married at First Sight,"Really, really, really, really, really slow moving","It's slow moving. As in, a snail could move faster. My step daughter's turtle could crawl her tank 1000 times and this show would still be in the initial introduction phase. Then again, the demographic seems to be for those around 12 or 14 years-old so perhaps the redundancy and slow pace is warranted for this reason. Basically, it's always 3 couples. They're matched and in an excruciatingly predictable manner. One couple will be extremely traditional, the next will be one or both partners being either blooming idiots or narcissists (depends upon the given season) and the last is always an ethnic token. One or two couples will almost always ""work out,"" at least for a time and the failing couple is meant to be a surprise as they try to lead the viewer to believe they'll be the ones with the lasting commitment but is not the case. It's basically what would happen if someone went on a matchmaking dating site that claims to use ""expert opinion and technique"" and married on the 1st date. Frankly, it appears to be toying with one's life however, if one decides to make such a choice then by all means hopefully it works out for them. It would be wonderful if the producer would remove the redundancy because this ""series"" could reasonably be condensed into a series of 3 episodes: matchmaking, weddings (absent of repeating scenes, please) and the final breakup / wrap episode."

All Day and a Night,Disappointed,"I'm a Huge Ashton Sanders fan so I really wanted to like this movie but the writing just didn't do it for me. Great cinematography with beautiful colors and textures in the film but the script and storyline was very dry. I feel like this movie was a waste of the actors talents.

The movie had no soul... maybe the writers should do some more research on ""the hood"""

All Day and a Night,It is what it is... the city is the lead character,"Teachers of fiction sometimes talk about setting as a character in a story. That's exactly what we have here. Those who say it's boring or a ""typical hood movie"" don't know much about Oakland -- or similar environments -- from the inside out.

The movie argues that people don't have many real choices. Some IMDB reviewers say the characters lack the will to overcome hardships. It's some of both, but if you've done more than drive through the city, you'll know there's a constant grimness to what you see and hear, even on sunny days, even when the Warriors held their parades. People live shortchanged, mocked by the Bay Area's natural beauty, by the once-majestic houses that stand throughout the town, even in ""the hood.""

People on both sides of the law are hard. Simply turning a corner onto a street where other drivers have chosen to stop and talk (and eff your hurry to get somewhere) can lead to violent conflict. Going into a 7-11, an auto parts store, whatever, can mean navigating strangers who put you on the spot with ""fighting words.""

The motor homes and tents of the homeless are everywhere. If you ask why the cops don't move them along, the answer is ""they've got way too much else more important to do.""

When you wake up every morning in that environment -- with routine everyday decisions carrying the potential to turn meaningful -- life becomes constant edgy irritation. The characters in ""All Day..."" face interactions with place as much as with the other characters. Like another recent movie set in the town, ""Blindspotting,"" this movie captures the grind. And yeah, perhaps at the expense of more violence than needed and a slowish plot, but it tells the story in set out to tell."

All Day and a Night,Ashton Sanders impresses the most,"I had a good time watching 'All Day and a Night'. You can see it's well made, has a strong cast and features an engaging story. It isn't perfect of course, but it's a more than decent film.

Ashton Sanders impresses the most in my opinion, he plays Jah excellently - I could appreciate what they were telling about his role, which is thanks to Sanders as much as it is to Joe Robert Cole & Co. Jeffrey Wright, who I like a lot as an actor, is up to scratch as J.D., even if his character comes across, at least to me, a little stereotypical at moments.

It's a story very nicely told, I like how it portrays it mostly via flashbacks. I guess you could argue a few parts are overly entwined, but overall I think they did a very solid job. Well worth a watch."
All Day and a Night,What was the point?,"I watched the entire film and came away with nothing. What was the point? It's a stereotypical hood drama with an unoriginal plot and explicit violence. It's culturally regressive. I can't help but wonder why someone would finance this film. So cringey and played out. Jeffrey Wright, as usual, stands out and gives you a glimpse of his immense range an actor. Ashton Sanders pretty much plays the same character he played in the wu-tang series on Hulu. He's not good but not bad either. Overall Re-watch value: 0"
All Day and a Night,Powerful Performances Undermined by a Familiar Narrative,"""All Day and a Night"" is an unflinching portrait of cycles of violence and systemic problems that plague urban communities, with the calling card of a very strong central performance from Ashton Sanders. Gritty realism and heartfelt exploration of a single man in his quest to fight through the baggage that fate would have him carry make both poignant and thought-provoking moments. However, this often straddled narrative device between past and present makes it feel disjointed, which bodes well neither for the flow nor the emotional impact. Though well-acted, the supporting characters feel underdeveloped, and some of the story arcs feel underbaked. ""All Day and a Night"" is still an emotionally moving drama and covers urgent social issues, even if its execution is far from perfect."
All Day and a Night,TWO HOURS ALL FOR WHAT??,"Honestly I gotta ask what the point of this movie was, cause I got to the end still trying to figure if the motive was worth the time I sat to watch the movie. It just shows the life in the hood and the things that come with it, but nah aiint nothing special."
All Day and a Night,"Powerful, yet misunderstood film (based on reviews)","Extremely powerful picture. What some may view as your stereotypical black film goes beyond that. The film is nuanced in such a way that those who can't begin to understand the life of a large number of minorities in America, and what they go through, may not appreciate. The film is not meant to be a gangster film, but a film that depicts multigenerational struggles, complex father-son relationships and the fight to break the cycle bred by systemic poverty and the pipeline to prison. A film that simply isn't meant for the ignorant minds of those who wish to stay ignorant, but those who understand the challenges in America.

Jeffrey Wright, per usual, is excellent in his character development and Ashton Sanders continues to flourish and grow as actor."
All Day and a Night,"Wanted to love it, but it's too slow","Story starts out strong and intriguing, but ends up moving too slow. It'a sad to see how poverty affects kids lives and I like how it hops around from past to present, but the main character is pretty boring. I like his character as a kid and watching him process and deal with the messes that come his way, but him as an adult is nothing special. His best scene was in the bath with his girl cuz we got to see him actually show feelings, other than that he's stone cold. I hardly empathized with him even though I wanted to. Overall good story, but could have been a much better movie."

All Day and a Night,Understanding,"Actions have to make sense right? Now if someone you know was to be hurt by another person (I'm putting it mildly and it also happens right at the start of the movie), you'd be excused for wanting - actually make that needing answers to why. To have an understanding. It doesn't mean the pain would go away, but it might ease your mind a bit ... then again who is to say it would? It depends on the answer you'd be getting and your state of mind.

Now the movie deals with what happened to and what made our pulprit the way he ended up being .. it is not poetic justice, some may not even feel like it is any sort of justice ... it seems inevitable, no matter how good the intentions of those involved are or were. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger? There are merits to that, there are also merits to tough love ... but there also downfalls to both those ... it all depends on the individual and how it will be perceived and received ... and taken into (account). A drama that might rub you the wrong way, with timeline jumps that warrant your full attention. There is a reason why they compare this to Moonlight and highlight the fact that there are people involved from that movie ... this probably would be a good double bill"
All Day and a Night,Pretty Good,Pretty good movie; glad to see Ashton and others. Instead of the same faces.
All Day and a Night,"Generic "" hood "" movie .. Nothing to write home about.","The acting didn't completely suck, but I just couldn't get past the terrible accents and unoriginal plot. This movie is supposed to take place in Oakland California, but the main characters sound nothing close. It really feels culturally regressive Overall. Hood drama done very predictably, reminds me why I prefer documentaries over underwhelming story telling."

All Day and a Night,My 1st Review Here!,Comentario no disponible
All Day and a Night,Beautifully Done,"Ashton Sanders is mysterious, brooding and complex, similar to his role in Moonlight.

Very disappointing to see reviewers reduce this beautifully done film down to a ""hood movie"".

If you simply appreciate good art, you'll savor every minute. Not for the squeamish. Not for those who do not like thinking while watching movies. Not for those who embrace prejudices."
All Day and a Night,Possible story but it's a secret??,"Looked like good cinematography, acting appeared fine. Sound mix is absolutely horrible. If there is a story be prepared to get much less than have if it delivered to you. Low whispers, music pumped in places. Looks like whatever this is trying to expose will remain hidden until the sound techs bring the important messages to the front!"
All Day and a Night,Break The Cycle,"Product of my Own Environment POME

Decent flick about a broken family. Cycle repeats to the next Gen. Stereotypes & Bad Decisions all up in here. Seen this formula b4.

Jeffrey Wright had some strong scenes. But Yakya Abdul Mateen was the my main man here. Cannot wait to see him get larger lead roles. Ashton was nice."
All Day and a Night,😒,So confusing it sad! Replayed a few scenes just still confused me
All Day and a Night,Good story with good performance,"I really don't understand who doesn't like this movie. Most of them waiting for happy ending. Sorry guys, I have a bad news for you, art of cinema is not a stupid fairy tales, it's a mirror of real life. And yes, there are lives like these characters."
The Dragon Prince,Excellent!,If You are a fan of the avatar series the dragon Prince is a perfect spiritual successor to watch on netflix.
The Dragon Prince,Fun for the whole family,"My whole family (kids ages 12, 9 & 7 & 2 adults) really enjoys watching this show together! The characters are well done. The dialogue is witty and funny. The story is very compelling! We hope more seasons come out Very Soon! The kids tell me to add that the little creature named Bait is the best!"
The Dragon Prince,This show is a must see!,"This show is like the sphinx, or like the leaning tower of Pisa. 99% perfect. The flaws add to the perfection. There are no bad guys. Rayla, Ezran, and Callum, may be the protagonists, but Viren, Claudia and Soren are hardly despicable bad guys. In fact, they have qualities we can agree with. There are no bad guys. Just politically juxtaposed ideals and steadfastness in their stances. This show is basically just as good, maybe better than Game of Thrones. It's a family friendly version. These characters are magnetic, substantial. Every character has redeeming qualities we can relate to. 100% certified fresh? I fully agree. This show is a must watch for everyone"
The Dragon Prince,A show for everyone of all ages,"Despite technically being considered an adult, I still Rewatch avatar: the last airbender and the legend of korra pretty regularly. Those shows, as well as the Dragon Prince I believe are very important as they allow children to watch a tv show that has just as much heart and love put into it as any adult television. Shows like these allow children, as well as others to watch a show that doesn't dumb down its subject matter or lore. Shows like these give kids the oputunity to watch non serialized tales that teach life lessons. I've watched the first few episodes and it shows nuances unlike anything seen in children's television. It is perfect for adults who are sick of watching spongebob squarepants with their children. It is very entertaining as well as well-written and facinating. It is perfect for anyone at any age and would highly recommend."
The Dragon Prince,Fantastic,This show is absolutely fantastic if you're a fan of Avatar the last Airbender or even just a fan of fantasy this is the perfect show for you the story is in depth the characters are great and it's all so well paced you'll be wanted more after every season watched. Highly recommended!!
The Dragon Prince,Epic! Awesome!,"Our family began watching this for the kids but then the parents are watching without the kids! We all love it. Very well written script. Simple, real characters. Neat twists. I'm invested in these guys, I wanna see how it goes for them! That's what a good show is made of. Add a Scottish accent and I'm hooked! Check it out!!"
The Dragon Prince,One of the Best Fantasies of this Generation,"At the time of writing, Wonderstorm has just released season 3. So far, this show is one of the most captivating and inspiring stories that I have seen in my generation, animated or not. The animation style originally proved to be a hurdle, but the second season smoothed it out. After every season release I have been in awe at the masterful writing this show displays in it's enthralling plot line, authentic character development, and beautiful moral driving everything. Most notably is the constant ethical balance the characters keep in their stance on how the world should change. I have never seen a show that so vividly protrays important moral concepts like self justification, stereotyping, and ambiguity while keeping the wholesome and light hearted nature of the writing style. This is a story that deserves to be told, and personally brings back feelings of the first time I read Tolken's 'The Lord of the Rings'."
The Dragon Prince,Interesting story and great characters,I was hoping this would be a good show and I am happy to say that it is. It has an interesting story and great characters. Most complaints I read here were about the animation which didn't bother me. The animation gets smoother in season 2 and I'm also happy that the story didn't lose its momentum in season 2 but actually gets even more interesting . I highly recommend this series.
The Dragon Prince,Season 2 Review,"This is specifically a review for Season 2, and not Season 1. If you are new to this show, I would recommend reading Season 1 reviews as they may be more useful to you.

While I won't go into any specific details to avoid spoilers, I will simply say that Season 2 is fantastic, and a real pleasure to experience. If you enjoyed Season 1, or even thought Season 1 was ""pretty good but nothing special"", you have to see Season 2. It is truly amazing. Everything was just incredible, the art, the backgrounds, the music, the fight scenes were INCREDIBLY good and high quality, the story was amazingly well rounded with tons of development, backstory, and mysteries still left to unveil.

But most importantly, the true beauty of the show really shined again this Season, and that was the characters. The dialogue is just superb. I particularly love Soren's character, and just how much life he breathes into every scene he's in. All the new characters are fantastic, and one of them in particular has a voice of GOLD (you'll know what I mean when you watch the season). I wouldn't go through every character that were great because truly they all were, but Callum, Rayla, Ezren, Claudia and Soren had some fantastic scenes in this season.

The animation has gotten so much better, it is very smooth and flows very very well. While I never had a problem with Season 1's animation, if that ever bugged you, this newer Season has completely removed all of the stuttering and frame problems.

Now what are you still doing here? GO WATCH SEASON 2 ALREADY"
The Dragon Prince,Season 4 review,"Took 2+- Years and its only ground for the new seasons, i understand this is important but man why the whole season!

And its not just that, i cant feel the same way with the characters because they act out of character. This season was so desperate to have a actionful last episodes they messed up.

I still believe in the series, but dont go into with too much expectations.

Season 5 hopefully will be on at july 2023, i hope they make a banger last 3 seasons because they sacraficed a whole season and 2 years for this.

For the previous 3 seasons my review is 8.3 average.

Even tho this season is murdered you should check this one out!"
The Dragon Prince,Great Show,"While I miss the Last Airbender/Legend of Korra franchise, this is a really good show for all ages. The characters are very well created, the story develops pretty well, the humor can be pretty funny, and all in all a great adventure. The new animation style is pretty cool, and there were some times that I did see the old style of the writer's work in the characters expressions and dialogue."
The Dragon Prince,"First 3 seasons great. After that, not worth watching","Tl;dr 8/10 for the first 3 seasons. After that the show nosedives.

Full review.

""The Dragon Prince"" started with great promise in its initial three seasons. These early episodes showcased a rich, engaging world filled with intriguing characters and a compelling plot. The animation style was unique, blending traditional 2D character design with 3D environments, creating a visually stunning experience. The story, centered around two human princes and an elf assassin, was both engaging and emotionally resonant, dealing with themes of war, peace, and understanding. There was humor and flashes of great writing.

However, the show's quality took a noticeable downturn starting from Season 4. The writing, once sharp and nuanced, became increasingly lackluster. Plotlines that were carefully built in the first three seasons seemed to unravel, losing the depth and complexity that initially made the show appealing. Characters, once richly developed, started to feel one-dimensional, and their decisions and growth no longer felt organic.

Season 5 continued this disappointing trend. The narrative, which had been tightly woven in the earlier seasons, felt disjointed and rushed. Key story arcs were resolved in unsatisfying ways, and new plotlines introduced felt superficial and unengaging. It seemed as if the show had lost sight of what made it special in the first place.

In summary, while the first three seasons of ""The Dragon Prince"" are definitely worth watching for their storytelling, character development, and unique animation style, the subsequent seasons fail to live up to the high standards set by their predecessors. Seasons 4 and 5 suffer from poor writing and storytelling, making them less enjoyable and, unfortunately, not worth the time for fans who cherished the show's initial excellence."
The Dragon Prince,"Big oof on season 4, still love 1-3",Comentario no disponible
The Dragon Prince,A Gem of Its Own,"I honestly didn't know it was created by the makers of Last Airbender until I finished the first season (though I recognized Sokka's voice actor and the book one intro should've been a clue) and I don't care to compare it to AtLA. Its an amazing show on its own! Diverse characters, character development, intrigue, humor, heart warming moments, and 8 even teared up. Is it perfect? No but it doesn't have to be. This is my new favorite show, as I'm sure it is for a lot of people. Really excited to see season 2!"
The Dragon Prince,Loved this series,"I absolutely loved this series. Wish it was longer but a lot developed in the 9 episodes. I would've given a 10 but the animation is a bit off. It seems like a really cheap and lazy form of animation. It felt like i was watching a bunch of stills from a book with no movement. Not a fan of outlining everything. Despite this which is just a personal preference i loved the show. Good character development and great story. Very similiar to Avatar the last airbender, which is still one of the best cartoons ever. Callum reminds me a lot like Sokka. Overall worth watching cant wait for season 2."
The Dragon Prince,Worth the binge,"I was skeptical when I saw this announced and heard it was from Avatar creators. While The Last Airbender was a good show, I didn't want to see that recreated with dragons slapped on the label. While the show initially irked me by following the same ""Book/Chapter"" format to the seasons and titles along with having elemental sources of power, I was happily refreshed by how original everything else was. While there are design elements I don't necessarily like, all of the characters so far are so unique and unexpected. Who thinks to animate a mute warrior and have them use sign language in a cartoon? And it really works. Overall I really like the story and want to see more. And I, for one, enjoy the animation style. It draws me back to Dragon Booster and I love it."
The Dragon Prince,"10 starts for Dragon Prince Season1-3, Season 4 what happened?","The firstthree seasons of this series have it all, adventure, humor, pathos. There is something about the characters as drawn and voiced that really works. I love that the show is diversity friendly. I enjoyed the critique of human greed and constant need for a kind of techno power. I felt the plot line was enjoyable and restorative. I re-watched the series more than once. Was and am an eager fan.

It seems that something that was natural and easy, became over thought in season 4. I found season 4 very hard to watch. Something that was really working in season 1-3, was turned off in season 4(mystery of avvaros) took over the name of the series in which many renditions. Season five through seven seems back on track. Maybe I just accepted the changes that season four brought. I found the story of Lord Veron and Claudia, very compelling and unique. The shows creative twists, and turns were very compelling."
The Dragon Prince,Very worth watching,"I did se season one in one go. And it did not feel long. Good characters, good story, beautiful artwork. Yes, I did see the Last Airbinder/Korra references. Yes, it was made for young people. But for one who graded up to level 60, I do relax and enjoy this kind of TV shows of this quality. A light in a dark world. Yes I do dream of dragons, ever since Anne McCaffrey Dragon riders of Pern. Well done, you lot."
The Dragon Prince,A Fantastic Series,"The Dragon Prince is awesome. It has a highly entertaining story, clever humor, interesting characters, and tons of beautiful art. It also takes cues from some of the best elements in Avatar: the Last Airbender, and manages to make them feel fresh and uniquely its own (e.g. different types of magic compared to different types of bending).

The animation looks great as well. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical of the 3D art style at first, but after the first episode, I was already used to it and ended up really liking it!

The lore and setting of The Dragon Prince has much to offer as well. Featuring a medieval setting with magic, knights, assassins, and, of course, dragons! There's so much to enjoy in The Dragon Prince. If you're looking for an engaging show with great lore and great characters (as well as a similar feel and good writing like Avatar: the Last Airbender) then The Dragon Prince is for you."
The Dragon Prince,Fair Warning. Watch only S1-3 avoid 4.,"So my rating is 6 because S1-S3 were 8. Total of 24 divided by 4 cause season 4 is 0 point. I stopped at 2nd episode cause

1. It's already loaded with agenda. And its an animation where it was supposed to be for kids. The rating is 18+ now. And everyone gets an elf boyfriend/girlfriend. They were sworn enemies for ages!!

2. The characters are all dumbed down. For example soren was stupid but quite funny now he's just annoyingly stupid.

3. Lots of unnecesary dialogue. Like ""i love books!!"" ""Yes books are awesome!."" Wtf?

4. And they change the animation style, it was from like you know avatar of Aang style, now it's more like 3dimension which in my opinion it made it worse."
The Dragon Prince,Great show! Cant wait to see more episode!,I didnt really know what the show was but I started watching it and got hooked on it. It definitely got me emotionally attached to each character and they all have a crucial part In the show. The show is very funny its clever and keeps you on your toes. I always want to know what will happen next.
The Dragon Prince,"The 4th season, disappointing",Comentario no disponible
The Dragon Prince,Pretty good but they skimped on the animation,"It's fun. Good story, world building and characters. I like the music, the humor is decent and the voice acting is good as well.

While the animation looks ok as far as the art style goes (it's kinda cell shaded and lacks fine details but has a nice color pallet and basic conept) the frame rate is abysmally low. It's really obvious and its jarring. The action is decent but at these frame rates fast/quick motion in in the action scenes is clunky and jarring. Even in normal conversation the characters look robotic. They can hardly get the mouths to match the voices properly because the frame rate is so bad. It all just looks off.

Its a real shame to because there is definitely something here, but it's hard to watch because they didnt throw enough money into animating enough frames to do it justice"
The Dragon Prince,S1-3 were great! But 4 s**t the bed. But we're we surprised?,Comentario no disponible
The Dragon Prince,EXCELLENT SHOW!,The show keeps getting better and better every year. It feels like a PG-13 version of George RR Martin's Game of Thrones saga but with more DRAGONS.
The Lovebirds,Funny at Times,"This film is very hit or miss. At times it can be really funny. For example one of the first scenes of the leads as a couple in their apartment is great. I think it really gets how couples are and how they argue about trivial things and they make it really funny.

But the film can get bogged down by the jokes that don't land and can kinda make you cringe slightly.

Issa Rea is great and probably my favourite part of the movie. Most of her lines land and don't get me wrong Kumail is really good to but some of his line do fall flat.

The plot is also kinda predictable and basic but it doesn't make it any less enjoyable.

I also noticed that Netflix basically did zero promotion for this movie which I found strange but Iv have kind of come to expect that from Netflix.

So it's an easy watch and you'll get a few laughs I'd say give it a watch"
The Lovebirds,"Not Exactly Original, but still Fun","Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani make for an instantly believable couple. The first moments of ""The Lovebirds"" establish that these two have obvious chemistry, they seem like a real couple (maybe even one that you know), and most importantly, they're undeniably likable. The entire success of the movie hinges upon the actors' ability to be charming and witty and enjoyable as a duo. If they do not play off each other in a fun and funny way, no viewer is going to want to hang out with them for 90 minutes.

Fortunately, these two have chemistry in spades. It's their genuine connection and Michael Showalter's directing flair that keep the movie tumbling along in a semi-coherent direction despite a plot with holes large enough to fit a small yacht.

In the ilk of fellow couples comedies like ""Date Night"" and ""Game Night,"" ""The Lovebirds"" takes place over the course of a single day - at least, aside from the opening scene depicting the couple fully engulfed in the early honeymoon stage of their relationship. Jump ahead four years and we see the two of them suddenly arguing about the most frivolous of hypotheticals. The one we witness happens to be about how well they would fare as contestants on The Amazing Race. It's a funny and seemingly ridiculous conversation since they certainly will not ever find themselves involved in such circumstances. But then they witness a murder, flee the scene, evade the police, and believe that they need to investigate the situation themselves to prove their innocence. From there, they are forced to follow a set of enigmatic clues leading them in a desperate dash from one destination to the next. It's their very own amazing race to avoid prison.

Each scene rolls rapidly into the next and the banter crackles with just as much energy. The filmmakers hope the pacing and humor will provide enough joy that viewers will not stop laughing long enough to scrutinize the feasibility of the story. It mostly works out fine, thanks to the co-stars.

By the time the ride rolls to halt, there are enough unanswered questions and jokes left untold for a sequel. If the opportunity for a second round should ultimately arise, most would happily accept. Count me in for ""The Lovebirds 2."""
The Lovebirds,Much funnier than I expected,"I thought the trailer was kind of bad so I was pleasantly surprised by how funny the movie was. Gotta give credit to Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae. I was a fan of Kumail from Silicon Valley and The Big Sick, but I had yet to see anything Issa Rae is in. Now I really want to watch Insecure. The film is also self aware, it's only around 90 minutes so it doesn't waste any time. Overall, solid comedy but I'm glad I watched it on Netflix rather than in a theater."
The Lovebirds,Funny enough for me to keep me entertained.,"When I saw Kumail Nanjianis name in the cast I knew I would have a good time watching this comedy. I don't know if I can see him in anything else than a comedy and that's fine. He just has that kind of funny face. Stuber was the last movie I enjoyed from him and now it will be The Lovebirds. Don't expect anything too serious though, it's just a mild rom-com with a little crime investigation to spice it up, but there are enough funny moments to keep you entertained. The two main characters are played by Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani, and it works good. The Lovebirds isn't great cinema, but it doesn't pretend to be, it's just a good moment of easy comedy, a genre that we all need at some point."
The Lovebirds,Rom-com version of a Buddy Cop movie,"It's a fun, easy watch with a couple good laughs sprinkled in. It's one of those movies we've all seen dozens of times, and there's a certain mindless comfort that comes with movies like this.

As long as you aren't looking for anything groundbreaking, and don't take it too seriously, this is an enjoyable popcorn movie."
The Lovebirds,Super Cute and Funny,"You're probably gonna say to yourself ""real people do not act like this."" And you're most definitely right. However, if you can get past that, Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani make this movie hilarious with their own unique styles of comedy. Their performances shine bright next to a pretty lackluster plot and dialogue. If you're a fan of either of their work, like me, you will most likely have fun. The movie is enjoyable, and it is great to see two actors of color take the lead in a rom-Com/mystery!"
The Lovebirds,have a look at this,"Because this is a good mixture of genre interception, with a whole lot of the new verbal comedy, with a good stroke of blimping good old fashion coincidental kick and run fun, mixed with some coldblooded murders that send shivers through the unlucky couple, and where the black comedy are almost not excisting.

this film made me smile and even laugh occationally, and the charms that irradiates from the main actors in their adrenalittic fight or flee night in the city are great. most of all i liked the appearences of Kumail Nanjiani , whos bollywood smile and glitchy sparkling eyes really turns into a good prankingly well made comedy.

as a tech product its on the baseline of nescessety, the story may feel cheesy and cliche for the squemish, but the music chimes in well, and the playtime are just perfect. it has a well balanced line of plot between the comedy and the crimedrama. i can just say i started this viewing with low expectations, that felt like winning the lottery halfway through. so the grumpy old man gives a thumb up for this one."
The Lovebirds,Ultimately just boring,"I was hopeful, going in to The Lovebirds, because I'd read reviews praising the chemistry and likeability of the leads. That they are likeable is true enough, and there are a couple of jokes in there somewhere too but the plot is weak and, for a short feature film, it dragged like hell. I thought it was about 25 minutes longer than it was. The best bits are when they couple are just talking about their problems. They could have made a modern Before Sunrise, but instead they made a bellow average murder mystery. Shame."
The Lovebirds,some potential for comedic duo,"Leilani (Issa Rae) and Jibran (Kumail Nanjiani) are new lovebirds in New Orleans. Four years later, they're fighting about everything from marriage to The Amazing Race. They agree to break up when suddenly Jibran drives over a bicyclist. It's the start of a ridiculous murder mystery while they go on the run from the cops.

First, I wouldn't do what they did. It's just stupid to run away like that. I would just wait for the cops and demand for a lawyer. At least, drive away in your own car. Obviously, the cops will track the car back to you. I guess Lyft is a little funny but it's no excuse to do something that stupid. Then I wonder if it's less awkward to not breakup before the incident. I understand the idea of them falling back in love but the breakup makes the relationship too angry. The two actors have enough bite that they don't need the anger to spice things up. I like the actors and I want to like these character more than I actually do. Another needed change is a traffic camera picture for the interrogation room. The twist is obvious but the picture is the missing piece in setting it up. This comedic duo holds some good potential but they need more loving chemistry to solidify a good coupling."
The Lovebirds,I can't believe they were going to release this in theatres,The best way to describe this would be two talented actors were give a plot that sounded good in theory but was utterly destroyed by a terrible script and veeeery poor editing.
The Lovebirds,Date Night part two. Funny n entertaining with lovely performances by Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani.,"An argumentative couple on the brink of ending their relationship, hits a cyclist with their car who doesn't get injured. Later they r approached by a cop who uses their car to pursue the same cyclist n rather than arresting the cyclist, the cop kills him with the couple's car. The couple flee the scene aft witnessing the murder. The husband wants them to turn themselves in, but the wife argues that their unbelievable story and racial profiling will ensure they are blamed for the crime. They try to pursue the matter n solve the mystery to clear their names. Well this may seem very similar to Date Night but this film has enuff funny moments, good pacing n lovely chemistry n acting. Coincidentally this is the second Kumail Nanjiani film aft Stuber I saw within a short period n both r very funny n light films to check out during this lockdown."
The Lovebirds,Entertaining,"A film perfectly combines adventure and comedy. It is about a couple that is unintentionally incriminated in a murder and seeks to solve it without verse as murderers. It has few action scenes. It portrays the life of a couple in a masterful way in its beginnings and in the twilight of a relationship. The comedy moments are enjoyable, although there are some goofy moments, there are some parts of the dialogue risque. Entertaining Quality. Kumail Nanjiani has been making these kinds of characters lately and they look pretty good on him. There is a lot of chemistry between the protagonists."
The Lovebirds,"has its moments, but...",The endless chatter between the leads is too much its like they had 40 minutes spare time in the script in order to make it a full movie so they just went on with unnecessary and forced dialogue
The Lovebirds,"Perilous, ridiculous & hilarious","This was a lot of fun. It's obviously got a timely message in it's storyline about racism and police brutality in America but the film doesn't get overly ""messagy"". It fights against the injustice with what it's good at, punchlines; non-stop laugh to laugh. We're taken on an increasingly periliess and ridiculous journey as the main characters are on the run whilst trying to solve the case and clear their name whilst also attending a party so that their friends don't suspect anything unusual. The cast are fantastic and if you want a film that's relatively short by today's standards and doesn't waste any time in getting to the laughs - this is the one. Loved it."
The Lovebirds,The Lovebirds,"6/10 - this one fell a little flat and was not nearly as funny as the trailer led me to believe, but it was still good enough to merit a viewing"
The Lovebirds,What's not to like?,"Two attractive lead actors, with great chemistry and funny AF, with their own unique brands of humor. Loved the way the movie brings it altogether, even what originally passed as just a trivial argument to movie the story line along. Great way to pass an afternoon during quarantine."
The Lovebirds,Surprisingly Funny,"At first, I was reluctant to watch ""The Lovebirds"". I thought it would be just another rom-com that clogs up Netflix to no end. What I got instead was a humorous, enjoyable, and relatively witty movie. The two leads had great chemistry, and whilst they were annoying at times, their funny lines compensated. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially couples looking for a date night movie.

Final Score: 67/100."

The Lovebirds,It's What's Up Doc meets the Big Easy,Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani have mad chemistry...when they are bickering. Suspend belief in the plot and just enjoy the wacky ride. I laughed out loud ever time the Lyft showed up.
The Lovebirds,Complete waste of time,"A lot of Netflix original movies have sucked for a while now. This joins the gang. Boring and totally not funny. I hope such movies (and Netflix) are not ushering in an era of such low budget, quick turnaround movies without too much thought into the entire process of filmmaking"
The Lovebirds,A 6??? The funniest movie I've seen in a LONG time,"What movie were the people who reviewed this watching? This movie is absolutely HILARIOUS. I usually only do reviews for horrible movies, but I haven't seen a movie this funny is a LONG time, so I felt a review was necessary. The chemistry between the main characters was unreal - like I felt like they were actually a couple in real life. Loved loved loved it."
The Lovebirds,Funny,"This is a far fetched story, but it is funny. It delivers laughs."
The Lovebirds,Entertaining Date Movie,"I like how the movie shakes up the traditional rom-com formula by focusing on characters who start off in a relationship rut. The film is also fairly funny, test still hits some emotional beats. It's not overly deep though, and is good for easy viewing."
The Lovebirds,Not Funny.,We really wanted to enjoy this movie but it was annoying how unfunny and forced this was. Granted we only made it 30 mins in. So take it for what it is.
The Lovebirds,Very funny moments,"Ok, 4 very, very funny scenes and 5 pretty funny moments. The 'what I call his penis' gag was a big 10/10. For a comedy; this is a 7/10. Plot is rather light and runs out of steam. Some glaring logical inconsistencies. Obviously low budget. Acting splendid, eve the small parts.

I'd love to see this cast with a bigger budget and more developed script."

The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,"A TV series about teens, for teens.","Started to watch this show without any expectations. The first two or three episodes got me hooked. Then, little by little, it started to feel more of the same episode after episode. And I must confess that i felt disappointed at the end. There's a lot of situations unlikely to happen in real life or all of the sudden as they are portraied in there. It's also technically inaccurate and many things are just impossible in real life. Psychologically heavy sometimes and incoherent. Don't get me wrong, the show, the characters the locations, the plot, captivate the audience very easily. It's worth watching if you're young (under 18 maybe), don't understand much about computer/technology and don't think much about the details. Then, you may love this show. Otherwise you will probably find it a bit of a waste of time."

The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Season 3 More of the Same,So Season 3 is more of the same with it continuing on until Graduation Day. Am disappointed with the relationships and has more whodunit mystery but kind of predictable. It is only a short season 3 with 8 episodes and enough is enough. Just when you think it is all over there is one last scene which suggest a season 4 may be coming but this should be enough really.
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Well done!!,"Each episode just gets better and better. Highly intriguing, good plot and subplot which make you watch until the end. I binged it in a day! There are a few plot holes, if you can ignore, 10/10 highly recommended!!"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Good idea but bad execution,"The story was firstly wery unnatural i had even goosebumps , but after it was pretty interesting despite still reminding me series Sherlock, (main character). Not great not terrible."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,very nice effort,"As a mexican spectator I can only ask for more quality content of this kind. maybe its biggest flaw is a somewhat lack of originality, but it's a nice show for binge watching. great acting, great production, some predictable stuff and some unpredictable plot twists too.

overall: nice."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,it's okay,"Tbh i didn't expect that much so i guess it's an ok series, the plot has a lot of similarities to any other teen tv show you could've already ever possibly watched so yeah, it's the regular kinda good. You don't get bored watching it, but also you don't get that much into it... idk"
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,Not the regular Mexican TV Show,"I'm mexican, so, for everyone out there saying that these actors look nothing like mexicans and all that, well that's the diversity of Mexico, we have people of all kind of color, race, ethnicity, social class. Mexico is not the typical stereotype of sombrero, mariachi, burro and that kind of stuff, and I love that Netflix is pitching TV shows that show this diversity, shows like this and El Club, also from Netflix, does that.

Now the show is really great, it's not a very original concept, but the themes and problematics are really important, not many mexican shows touch them. It's not a perfect show, but it's different. Obviously it has influences from Gossip Girl and Elite, so it makes it really interesting, the execution could be better though.

People should watch this, El Club, Ingobernable, Monarca, La Casa de las Flores and Club de Cuervos to see how diverse Mexico is."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,This was quite good.,"It reminded me of Veronica Mars, but imho better. Sofia is an outsider dealing with her own issues and going to high school. She is not the daughter of a PI but tends to be observant. One day a mystery comes up that engulfs her school and she and the new kid (sort of Wallace) set about to solve the mystery.

Each episode was well thought out and added to the last one. This also fixed some of the problems in VM. The mystery would be important to teens but no one else. Thus viewers wouldn't be wondering why the FBI wasn't showing up. The mystery was solvable if you paid attention and didn't involve cheating the audience. The explanation was perfectly paced for an entire episode so it felt earned.

I was shocked to discover this takes place in Mexico? Wow, I will not be seeing Mexico the same way again. Definitely worthy."
The Epic Tales of Captain Underpants,There are series that are a lot worst than this,"A Netflix's serie that doesn't totally represent Mexico's people and culture. Although being common, approaches some issues that are always important to remind that exists in this world. Not diverse though, which can be a thing to improve. Compensates with the great production and direction in Episode 3. Huge scene. Looked very real."

There are some moments(only a few ones) where the cinematography and the edition are impresive and beautiful. Michael Ronda is a great actor, nice to see him landing in a Netflix show. I wait another season.Netflix please don't cancel it! u cancel all good shows :( The main character (the girl) is like sherlock female for teens, I loved that."

Komi Can't Communicate,,
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Sarcasm is the best kind of humor and this show is full of it.,"Allthough Marc Maron is in this business since decades it was the first stand-up comedy from him for me. I thought it started a little slow but towards the end it became much better. I get it that not everybody finds this show funny, and that's just because some people just don't understand sarcasm, it's just not given to everyone, that's not an attack or so, it's just a fact. And Marc Maron's sarcasm is very well hidden, he doesn't make it obvious he's been sarcastic, so not everybody will get that even if you explained them what sarcasm is. To me he's a good storyteller, he's not very energetic on scene, no mimicing or playing characters, that's just not his style and that's fine. I was entertained, I laughed and grinned, so to me it was sufficient to have a good time watching and listening to End Times Fun."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Not his best,"Sure, it's funny...but it's also oddly less incisive than I've come to expect from Maron. With a bunch of observational humor, this is more like a hard-edged Seinfeld; and even the more incisive stuff is pretty juvenile (Pence is gay...groundbreaking). However, I do love how Maron is starting to physically match his grumpy old man mentality."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,on par with his pod,Huge fan of Maron aside from his political rantings. political humor is tacky imho so without the trump&Republican jokes I'd give it a 9/10
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Meh,"Had a couple of funny moments, but too few and far between."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Good timing on the release I guess,"I'm not sure if this release date was planned a while in advance, and yeah, it would be more interesting to speculate that Netflix are trying to capitalise on the panic regarding a brand new pandemic. Which hey, I'm hoping that panic will look at least a little overblown in a matter of months or years. Not to downplay the damage it'll cause, but I'm hopeful it won't lead to an actual end of times. And if my hope is misplaced, I suppose this review will vanish along with the Internet, so in that case, who cares? I'll be more concerned with scrounging for bottle caps (the inevitable new currency in a fallen apart world) and hunting squirrels or other small critters for nutrition by that point anyway.

Of course, the special itself was not filmed recently enough to capitalise on our most current anxieties and panics. Yet it's certainly thematically relevant, filmed I'm assuming around the mid-point of 2019. There was still a great deal to worry about back then, and so it's not too surprising that Maron looks outward, criticising and analysing external forces and institutions more than his own thoughts and actions. Thinky Pain at least was much more inward, and while this new special is to some degree, it's not as intensely psychological.

That definitely leads to an overall grimmer tone, and Maron gives enough reasons to justify his despair, even if I'm genuinely hoping that a lot of it is exaggerated for the sake of comedy. I might not be as pessimistic (although again: I can't entirely blame him if he really is as fearful as he comes across), but I still found a good deal to be entertained by here. There are a few excellent jokes here and there, while the rest range from decent to pretty good. Nothing here flops too badly; perhaps the final joke was a little weak (the audience didn't seem to get it either), and there isn't always a consistent flow that can elevate a good stand-up comedy special to a great one.

But if you've laughed at and enjoyed any of his past specials, you'll almost definitely find something to like in this one. It's bitter, dark, often a real bummer, but often quite funny at the same time. Not for everyone, and not exactly the kind of thing that fully picked me up in what is currently an overwhelming and quite uncertain time (again: I still have hope a new virus isn't going to totally end the world, although yeah it's probably gonna cause short to mid-term damage), but I guess we'll see.

It's funny. It made me laugh a few times despite my and the world's current downbeat mood. Come to think of it, perhaps that's even more impressive than what I'm giving Maron's latest credit for. Should I not be dead if (or hopefully when) things return to a sort of normalcy, I'll return to End Times Fun and see if raised spirits help me to find it funnier.

Will update, if there's still an Internet to update to at the end of all this..."

Marc Maron: End Times Fun,"Maron is awesome, period.","This is that raw dark humor with social commentary that I love. Unapologetic and honest to every funny bone, if you didn't know who Maron was before this, well now you know. He's gonna get a lotta hate and a lotta love. I'm with it. Just watch."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Had some funny points and weirdly some kinda scary points in this weird place we find ourselves since 2016 :O,"Overall, I found Marc funny and a pretty good time to watch.

His comments toward the End about who writes all the superhero stuff, and all the SuperHero Marvel Universe movies that are poured on us this last few years, and about Jesus 2nd coming, would have not made sense to me 10 years ago, but NOW, uhhh... hell, could be possible. :o Ha hahahha It's gettin that scary in the USA.

Worth a watch! :D."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,A brilliant humorist delivers another gem.,"I love his mind. I love his deep and dry, cheeky wit. This one absolutely kills. It may not be a laugh a minute, like Thnky Pain or Too Real, but the last 10 minutes had me in tears."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Wasn't funny,"It's supposed to be a stand up show so I'll judge it only as that - it simply was not funny. Through the whole hour he managed to crack a smile from me only once.

I personally have nothing against Marc, he seems like a smart man and I did like some of the things he said but I was simply not amused. Sorry."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Best special to date,"Marc Maron at his best. Well done. The only thing that is completely irrelevant is that I wish he'd cut his hair so he doesn't look 70 years old. He's not an old guy, but any time I try to show people him...it's Hard to get people to watch an old guy let alone like an old guy."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,TED Talk,"At one point he said ""I think this is sort of the TED Talk portion of my show"", but the entire show is like a TED Talk. Literally didn't laugh or chuckle, not even once."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Absolutely hilarious,"I don't care what the haters say. He's extremely honest and crude in a way that's hilarious, insightful, and humbling. I've never seen his work before, but now I definitely need to see more now !"
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Possibly offensive material to some.,"I don't get the hate, I might honestly rate it a 9, but in no way should it be anywhere near 6 stars. Maybe too political for some. Between this and too real, sure if watch too real. I hope to see more some time soon. Maron is certainly political, and would certainly offend some. End Times Fun is certainly geared to a left leaning non-religious anti-religous crowd. There is tons of sarcasm. Oh and of course I imagine some marvel fans might get butthurt. I in some sense love the marvel universe, and completely agree with the road Mr. Maron heads down in this special. So I writing not call this the things spoilers, but correct me if I'm wrong."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Got bored 20 minutes in,"You always hear other comics talking about Marc Maron, but like he mentioned in the opening of this special, I couldn't name one single thing he's done until he mentioned them. And I watched the whole first season of Glow.

I normally love comedy specials, and usually go see live shows whenever I can. I liked Bert Kreischer, Tom Segura, Norm Macdonald (saw him live), Christina P (saw her live), but this was painfully unfunny.

I couldn't finish."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Not funny,"The world is not ending despite what Maron says. We get it your a liberal, nothing wrong with that per se, but it's just so exhausting listening to someone with enough money and clout to afford to stay in California complain incessantly. Just write some jokes, please! The audience reflects that, and he almost seems shocked when they don't laugh at the end of his drawn out bits. All young comics should watch this as an example of how to not be funny, everyone else don't waste your hour."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Well...,"We could pretty much see his personality in Glow. We like his self-deprecating type of character because it goes well with the premise and all. But to know that, and still try to watch his new standup, we knew what we were in for. But seriously? Get over it. Trump was elected and for you to get a small venue full of people applaud you for saying he's the worst person of anything, ever, only to placate your own views and get said roomful of liberals to laugh and applaud is just sad. We shut it off after a few minutes because we're so. sick. of. it."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,Painfully unfunny.,End Times Fun is the definition of contemporary hack.
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,A boring TED Talk,"After watching it for 30 minutes or so, and not even cracking a smile, I decided to stop watching this boring TED talk about Trump and nerds... it's basically: Old man yelling at clouds.

I'm not even from the US so I don't care about Trump either way, but it's such a cheap trick to just bash on Trump and think that's comedy somehow.

Meh...."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,"Yeah yeah yeah, you hate the right","Another lefty thinking I hate 90% of this country is funny. Jeez, ya wonder why network TV and especially cable news are tanking. We want to be entertained, not indoctrinated by Hoolywierd."
Marc Maron: End Times Fun,I'm a big Marc Maron fan ..... but this isn't his best,"Three laughs and one 'ah ha' moment. So glad this wasn't the first time I saw Marc Maron - otherwise it would probably would be the last. Yet yes, I still gave him 5 stars - for the three laughs and the ah ha moment.

Am not sure what happened. It's like he waited until the night before to write his set. Maybe he should have left it at an hour instead of 90 very long minutes.

I don't why people ding him on the political jokes - he's a comedian for Pete's sake. They bash anyone who's in the White House - get over it!!

I am glad I didn't pay to go see him in person. It would have been a disappointment."
Glitch,Season 1 & 2 AMAZING! Season 3 complete GARBAGE,"If there was rating that could be given for season 1 & 2 only it would be 10 and season 3 about 4 so I met the score at 6. I don't know why this show went off rails whether they were in rush or just simply diddn't care that it was ending. So many glaring plot holes, subplots that added virtually nothing to story line, and poor explanations for things going on in the show. By the time credits role around for season 3 you're left so angry and frustrated. What a waste of what I considered to be an amazing series."
Glitch,Quintessence,"If I could rate season 1 and 2 separately from the third thing - that would be great. Enjoyed 1 and 2 very much despite the obvious ""bad physics"" or ""bad science"". Season 3 is just a huge disappointment. More so because I was really intrigued and looking forward to it. Sad. And bad."
Glitch,Started with a Bang! Ended with a huge thud!!,"The first two season of this were absolutely fantastic. Unique, a sorta X-files meets The walking dead. A group of people from all walks of life and from different era's wake up from their slumber (death) in a small Australian town, and the local sheriff must figure out what going on, as well as those that just woke up. They too want to know. Is it a science experiment, is the apocalypse, is Armageddon? We don't know, and frankly we sorta figure it out in a very disappointing 3rd season.

The 3rd season is ridiculous, 6 episodes to tie it up and you pull a game of thrones final season on us, where nothing really happens, we learn nothing until the final episode and then its over. I get that #Netflix doesn't renew foreign shows, or really any shows unless they are award winners past season 3, but you still could have made it engaging. Literally nothing happens in the 3rd season that is worth noting. Ahh well, moving on the next show to be cancelled by Netflix."
Glitch,I thought it better than multiple other versions of The Returned,"I have seen the French original, which I liked. Did not like the first US remake called Resurrection. Then a US cable channel did an exact copy of the original French version, and I hate it when they can't even come up with some different dialog! I give a lot of credit to this Australian take on the theme. It was more mysterious, and also had a bit more of a conspiracy theory feel to it. I felt the reactions of the people dealing with the returned dead were the most realistic. Also really liked that the different eras that the returned dead were from made for some really interesting story lines. I really enjoyed it. Hope it will ""return""!"
Glitch,If you like 'the Returned' you'll probably like Glitch,"Glitch is basically an Aussie version of 'The Returned' complete with bushrangers and diggers. It's definitely binge worthy so kudos to ABC for sticking all the eps on iview rather than making us wait. I liked the distinct Aussie feeling to this show and the characters were likable and had interesting back stories. The overall story line is good and hooks you in. However, a few things bugged me, like the lack of amazement and confusion from the older characters in particular at just how much society had changed. There were hints of this but not enough to make how long they'd been dead realistic in my opinion. No one really questioned anything or gave cars, modern medicine, mobile phones etc. a second thought. Paddy lighting fires in summer when it was clearly dry and bush fire season also irked me a lot. But overall I enjoyed it and I hope netflix or someone picks it up so audiences outside of Australia can (legally) watch it. I liked the twist at at the end, and I would watch season 2 if it gets made. There are several unanswered questions at the end of season 1."
Glitch,Season 3 needs to be buried,"Season 1 was great. Season 2 was good. But Season 3 was beyond awful. Typical of movies today, it was only good for evil conspiracies and bad endings. It was like the Matrix. The first movie was great and imaginative. The other two were awful. It's just that watching Season 3 to its conclusion, left me angry in the end, making me with I hadn't watched it at all."
Glitch,Reviewing after season 2,Comentario no disponible
Glitch,It's a lot better than I thought,"Glitch is loosely based on the premise from the French TV series ""Les Revenants"" which is excellent. For this reason I was hesitant to watch Glitch as I just didn't see how an Australian remake could top the original. I was also worried it might have turned a little more zombie apocalypse. However I was wrong, it's not a remake, and it's not a zombie series. It's takes a different angle on the theme from ""Les Revenants"" which is refreshing and clever. One of the best things about Glitch is how it never quite gives the game away, and whilst the idea of re-incarnation is a hard sell they never had me scoffing in disbelief. It's clever, and it's twisty turny in it's plot. Another really great aspect to the show is the warm inner glow you will get from time to time with respect to family members, you might be moved to shed a tear, just as ""Les Revenants"" was prone to do. If they make a season 2, I will be watching."

Glitch,Dropped the ball in Season 3,"I absolutely loved the first two seasons of this and was so excited for Season 3 but I was very disappointed. It started quite promising then just plods along with not very much direction. If season 4 happens I sincerely hope they pick up the pace. Such a shame because on the whole, the series plot is fabulous"
Glitch,Good on you Aussies! (Seriously!!!!),"No spoilers here. Was very bored and thought I'd give 'Glitch' a go especially as I thought if I like the first episode, I can watch the entire Series 1 in few hours as it was made available on iView. I got hooked by the very first minute as it starts action, excitement, intrigue, suspense immediately. The only reason I didn't give it 10 was there were a couple of douche bag moments of acting but can't remember them now as I am still trying to work out what how when why and of course when is the next series coming!!!!! Excellent work. I am certain this will receive many awards and nominations. (The show, writers, actors, producer, directors et al). Thank you for this!"
Glitch,Decent Aussie show.,Different but definitely worth watching. Season 3 was rubbish. Strange end. I think they ran out of ideas.
Glitch,Started off great and ended terrible.,Comentario no disponible
Glitch,Ummm what?,"I would have given this a much higher score as I adored this show, loved it and then came season 3, utter confusion, character letdowns and nonsense. Watch season 1 and 2 and imagine season 3, you'll be much happier"
Glitch,Another excellent Australian production.,"This show was one of the best series I've seen ever. Well written, keeps you interested. I really hope that it continues. The story line is completely different from other resurrection plots. The acting, and I mean every single one, is spot on with their characters. The scenery is fabulous. I am very curious to see where the next season goes.I have to say that the shows I've watched coming out of Australia's TV shows very talented artists from writers, actors producers, directors, art makeup and all involved with the production. I'm looking forward to more great shows. It was extremely entertaining. Thank you for sharing all your talents with me,sincerely."
Glitch,What if? A well-made Australian series,"I have just binge watched season 1 of Glitch and found it a well thought-out fantasy with the characters each having a role to play. It has suspense and never becomes drawn out and keeps you guessing what is to happen next.

Although the theme is not original it is way above the glitch of American series in this genre we have endured over the last few years. Glitch has a manageable number of arisen people so their stories and conundrums can be fully experienced and appreciated. Well done to Netflix for bringing this series to the world.

I never overrate a movie or series, so my rating of 7 is well justified. After a few days rest I will tackle season 2 and hope it doesn't run out of steam as those American series which had to be cancelled subsequently.

Update: I binge watched season 2 as well, which is as good as season 1. All in all a thrilling drama which does have a proper conclusion why it happened and who was responsible. A teaser is shown at the end for viewers to imagine a continuation for self-satisfaction."
Glitch,A very fun show,"Everything about this show screams potential. The premise itself may not be highly original, but I've never seen any film or television program execute these ideas in this way.

Patrick Brammall and Emma Booth deliver very believable performances as a couple who has been reunited after 2 years. While their storyline is the main focus, the show adopts a ""freak of the week"" structure where the rest of the gang get their own subplots that explain their death and flesh out their character even more. Most of the characters are very likable, and their dialogue reflects the time period in which they lived. I love this little detail, as it makes every character feel unique and I often found myself wanting to know more about them.

One thing Glitch gets right more than anything is the suspense. The writers give you just enough clues to keep you interested while never fully explaining the situation. While this sounds like it would be frustrating, it is probably the most enjoyable thing about the show. My friends and I were always debating after each episode, and it was interesting to see how our theories changed as the series went on.

Another thing I loved was the score. Composer Cornel Wilczek delivers a unique and emotional series of songs that always capture the tone of the scene perfectly. The opening title song is particularly captivating.

Glitch is a very entertaining show, and there really isn't much I don't like. I'm looking forward to season 2."
Glitch,Incredible seasons 1&2... Season 3 not worth mentioning.,"I still can't believe what they've done. How could they make such incredible 2 seasons, and then finish everything with such a load of sh***. Come on. Something must have happened here. The way it all ended was so ridiculous that I can't even put it into words. Plus, the last episode looked like it was made with a mobile phone camera, and a cheap special effects app. SO disappointing! Why? WHY? It was so fresh, so interesting and so, so good... Maybe they could make another season in which the 3rd one would turn out to be a bad dream. Honestly, the Glitch had a huge potential, but so far it has been the most disappointing Netflix series ever. And it didn't have to be."
Glitch,I Need More of this Drug...,"One of the few shows I was immediately hooked on from the first few minutes of the first episode. But I could not help but feel that after six episodes, I felt ripped off and wanted to find the producers and hold them hostage for a guarantee of a few more episodes... but I maintained my composure and sucked it up.

The Actors: Perfect! There are a variety of acting styles brought to the table and I feel that this, along with the story line, was the perfect recipe for a great show. I'm not a 'Walking Dead' fan by no means at all, but this show is incomparable in every way, hence, the positive review.

The Story Line: Nope! You have to watch it. If you have Netflix, check out the first, and only, season... I am hoping for a second season or a continuation of the first.

Location: Down Under, Australia... How cool is that. 'Bout time we got something from our friends from 'down under'...

The bottom line: I want more! I know... Who cares about what I want. But this is 'GOLD'. I still have so many questions about the story and the plot. I can guess the answers, but that's no fun.

Looking forward to another fix..."
Glitch,Who made the 3rd season??,"So nice the 1st&2nd season. This people coming back to the world woow totaly different from other shows.

It is creative original and good suspense.

The aussie accent earn some points.

3rd season better don t talk.

Without 3rd is between 8 to 9."

The Pink Panther 2,"Stupid, predictable...but still funny !","Even though I knew the movie had been panned by the critics, I still agreed to go along with my friends to watch it. As the credits rolled in the end, I sat wondering what were the critics expecting from the movie...

Of course the plot is stupid, the end is predictable. But the movie delivers what every comedy intends to deliver...lots of good laughs ! If the reviewers were expecting a thought provoking plot, Oscar winning performances, or a great achievement in ""moving image""...perhaps they bought the wrong movie ticket. Also, I have not seen the original Peter Sellers movie. Looks like every Peter Sellers fan hates the new series. But I really don't see why shouldn't I enjoy the jokes in Pink Panther 2 just because Peter Sellers was funnier.

This may not be the funniest movie of the year. But its 1.5 hours well enjoyed ! Don't get swayed by the critics...go and have fun in this movie !"
The Pink Panther 2,Harmless Fun,"I'm not ready to get out the torches and pitchforks and lead a lynch mob after Mr Martin -- not yet anyway! Having read the early reviews here, I went to the cheapo theater with low expectations, and emerged pleasantly surprised. There were some genuine laughs from time-to-time, plus a great cast (shoulda got more out them). My daughter and grandchildren were delighted.

The overall plot is reasonably clever -- so, that leaves the gags. Some work - some don't work that well, as evidenced by the fact that many IMDb'ers want to talk about why some of the gags don't 'feel right', or seem to 'take too long'. (No really successful comedians ever had people talk about how their gags don't seem to be working -- people just talk about how much they laughed. When people start analyzing why your comedy isn't funny, it ain't workin'). But we had a few chuckles in this one, if not a bunch of sustained belly laughs.

Everyone says we should stop comparing Steve Martin to Peter Sellers, but, if you watched the original films, how can you stop comparing? Sellers created this character, just as Atkinson created Mr. Bean and Cleese created Basil Fawlty. And Steve Martin tries to do Sellers anyway (his 'little yellow friend' line?). He can't quite pull it off, and he hasn't really found a shtick that works. For one thing, his eyes are always popping, like he's trying to pass gas. Sellers' eyes were quiet. His Clouseau was genuinely 'clueless'. And, I've mentioned elsewhere at IMDb that Sellers was a major Radio comedy star before doing films - that puts him in a league with Abbott & Costello, Burns & Allen, Bob Hope and Jack Benny. These guys built amazing gags that kept both live and radio audiences in stitches, using well-constructed devices such as bizarre characterizations, rapid exchanges, and nifty voices. Mr. Martin's roots in comedy are from a different - and later - era.

Overall, though, if you need an amusing and harmless diversion, go see this at the reduced-price theater. For $4, I'm in - $20 for a date and me, plus popcorn? where are those torches and pitchforks?

6/10 canuckteach"
The Pink Panther 2,Funny and entertaining follow-up with the clumsy Inspector Clouseau-Steve Martin,"Again the Pink Panther with Steve Martin as the inept , botcher inspector . Three important burglaries shock Governments of Britain, Italy and Japan where are robbed the Japanese Imperial sword, the Great Bill , and Shroud of Turin prompting governments to set up a detective 'dream team' to resolve these crimes supposedly committed by a criminal named 'Tornado'. France there are a great mayhem for the robbery of his ¨Pink Panther¨ an enormously expensive diamond and assigns bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau, his assistant Gilbert Ponton (Jean Reno), and Secretary, Nicole (Emily Mortimer), to this issue . Although Chief Inspector Dreyfus (John Cleese replacing Kevin Kline)from the Surete would much prefer seeing Clouseau issuing traffic tickets. The team, consisting of detectives from Britain (Alfred Molina), Japan (Matsuzaki), and Italy (Andy Garcia), and Sonia Solandres (Aishwarya Ray) who attempts to woo Clouseau with shady aims . They travel to Italy where 'Tornado' reportedly inhabits , being the main suspect an aristocrat (Jeremy Irons). This is where they will face their worst mission . Bungling Inspector Clouseau hasn't clues but it doesn't mind . He along with his helper Gilbert Ponton are going into disgraces, mishap , botches and wreak havoc from Paris to Rome. Then the international dream team is humiliated and newspapers publicize: ¨ Bungler Clouseau a disgrace, entire nation loses panache, French detective idiot ¨ .

The film gets entertaining and fun with hilarious moments here and there and never slowdown although contains others ridiculous and disappointing . The picture takes parts from previous entries Sellers' movies (Pink Panther, Shot in dark,The return,revenge,Panther strikes again). As Steve Martin struggles with two kids imitating Sellers and his Kung Fu fighting with Cato -Burt Kwouk- . Steve Martin combines splendidly his comic talent at his peak doing a witty spoof of the absurdities of Peter Sellers character. Evolves famous costars as Alfred Molina, Andy Garcia , John Cleese , a gorgeous Idian star as Rai and many others ; furthermore a magnificent opening cartoon titles. As always lively and jolly music ( arranged by Christophe Beck ) by the great Henry Mancini. Several chuckles and gags ,the result of which is a funny film . Film gets memorable occasion for amusing and entertainment. This sequel is better than Steve Martin's former entry ."
The Pink Panther 2,Why Bother!!!,"I've never written a comment before and this is the first movie I'm writing one. Well, many of you have heard from the critics that the movie was not good, also you might have seen some of the comments or heard it from other persons advising you to ignore the critics and that the movie was good. But the comedy in the movie was so PREDICTABLE and its like Steve Martin is forcing you to laugh!!! Clearly, if you have seen the first movie DON'T BOTHER watching this one as many comic scenes were similar to the prequel. I wasted one and half hour in my life and don't do that mistake again..

But if you have not seen any of the previous Pink Panther's movie then its worth a shot. For starters there were very few moments in the movie which was worth laughing but most of the time its like 'I see what you trying to get' Its such a pity to see Steve Martin acting in the movie which suppressed his individuality. I was hoping much from this film, but was clearly disappointed."
The Pink Panther 2,"French, Fun","True to the first installment, The Pink Panther 2 begins with much promise by way of Inspector Clouseau's own brand of semi slapstick humor, loses its way somewhere around the middle, and then finds it again to round off a fairly watchable movie. As far as humor is concerned, one gets the feeling that there is an overlap of far too many elements  the stereotypes, the action sequences, the warped logic, the karate kid family create sequences that are delightful but in certain instances a trifle too much. Good to see Aishwariya in a substantial role, not the least towards the end. The ending is definitely not guessable, though I am not sure whether it is entirely logical. Well, all is fair in Clouseau's end-justifies-the-means-and-hilarity world"
The Pink Panther 2,Shockingy Unfunny.,"Atrocious. Abysmal. Deplorable. Unacceptable. Lamentable. Unforgivable.

These nasty cash-ins really must stop. How Blake Edwards hasn't stalked everybody involved in these fiascos with a shotgun, I'll never know.

The first one was sickeningly unfunny and now we are faced with another trauma to deal with.

Peter Sellers was born to play Clouseau. No one else dare step into his shoes. That way lies disaster and ridicule.

How these abominations make it to the big screen is a mystery. When they are filming them, surely they must know that it isn't working out. Then again, it's hard to show restraint when even your underwear is made of $100 bills. Rich people making themselves richer, even at the cost of their own reputations. Very sad.

This thing makes even 'Curse Of The Pink Panther' look like a defining moment in cinema history. At least 'Curse' had Herbert Lom."
The Pink Panther 2,I liked it,"Many critics dislike this movie. Reading their comments I still do not understand why. The movie has many funny moments. The audience I watched this movie with seemed to like it.

I wonder what people expect from a silly movie about a bumbling policeman getting into embarrassing situations. The most usual comment from critics is that Peter Sellers was a much better Clouseau. I am a big fan of the original movies. What Peter Sellers had that Steve Martin is lacking is the arrogance. I am talking about the arrogance Peter Sellers' Clouseau displayed when had just made a fool of himself. Nevertheless, I think Steve Martin made a good Clouseau. I would definitely recommend this movie. Relax and enjoy."
The Pink Panther 2,An insult,"This movie is a huge insult to Peter Sellers, The Pink Panther, and everything concerned. It's also an insult to the once-funny Steve Martin's past, and it's tragic he doesn't seem to realise it (which is almost unbelievable). Why? Because it's not funny, it's that simple. Had it not been for the legacy, it would simply be another not-funny-at-all mess that regretfully made some money for the schmucks that produced and wrote it (I guess people will go see it because of all the stars, which should be enough). But because of the legacy, many young viewers will have their experience of the real Pink Panther series biased and maybe spoiled for ever. It's like spitting on Peter Sellers' grave. Another review I've just read says ""The Pink Panther 2 proves Steve Martin is now nothing more than a paycheck-cashing hack"" - now, that's harsh, at least I didn't say that myself!"

The Pink Panther 2,An Honest Attempt,"As I said in my review of the first installment of this line: Steve Martin has walked in the Valley of the Kings. He has faced some pretty amazing obstacles, and he has stood in some pretty big shadows. Let's face it. Although his rendition of, ""The Out-of-Towners,"" was amusing, he's no Jack Lemmon. While I LOVE his Sgt. Bilko portrayal, he's not Phil Silvers. Cheaper by the Dozen wasn't horrible, but he's not Clifton Webb, either. He's Steve Martin.

You may not appreciate his style of comedy, but the Peter Sellers-venerated character of Inspector Jacques Clouseau made for the best use of Martin's prolific use of pratfalls, ironic wit, and in your face sarcasm than any other character he has tackled previously.

But the character portrayed by Martin herein has something I never saw in Sellers' portrayal after the second installment...genuine heart. This is sweetly honest in its attempt. I feel that this will actually turn into a legitimate franchise reboot, if the average movie-goer will stop attempting to compare Martin's Clouseau to Sellers' Clouseau. They are two different actors, and Martin has stated to the point of nausea that he is NOT attempting to ""do"" Sellers' interpretation of the character!

As far as the MOVIE goes, it is sweet, funny, and enduring with a strong story, a stronger relationship element, and a great cast. I did not miss Kevin Kline nearly as much as I supposed I would. John Cleese was a perfect Dreyfus, showing us the beginnings of Herbert Lom's trademark twitch, when dealing with Clouseau. Very nice!

I think, when looking back, Steve Martin's Jacques Clouseau will be remembered fondly by the new generations, just as prior generations stubbornly cling to Sellers' character in spite of Martin's superior portrayal.

All in all? I love it. It is a(n almost) violence-free, blood-free, honest attempt at a family film. This is great! and I cannot wait to get it into my collection.

It rates an 8.4/10 from...

the Fiend :."
The Pink Panther 2,Watchable: The Bungling French Detective Is Back.,"Having watched almost all the previous and Pink Panther movies which starred the late Peter Sellers as the bungling, world famous and the legendary French detective, Inspector Jacques Clouseau and Herbert Lom as Chief Inspector Dreyfus, I was looking forward to this one, as I had previously watched the 2006 one as well.

A bungling traffic cop is called upon to join a team who are investigating treasures that are being stolen. But he fears that someone will steal the famous diamond as soon as he leaves France.

Starring Steve Martin, John Gleese (former ""Monty Python"" actor and famously remembered for his character as ""Basil Fawlty"" in ""Fawlty Towers"" TV series), Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Emily Mortimer, Geoffrey Palmer, Andy Garcia, Jean Reno, Jeremy Irons and Jack Metzger, this is directed by Herald Zwart and is written by Scott Neustadter, Michael H. Webber and Steve Martin.

This Pink Panther cannot be compared to the ones that starred the late Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom. The jokes  the gags are there and are good but something or the other makes it predictable, which the previous ""Pink Panthers"" didn't and this is perhaps the biggest let down to a ""watchable"" level in terms of rating. Steve Martin is quite convincing and does make one laugh and this is perhaps the saving point of this movie. But unfortunately, the same cannot be said for John Gleese - bit of a let down there and the character of ""Cato,"" the karate servant, which was played by Burt Kwouk in the previous ones, is missed even though reference to the martial art are there.

Nevertheless, this is a movie that is worth watching once but if, like me you have enjoyed the previous Pink Panthers, then one should not expect much from this and should not compare it with them.. And finally, what can be said about the former Miss World, Aishwarya Rai (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) except that she looks good and has performed well."
The Pink Panther 2,Did not need to be made,"This is a good example of a film that was totally unnecessary. The original ""Pink Panther"" films starring Peter Sellers were very funny and artfully done. The Steve Martin ventures are basically unfunny crap. Spending money to view a film as awful as Martin's ""Pink Panther 2"" is an unpardonable waste of resources. You would be better served by buying a DVD of the Peter Sellers rendition of ""Pink Panther 2"".

Steve Martin needs to find fresh new material that has never been previously filmed. He used to be funny, and has made some very enjoyable films in the past. His recent remakes of previously done material have been awful stinkers."
The Pink Panther 2,Steve Martin Is Losing It,"Sorry, but Steve Martin as Inspector Clouseau just does not make it. There is only one Clouseau, and that's Peter Sellers. I can't understand why Martin has done this, except his ego has gotten so big he thinks he's funny enough to pull it off. Well I have news for Steve: Forget it! Both of these Pink Panther remakes are totally lame travesties and nothing more than cheap imitation cash-grabs. Steve Martin, go back to doing what you're good at, being Steve Martin, not a second-rate, amateur, really bad imitation of Peter Sellers. As for John Cleese, he must be hard up for cash. That's the only reason I can see him doing this. Obviously the Hollywood marketing people have aimed this piece of junk at the juvenile market which is too young to know about Peter Sellers."

The Pink Panther 2,Garbage,"I cannot understand why this movie was made? How can Steve Martin live with himself? He should be buried alive for foisting this abomination on the viewing public. Peter Sellars was a true genius and an unrivalled master as a comic actor in this role. His acting was both intelligent and inspired; Steve Martin on the other hand has simply made himself look utterly stupid. In any event I feel that Kevin Klein would have made a far better job of the Clouseau role if it had to be done at all. A great part of the charm of the Pink Panther movies was derived from the exclusively sixties flavour, the vehicles, the fashion and above all the actors who were extraordinarily well cast. The original Pink Panther movies attracted a varied and selective audience whereas the modern Pink Panther could only attract the accolade of the terminally stupid. Could we perhaps organise a petition to stop Steve Martin from repeating this offensive twaddle or maybe have a whip round and buy him off."
The Pink Panther 2,Martin continues the tradition in this harmless chapter of the series,Comentario no disponible
The Pink Panther 2,What's the point?,"The first one was plenty and with a sequel, you would expect Steve Martin to try harder this time around. At least with ""Pink Panther 1"", I had quite a few laughs. Here, there was nothing funny during this movie. The experience I had in the theater was the same as when I saw ""The Love Guru"", sitting there amazed and stone-faced without a single laugh. Steve Martin can act really well and he can be extremely funny. All Of Me, Roxanne, Parenthood, The Man with Two Brains, etc. are all proof that this man can do better than this and The Pink Panther 2 ruins his charm. The plot...what plot? There was none! Nothing happening, sophomoric jokes, and frankly it was boring! This franchise is beyond dead and there's no excuse for Martin's actions, receiving a 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. Not to mention that this was a serious financial flop! It was just a chance for Martin to cash in on the movie as Peter Sellers rolls in his grave. It's pointless and I wasted my time with this garbage. Do the same and don't waste your time or money on this disaster of a movie!"
The Pink Panther 2,"So many Whiners, So little information","OK after reading through a few pages of these so-called ""reviews"" I gotta say this, Peter Sellers is dead, get over it.

He has been dead for longer than a billion people has been alive, and most wont remember him or even know about his Pink Panther movies, so stop comparing them.

If you can't watch the movie without bias to a guy who has been dead for nearly 30 years, then PLEASE don't bother posting a review, 10 pages of ""Steve Martin is not Peter Sellers"" don't review a movie.

OK rant over, for the review.

The movie is actually both quite good and quite fun for someone who has never seen more to The Pink Panther than the cartoon, now I'm not gonna lie, it's not a super-box-office-hit or anything, it wont make the Top10 or even Top50 list, but it's definitely not a 1 or a 2 or any of these things the Peter Sellers fan boys are giving it.

If you go in expecting some fun comedy and without previous expectations concerning past movies you will not be disappointed, and if you are a Steve martin fan then it will get a bit better than that."
The Pink Panther 2,Awful,"Steve Martin is embarrassing. The movie is downright awful. Martin's attempt at a French accent is simply annoying.

There are scenes that are visually entertaining, such as the wine juggle. John Cleese, as usual, is quite funny. Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau was funny in the original movie. However, Martin in the same role is simply foolish. I got up from my seat and left the other four in my party when I just couldn't stand it anymore and went to the plex next door to see part of a lame romantic comedy rather than risk hating myself for wasting my life watching another minute of The Pink Panther 2. I haven't walked out of a movie in probably 40 years! I met up with the group later, the were decidedly disappointed in the film-- and no long fans of Steve Martin."
The Pink Panther 2,Better than I've expected to be!,"My opinion is that it was better than the 1st one. It was quick,the plot very interesting,I was easily absorbed(I did not realized how the time passed).As I was watching it in Greece some jokes were not very funny for those who do not understand English(as some quotes were like rhyming).I certainly would watch it again-I like this kind of humor. The actors were like a surprise to me because I did not know about the cast. The only thing that made made make a face was the pronunciation, from the beginning of the film mostly Mrs.Nicole made it too pronounced-of course ""they were"" french people but it was too much pointed out.The whole film was too good,I laughed with tears,the audience was attentive, everything went well-so good that I was not expected it -I have the opinion that part 2 can not be as good as the 1st one.Regards!"
The Pink Panther 2,If you are in the mood for funny this is an excellent choice for everyone.,We enjoyed this film from start to finish. The audience was roaring with laughter at all the right times. Money & Time well spent one can't ask for more. Thanks for the entertainment to all those who had hands and ideas in the film.Keep making films. Helpful info: Get there early to get your popcorn/treats and beverages you don't want to miss any bit of it. I find if you sit up higher in the audience one's eyes relax and are able to take in the whole film without feeling you are pressed against a window shield in a smart car. 10/10 STARS. I do hope parents will convey that stunt people were used and if those things ever happened there could be deadly consequences.
The Pink Panther 2,Amusing and at times outright funny.,"Not as good as the first Steve Martin remake, but still amusing and at times outright funny. Most of the humor consists of sight gags and slapstick, but there are some quite funny scenes such as when Inspector Clouseau interrogates the Pope with hilarious results or Inspector's lessons on proper etiquette from Mrs. Berenger played by Lily Tomlin who is wonderful in this movie. Other parts of the movie fall flat. The rest of the cast is also funny. John Cleese playing a Frenchman was excellent. This story is innocuous enough to have been rated G. Good movie, entertaining, light fare. One problem with the movie is that Jean Reno seemed to be miscast. In the first movie he plays a serious role but here he plays a buffoon and sidekick to the hapless Clouseau. It did not work. A strong actor like Jean Reno should have strong roles."
The Pink Panther 2,More Like The Pink Crap-ther,"I've had poops full of more laughter -- intentional and unintentional -- than ""The Pink Panther 2."" Where to begin? Well, Steve Martin is no Peter Sellers. Here the silver-haired comic comes off more like a bad Robert Hegyes impersonator with Styrofoam chips in his mouth. He hasn't been this bad since ""The Crotch Chronicles,"" and that is saying something. Where is the man who made us giggle with characters like The Jerk and ""Sloppy Ivan"" French? The plot, if you want to call it that, has no coherence. Since when was physical violence funny? Or people falling from buildings? Tigers that wipe their own butts? It's all a mishmash of hokum that never lives up to its potential. Why didn't they bring in Bull from ""Night Court""? He'd be on target in the hilarity department. In conclusion, I do not recommend ""The Pink Panther 2."""
The Pink Panther 2,Haven't we suffered enough....isn't there enough pain in this world...!,"I didn't get past watching the first 10 minutes of this drivel.!! . 10 minutes that I'll never get back. This film did not even achieve my lowest expectations. I'm reachin' out to Mr Martin here.PLEASEPLEASEPLEASE PLEASE..stop makin' these films..why are you makin' us suffer dude? I had such respect for your work and then you go and pull a stunt like this. I'm no purist and do not believe that Peter Seller's was the one an only Inspector Closeau.I enjoyed Alan Arkins take on the role very much as well. I do believe Mr Martin could have had some potential in the role..but my god the scripts for PP and PP2 have been absolutely diabolically lame. The jokes and gags all seem to be forced, childish with a lot of unwarranted toilet humour.

If I could give this film a lower mark than 1 then I would have done so.! Dennis the Pennis was right.Mr Martin.when did you stop being funny ?."
The Hows of Us,,
Spyder,,
Feel Good,"So refreshing and real, And Mea is superb...","This show is intense and lovely, the jokes and the drama feels so real. It's very emotional and sweet and very much relatable to everyone. The fact that is in located in England with the sprinkles of that typical British humor makes it even more interesting.

I think it's a must watch."
Feel Good,Cathartic Comedy,"There's a bit of a spate of quasi-biography comedian-as-themselves type drama/comedies on British TV in the last few years but Mae Martin's brittle and razor sharp tale of rehabilitation, relapse and relationships is by far and away the most painful and beautiful of all of them. Aided by a remarkably strong support cast (Charlotte Ritchie is spellbinding here particularly - and you keenly miss Sophie Thompson in the second series) but all oscillating around a mesmerically layered performance from Martin. Feel Good can really genuinely hurt you but there's a powerful strength to it to. Deeply underrated and not to be ignored."
Feel Good,Much Needed Representation and A Heartfelt Romance!,"I was happily surprised when I heard that there was going to be a show like this. A story involving a sexually fluid comedian would never have been told ten years ago, but times have changed since then. Mae Martin plays herself essentially since it is based off of her life. In interviews she has stated that this was her life about ten years ago.

The series focuses on her romance with George (Charlotte Ritchie), who has predominantly been straight for her entire life. As a result of being straight her whole life, she keeps it a secret that she is dating Mae from her horrible friend Binky (Ophelia Lovibond). That is not the only problem however. Both rely on one another far too much and have intense separation anxiety when apart.

Mae sees her relationship with George as an addiction. For years, Mae was addicted to all forms of narcotics. The writing is superb for effectively showing how Mae is dependent on George. Not only is the writing excellent at showing Mae's addiction to George, but how an addict also obsesses over one object or person. This was educational for me because I never thought addictions as trading one addiction for another. Another fascinating plot device was that Mae gets ringing in her ears when confronted with narcotics. Overall, the writing was phenomenal.

The series also shows the impact of addiction. Mae's parents are played by Lisa Kudrow and Adrian Lukis. There is a love there, but it is strained because of Mae's past activities. Episode 4 is very heartbreaking because their relationship is explored, but it is an amazing episode and full of several different emotions.

The show is absolutely hilarious too. Mae is super funny and loving with George. Another source of comedy is George's roommate Phil (Phil Burgers) who is from California and is completely zany.

Lastly, I am most pleased with the representation. There are stories about straight white men and women frequently with little variety. Recently, I am happy that has changed. Shows like Ramy and Fleabag have changed that. I hope to see stories like these become a commodity in the future. I definitely suggest this show to watch, it is absolutely amazing!!!"
Feel Good,Confusion based reviews,"A lot of the negative reviews I've read is more about the confusion about mental health, no matter how much you think you get it unless you've lived it you just don't, for someone fully functioning I get why you'd question chemistry or the quick ups and downs but it's so damn real, you could have the perfect person but if you cannot relax and get your brain to enjoy it you are just doomed, they both make mistakes and bad choices but it's true to form for both sides, one needs a rock for mental stability, one needs a rock for sexuality confusion and neither are strong enough at the early stages, which then creates the dramas. It's really good to see it portrayed so well.

First non friends role I've loved kudrow in, but Charlotte Ritchie is such a star, seen her in so many shows and every one she nails it."
Feel Good,"Intelligent, funny and real","I stumbeled upon this series and I immediatly loved it. It's engaging, intelligent, funny, feels real and spontaneous, and it tugs on your heart at all the right places. I got so engrossed in relationship between characters that I felt alongside them love, happiness, shame, fear, confusion, anxiety -the whole whirlwind, that I have a desire to watch it again just to catch all the funny puns and dialoges that went on and that I possibly missed the first time. Anyway, cheering on for season 2!"
Feel Good,Solid show,"If you like Mae Martin and want some representation, there's a good chance you'll really like this. It's quite well done - the acting and writing are solid and it tackles some deeper issues as well. I think most of the negative reviews are coming from people who had different expectations / didn't fully understand or enjoy the humor, but I thought it was hilarious and sweet."
Feel Good,I want to like it...,"I want to like this show. And I'm trying. But there are quite a few stumbling blocks in the way and I guess the biggest one is that I get zero chemistry between the two main characters. Absolutely none. And if you don't have that, you can't believe they would go through all they are going through. Beyond that I am finding the acting to often be mediocre and their rapid fire dialogue is sometimes hard to follow. I am a bit more than halfway through the episodes and while mildly intrigued where this is going and how it will end, still I am contemplating not continuing. I watch tv to be entertained and this show is just not cutting it on on several levels."
Feel Good,"Deep, Relatable, Personal","Love and addiction...or should I say love is addiction, or addiction is love. This show is just so personal. I watched all episodes in one sitting. I could relate in way of addiction, not just to drugs, but to the people we love. I recommend it to anyone looking for something real and personal to watch. I can't wait for the next season. I'm hooked."
Feel Good,I'm disappointed,"The acting was weak. None of the characters were fully built. The show pretended to be a deep one, there were so many wrong things on so many levels, that the point is just wasted. There were basically several funny moments. All of them were because of Lisa Kudrow job."
Feel Good,Not Your Typical Rom-Com,"If you're a fan of Mae Martin's stand-up (and you should be) you'll absolutely love this show.

Mae, Charlotte Ritchie (as closeted George), and Lisa Kudrow (Mae's over-bearing mother) all deliver stellar performances in this beautiful story about love, addiction, and the confusing spectrum of sexual identity we all find ourselves in.

As a bisexual person myself who has struggled with addiction, this show represented me in ways I haven't seen in years. Possibly ever.

10/10. Highly recommend."
Feel Good,I don't get it,"I've heard so many rave reviews for this show. I just don't get it. It's not funny, it's just spoilt, self-absorbed, damaged people being callous towards each other. I was really hoping this programme would be feel good as the title suggests, but it had the opposite effect. I've heard people say this programme is romantic, but I think most of the relationships are just toxic."
Feel Good,I need a season 2 already,"This show was amazing. The chemistry between Mae and George is actually amazing. I don't trust Netflix and especially not with shows that have welldone L(GBTQIA) representation, so how do I get this renewed for a following season ASAP? I already told all my friends to watch it on Netflix."
Feel Good,Started strong and then it fizzed out,"I had high hopes for this series, but it didn't deliver. First season was superior to the second where the characters got lost, no one is really likable, and there is a dose of cringe with every interaction. It's a shame as it had the potential to become something amazing."
Feel Good,Weird show - really do not get it,I have really tried to understand the humour (or lack thereof) but after falling asleep 10 times I just gave up. The main character is too weird and not relatable at all (acts like a robot).
Feel Good,"Heart felt and a really ""feel good ""show","I think it deserves 10 rating

Ps: I created an IMDb account to review this show."
Feel Good,Great writing and casting,Excellent series hope there will be a second season
Feel Good,My thoughts,"Wow. I really don't know what to say. Well let's start with the fact that this was the worst series I have watched this year.

Apparently it's a comedy as the main character is a stand-up comedian and CONSTANTLY joking. Most of the times it was okay. But it started to get annoying when even the more serious scenes had a lot of joking around. Overall I didn't like at all how the serious topics were handled. Maybe I'm just too serious but I want to see at least a bit of hard emotions when the subject matter requires them.

The acting felt forced and the cutting of the scenes didn't give much help as it was very quick and pointy if you know what I mean. Everything was happening way too fast. The reveals and hints were obvious and dropped on your face as heavily as an elephant. The interactions between the characters lacked chemistry and felt awkward most of the time.

I felt very frustrated with the characters and their decisions and actions. Some of them were so absurd that I found myself thinking that people in real life wouldn't act that way.

One thing I found good was the representation this series gives to minorities. I learned more about what everyday life feels like when you're transgender. And I have to say it started to get better towards the end of the season. It still wasn't good though..."
Feel Good,A poor woman's Fleabag,It's not terrible. It's cute. But it misses the realness to be funny.
Feel Good,A must watch,"This is the first show that has so passionately connected with me to the point where I feel I must immediately write it a review online (something I've never done before). I always feel like the shows I watch move too slow; often, I find myself fast-forwarding 10 seconds when a show starts to drag. Feel Good is a wonderful look into addiction, and its fast pace keeps me extremely engaged and accurately encapsulates the feeling of addition not only in its content but in its execution. This is a truly amazing show, and I hope there is a season two."
Feel Good,Unsure!,I really did love this show. The only issue is Mae is super annoying. I don't get it. Her mania is distracting and I can't quite figure out what she is supposed to be representing. Everything else about the show is fabulous.
Feel Good,adored this show!!,Comentario no disponible
Feel Good,"First season an interesting 7, second season a navel-gazing 5","I've liked Mae Martin for years as a random person searching for and watching her bright and quirky standup on YouTube.

The first season of this self-created series showed a bit of promise, but descended into narcissism in the second season. That may have been purposeful, but it's not fun to watch pure shallowness.

I felt little chemistry or love or even like in her so-called romantic life, and barely a single line of the stand-up scenes is funny.

Oh dear. I'll watch the third season to see if it gets slightly funnier or less self-absorbed."
Feel Good,Surprise gem,A surprise gem on Netflix. Very heartwarming and real. I really hope it get renewed!
Feel Good,"S1 good, S2 not so much","Hits all the emotional beats, but the fast pace leaves little room to be immersed in the relationship. Repetitive and stale in the second season."
Feel Good,I really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like it but not only did it seem like every indie show struggle down to the overused/cliche tinnitus-like noises and jokes that plainly fell flat. We saw what they were aiming for, they just didn't meet it and left me cringing"
Danger Force,,
Chhota Bheem Aur Krishna,Old is Gold,"I watched this movie when it came for the first time on TV screens when Chhota Bheem was only in it's developing phase, and I still enjoy it. Even if it is 16 years old, It has an excellent story and an excellent villain who is still the best villain in the entire series. Here's why it is so good:

Much before the era of crossovers, Green Gold managed to include a crossover that would go for years to come as the single best crossover of all time. The movie doesn't have unnecessary comedy as well as any plot armour. The villain has a surprisingly dark story that is really engaging and makes you dive deep into the story. The film, also gives a sense of conclusion which many films have not been able to deliever."
Chhota Bheem Aur Krishna,These people making good movies in 2008 and bollywood is on making some spicy stuff here and there,"If bollywood makes it's movies like this or better, I swear they will success some day.

Just look at the back story if the villain.

It is amazing in all aspects.

This movie is very good according to the time and the audience for which it was made.

I was just happy whenever I saw this movie on tv.

One of the best representations of Shree Krishna.

Although, there are a lot of fillers and some dubbing quality issues but a 4-5 yr old child like me didn't care to these things.

Some things are just nostalgic and the chhota bheem created nostalgia for me in Moles.

I wish they again get on making good movies.

I wish if they make a more mature version of these gems."

The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Quite enjoyable,Comentario no disponible
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Loved the first season,Loved the first season but the second season was a big letdown. The whole atmosphere of the first one was quite enjoyable and comforting.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Loved the first season! Not so much on the second season!,I loved the first season but here is my rating First season versus the second season 👍🏼👎🏻
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"First season great, second session poor","The first season was charming with great hosts and judges, and had a lovely atmosphere. Second season with a change of hosts, judges, location and format lost all the charm of the first. 9/10 for first season, 5/10 for the second."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Season 1 Classy; Season 2 Sloppy,"Although the season 1 judges could be somewhat sniffy, they created an atmosphere that encouraged good food and presentation. They stressed quality in both food and how it looked. And they didn't suffer fools. The families on season 1 were there to do their best. Season 2 presenters were more laid-back, as were the contestant families. These hosts were lacklustre and not as professional as in season one. Many of the groups in season 2 were simply annoying, fighting amongst themselves, and were poor cooks to boot. The hosts let poor food quality and presentation from families off the hook far too often. Season 2 was a big disappointment. Season 3 could be amazing."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Season 1 good Season 2 even better,Really enjoyed the first season and improved on a good thing with the second. The chefs and hosts for both seasons are good and all the families are easy to cheer for.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,10 stars for season 1,"Season one of this show is fantastic and really easy to get into. Great family dynamics and humor, the hosts are friendly and keep things moving, and it's really about the joy of families cooking together; just what everyone needs in this climate. In season 2 the whole dynamic changed. The hosts seem to mostly be there to make fun of the contestants behind their backs and it's much more geared towards, ""drama"". There's plenty of American cooking shows for that. I go to the British ones for a more relaxing, wholesome experience. I was really looking forward to season 2, but sadly don't think I'll make it through the first three episodes. Definitely worth watching for the first season though."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Lovely and homey,I'm obsessed with this show I love it from the real people to the nice judges everything was just great and it feels genuine and honest and the cooking is wonderful
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Lol,"If that Angelica wasn't part of it, it would be great. Her presence is just annoying, and her looks when someone gets something wrong. She needs a reality check. Yes she was on MC but she's not in anyway a real chef. She does not deserve to be On a show like this. Go away Angelica."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Disappointment!,"Absolutely loved Series 1, and am bitterly disappointed by the new season. Gone is everything that made the first season unique and special. Season 2 is just another cooking competition show."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Loved the Second Season,"I watched the second season first and absolutely loved it. If you're looking for a fast paced, fun, creative cooking competition, this is the show for you. Thoroughly enjoyed watching various families vie for the first place win. Although I didn't agree with the outcome, it was fascinating watching the families cook up exotic and delicious looking food, many of which I was seeing for the first time.

The first season was unwatchable for me and I stopped after the first 20 minutes."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,A Renaissance for Family Cooking,"No where else in the history of mankind can we attribute the task of cooking but, to ""Family."" We have passed down recipes for generations, perfected techniques for thousands of years and created the art of culinary adventures within the structure of socio-demographics. I appreciate that this show encompasses families of diverse backgrounds even, the eclecticism thereof. It is, without due, a British influence to home cooking however! Lol. I am most engaged watching families cook their masterpieces. There are aspects of accompanying ancestral stories that I truly believe are amiss. The evolution of Reality TV should surely find a way to document such experiences of their subjects more so in the future whereas, I think, we have too much emphasis on ""in-the-moment"" emotions as easily criticized by the audience. Nevertheless, I am elated that cooking continues to be a demand in perhaps, it's founded genre of media. Giorgio and Rosemary are a delectable judging pair panel to this series. They are both critical and comforting which makes it fun and almost suspenseful at times at the attempts to impress such experts. Their commentary is useful while bringing the home cook into the realm of professional culinary arts by way of competition. The hosts, Zoe and Nadiya are another ode to the British and their reality cooking tele. I could sense their evolving and much appreciated focus on the competitors ''stories"" more within each episode of my watching of the first season. I am rather entertained with ability to watch such international television. I love it! I love cooking and I love family! I look forward in continuing my foodie media journey with this show!"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Bring back the original format.,"I watched the first season and loved it and was excited to see season 2 was updated. I honestly was disappointed when I saw that we had new judges/hosts. I have never heard of either Judge Angelica or Tommy and found that their commentary on the meals seemed very repetitive. Also why are they showing the same recaps of the families almost every episode. I've seen the same script or dialalogue of Whites at least 3 times. We get it, you love British produce and you garden. I also liked that last season, they visited the families in their home. It's like they are trying to mimic great British bake off but with really bad producer handling it. Bottom line, judges were not likeable and just snarky."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Mmm.,"Very enjoyable show, even if everything looks too formidable to recreate. The only shortcoming is the racism."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Contestants' lack of skill or smarts is biggest problem,"I liked the show format of Season 1 better than Season 2, but I liked the two hosts/judges better in Season 2 than the 2 hosts/2 judges in Season 1.

My biggest problem with this show is just the frequent stupidity of the contestants -- or their lack of skills. I'm sick of seeing contestants who decide to completely disregard the recipe when they are cooking something they have never made before, only to completely screw it up. (D'uh, what did you expect? That you, who had never made something before, could improve on the tried & true recipe that the judges gave you?!)

Also, sometimes the contestants would make something they had never made before in the part of the competition that they were supposed to have practiced ahead of time! Why come on the show if you can't even practice your dish before being on national television?

I am not a great cook or a great baker but I do all right. I have seen a lot of really basic mistakes that even I know better than to make, so why are some of these people on a national cooking competition?!!

(Note: I am a big fan of The Great British Baking Show, which has a great format, but also has a lot of really talented bakers. If this show was trying to create another winner like the GBBS, they really failed!)"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Love the show,The show is amazing!!! The only disappointment is that one person (contestant) that doesn't really work well with their group (family). My belief is everyone should be able to share ideas without being chastised or treated like a underling.
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Different season 1 and season 2 but have their own shtick,Comentario no disponible
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Loved this show. Bring it back!!!!,"I just happened upon this cooking show and I loved it! I REALLY enjoyed the hosts Tommy Banks and Angelica Bell. It was a different type of show and I loved It! Low key, supportive hosts, and interesting families with their ideas.

I'm so disappointed it was cancelled. PLEASE bring it back with these specific hosts.

Great new concept for a cooking show!"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Second season not as good as the first,"Liked the first season, but second season judge continued to put one family through though they did not do as well as other families. Definitely think Tom should go. He was not voting for what the families cooked but who he wanted to win."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Cooking showdown during pandemic lockdown,"I loved watching this UK series here in the States. And, like some of the negative reviews for the 2nd season...well...I understand some of the criticisms. However, I'm so glad that there were 2 seasons! Watching people interact and create and being together as (partial) families just really helped me get through my own extreme isolation many nights. I wish there were more seasons of this show. Cooking shows aren't my typical genre, but I've started to fall in love with them over the past couple of years...and now especially during this very stressful time. I'm explaining all of this, because, at the end of the day...there are worse things than a ""so so"" 2nd season. Yes, I preferred season 1. But, I very gladly kept going thru season 2. Keep an open mind, stay safe, and have fun watching families stress out over their gravies and sides, etc.!"
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Was a good show, now they've changed the format...",Comentario no disponible
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Season 2 is a total disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of this show. The presenters and judges were excellent and the structure of the show was exciting and different. I loved that one of the challenges took the families and judges to their own homes. The new season has a totally different format and it might as well now be ""Chopped: Family Edition"". I've only watched two episodes of the new season and I may not bother to finish the series.

I give the first season a solid 8 and the new season a 1. Netflix, you screwed this one up big time."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,"Loved Season 1, Hated Season 2.","Whoever is responsible for changing the hosts/judges, should be fired together with Tommy Banks and Angellica Bell. This second season was a great let down. If there is a third season, revert back to almost everything in Season 1, especially Nadiya Hussain."
The Big Family Cooking Showdown,Downhill...,I'm three episodes into the second season and I think I'm going to pass on the rest. I enjoyed watching the home cooks in the first season however these current ones seem to be in it more for a laugh then bringing real talent to the table. A let down!

Cowboy Bebop,Quite enjoyable,Comentario no disponible
Cowboy Bebop,Loved the first season,Loved the first season but the second season was a big letdown. The whole atmosphere of the first one was quite enjoyable and comforting.
Cowboy Bebop,Loved the first season! Not so much on the second season!,I loved the first season but here is my rating First season versus the second season 👍🏼👎🏻
Cowboy Bebop,"First season great, second session poor","The first season was charming with great hosts and judges, and had a lovely atmosphere. Second season with a change of hosts, judges, location and format lost all the charm of the first. 9/10 for first season, 5/10 for the second."
Cowboy Bebop,Season 1 Classy; Season 2 Sloppy,"Although the season 1 judges could be somewhat sniffy, they created an atmosphere that encouraged good food and presentation. They stressed quality in both food and how it looked. And they didn't suffer fools. The families on season 1 were there to do their best. Season 2 presenters were more laid-back, as were the contestant families. These hosts were lacklustre and not as professional as in season one. Many of the groups in season 2 were simply annoying, fighting amongst themselves, and were poor cooks to boot. The hosts let poor food quality and presentation from families off the hook far too often. Season 2 was a big disappointment. Season 3 could be amazing."
Cowboy Bebop,Season 1 good Season 2 even better,Really enjoyed the first season and improved on a good thing with the second. The chefs and hosts for both seasons are good and all the families are easy to cheer for.
Cowboy Bebop,10 stars for season 1,"Season one of this show is fantastic and really easy to get into. Great family dynamics and humor, the hosts are friendly and keep things moving, and it's really about the joy of families cooking together; just what everyone needs in this climate. In season 2 the whole dynamic changed. The hosts seem to mostly be there to make fun of the contestants behind their backs and it's much more geared towards, ""drama"". There's plenty of American cooking shows for that. I go to the British ones for a more relaxing, wholesome experience. I was really looking forward to season 2, but sadly don't think I'll make it through the first three episodes. Definitely worth watching for the first season though."
Cowboy Bebop,Lovely and homey,I'm obsessed with this show I love it from the real people to the nice judges everything was just great and it feels genuine and honest and the cooking is wonderful
Cowboy Bebop,Lol,"If that Angelica wasn't part of it, it would be great. Her presence is just annoying, and her looks when someone gets something wrong. She needs a reality check. Yes she was on MC but she's not in anyway a real chef. She does not deserve to be On a show like this. Go away Angelica."
Cowboy Bebop,Disappointment!,"Absolutely loved Series 1, and am bitterly disappointed by the new season. Gone is everything that made the first season unique and special. Season 2 is just another cooking competition show."
Cowboy Bebop,Loved the Second Season,"I watched the second season first and absolutely loved it. If you're looking for a fast paced, fun, creative cooking competition, this is the show for you. Thoroughly enjoyed watching various families vie for the first place win. Although I didn't agree with the outcome, it was fascinating watching the families cook up exotic and delicious looking food, many of which I was seeing for the first time.

The first season was unwatchable for me and I stopped after the first 20 minutes."
Cowboy Bebop,A Renaissance for Family Cooking,"No where else in the history of mankind can we attribute the task of cooking but, to ""Family."" We have passed down recipes for generations, perfected techniques for thousands of years and created the art of culinary adventures within the structure of socio-demographics. I appreciate that this show encompasses families of diverse backgrounds even, the eclecticism thereof. It is, without due, a British influence to home cooking however! Lol.

Neo Yokio,Jaden Smiths finest hour,A smart and funny caricatcher of modern life played out with a great voice cast including Jaden Smith who voiced his part of a spoild brat perfectly and The Kid Mero and Desus Nice who's every other line was delivered hilariously. Definitely worth your time if you are either a fan of anime or dry humour.
Neo Yokio,Remember to bring a big toblerone to read all these 1 star reviews,"It's understandable that a lot of people didn't get what this show was trying to be and voted 1. Yes the animation wasn't the best, yes the voice acting was equally not the best.

If you grew with animes in the 80s and 90s, it's likely that you will get at least some of the tropes and references this show is making fun of. And speaking of references, it's full of them. Some of the more obvious being from Ranma ½ and Sailor Moon. Toss in a mockery of Taylor swift and Ralph Lauren, and you're set. It manages to be a parody without losing its own identity.

I don't think it's for everyone, but I had a blast with it and I hope there will be more of it.

Now let me go enjoy my big toblerone."
Neo Yokio,Recommended anime comedy,"This is a fun and original show, not at all what I expected actually. The main character is a melodramatic douche and it's animated so you don't have to see his face, in many ways this is the role Jaden Smith was born to play. The voice acting and animation is not stellar but I recommend it completely unironically. This is just a fresh and fun show, better than most comedy anime."
Neo Yokio,Culture Clash,"With obvious anime roots, this show is a western version of an eastern style that often tries to emulate western values and iconography. As such you get a uniquely self-referential style of series that simultaneously celebrates western aristocratic capitalism, while at the same time questioning it.

There is a distinct American Psycho vibe, where class, stature and the latest accessories often take precedence over sane character choices and are emphasised throughout as the be-all and end-all of the constructed world of Neo Yokio. While there is often humour derived from these situations the show also seems to be trying to make some real points about materialism and shallow social climbing. The problem is that all these points have been made a thousand times before, and they overshadow any 'demonic' goings-on, which are really just background noise to the social politics of the world created.

Overall Neo Yokio has its own style for a western show, and is a decent watch. It is mostly a shame that it only has a six-episode first series since none of the themes are explored anywhere near enough. With some more time this could have been a cult hit, as it is it requires a lot more expansion since nothing really happens in the six episode span past scratching the surface of the world."
Neo Yokio,"I had no expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised","I legitimately had no idea what to expect. I was just thumbing through Netflix and came across this on their recently added. Neo Yokio is very, VERY different from anything else you have seen, and it is important to keep this in mind while watching it.

It feels like Wes Anderson, the anime, so there is very little precedent for the show in general. The show keeps the mood light and rarely takes itself or its characters seriously. Don't try to take it seriously, but instead focus on the comically unfitting soundtrack, the deadpan delivery of ridiculous lines, and the hilarious commentary on how out of touch the social elite can be. 6 episodes is by no means an investment, and you may enjoy it!"
Neo Yokio,"Not garbage, but not anything special. Watchable.","I have an inherent negative disposition to Jaden Smith, as if you listen to the things that come out of his mouth that aren't scripted, you'll usually end up finding your face in your palm, but fortunately I didn't know that his was the voice that I was listening to until I finished the series and went to rate it. Overall this wasn't anything special as an ""anime"" if you can call it that (which I think you can), as I view anime as a medium for telling a story, not some specific set of rules that an show must fall into, to meet the spectacular term we call anime.

In regards to the story, I didn't feel like it was a ""One Punch Man"" ripoff at all, it was most definitely it's own thing! The plot doesn't revolve around the protagonist having too much power, so much so that he's driven to boredom. This show however was definitely very interesting, to see what a fully americanized anime looks like. This is it, and for that reason alone I'd recommend giving it a watch, but if you're a man or woman with very limited time who doesn't get to watch much TV / anime, I'd advise you to probably not put this one at the top of your list. All in all it was a fun and watchable anime, just for the different American feel it gives, and seeing the generation Z slang in an anime. If you have nothing better to do, it's a quick fun watch, by no means is it the best, but definitely watchable.

Only peev with the show is that the girl's voices were almost all, strangely, very deep... Besides this it a very watchable 7/10 full blown ""hip"" American anime.

edit- Another user put it perfectly: ""Western anime that's not actually trying to mimic eastern anime"" which is quite a unique thing, that we really don't get to see much of, so that's why I recommend a watch :)"
Neo Yokio,The voice acting and character development is almost as bad as the animation,"I was initially excited to see a new anime on netflix and even more so excited to see that it was in English. But after only two episodes, I was more annoyed and furious about this anime simply existing. The concept behind the plot is vague and unfortunately abstract. With a veiled reference to what seems to be modern New York, but set in a futuristic time line.

The animation was absolute garbage. It was very reminiscent of the mockery pokemon anime South Park did or the very accurate insults Robot Chicken portrayed of Speed Racer. Each scene only moved the lips and eyes as needed, everything else was animated as little as necessary.

In summation, the animation is pathetic, voice action is repulsive, and the story plot and character development is amateur at best. When I found out that Jaden Smith was the lead character in this train wreck, it only seemed to pull together all the strings of this disaster.

My final recommendation: AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!"
Neo Yokio,"Love it or hate it, I really enjoyed the campy style","I really enjoyed the campy-Zoolander-style of this show. If you're in the mood for a funny lighthearted show that doesn't take itself too seriously this is a great watch. It has been called pretentious, but the pretentiousness (or lack of true pretentiousness) is the reason it is funny. It doesn't take itself seriously. It knows its characters are ridiculous and that's part of the fun. If you love and prefer violent horror anime like Ajin you're probably not going to like it. A lot of anime lovers complained about it, but I found it refreshingly funny compared to the overly serious and excessively violent anime that I have seen lately. If you liked Zoolander you will probably like this show. I had to give it an 8 out of 10 since the actual animation is not that great, but in a way, the animation reflects its lack of seriousness. I watched it for the comedy and the story. It's not perfect, but it is good. It's something new and original and it made me smile. If you want it to be serious you're missing the fun."
Neo Yokio,Not bad but it really could be better,"The show has the right idea for a Western Cartoon very obviously inspired by anime.

But for me my main problems with the show stem from the lifeless feel of some of the voice acting and maybe the not so well matched up voice acting with certain characters. Jaden isn't bad but I feel with a little more effort and life added to his acting as his character, would make his character Kaz seem more engaged with the plot that's going on in the cartoon. Also the actress for Helena could use a bit more life to her character's role as well because she just sounded too disinterested most of the time.

Then there's the actors who play Gottlieb and Lexy actually do kind of well with the voice acting, the actress for Aunt Agatha who does well with the voice acting and feels well suited, Charles' actor feels well suited, and even the actor who plays Arcangelo seems well suited for his role.

But even some decent voice acting can only take you so far with your characters. Sometimes they feel a bit 2 dimensional but there's definitely room for development.

That's some of my small gripes with the voice acting and characters now to the plot.

It feels like something I've kind of seen in anime, but just add all these different things about the futuristic city, fashion, and popularity (Hierarchies) that Gen Z kids are really into with it. I mean if the story decided to expand more with the main plot instead of focusing so much on the fashion and popularity stuff maybe it wouldn't feel a bit underwhelming for me.

Don't get me wrong I like the show, but really I can tell there is room for improvement. And because it has only 6 episodes so far, so there's maybe a chance of improvement occurring during the show's future production.

And if you enjoyed the show that's good for you!! I just hope my review was somewhat helpful!! Thanks for reading!! ^_^"
Neo Yokio,It's Jaden Smith The Anime,"The absolute worst Netflix Original by far. Me and my friends are huge fans of Jaden Smith's pretentious garbage, and this is pure Jaden Smith Twitter levels of that. Must see for fellow lovers of garbage."
Neo Yokio,A Masterpiece,"From story, to animation, to voice acting this piece is incredible. A true meme treasure chest, Jaden Smith deserves all the Big Toblerones in the world for his performance. The only disappointing part is that it's only 6 episodes long, the story and world deserves more time than this. Netflix should halt all production on other shows to focus on this."
Neo Yokio,Has potential.,"It's not the worst thing ever, but it's not the greatest either. Honestly, I understand everyone's opinions on the show, and I completely agree with most aspects of them. However, this show has much more potential than people think. This could not only have been a good parody, but if they decide to, we might actually get a good plot sometime in the future. I know people might not agree with my opinion,but this show has the potential to be something that's at least decent. It's a shame the first season wasted most of it though."
Neo Yokio,Neo Yokio is a terrible parody of anime that I just couldn't sit through,"Neo Yokio is an anime parody, except the jokes aren't funny, and even if the lines themselves are well-written, the delivery and directing ultimately kill the joke.

First, I'll get the easiest weakness out of the way. The animation and design of this show is terrible. At first, the animation seemed poor, but not outright bad. After a while though, it become unbelievably cheap that I'm shocked if it even had a budget. While animation in normal, serious anime can be just as lazy in some places, they at least have the benefit of their key-frames being visually appealing, which is not the case for Neo Yokio. The poor animation in some anime is meant so they can spend more on action and fight scenes, where as in Neo Yokio, the show is consistently terrible with its animation.

The voice acting is terrible, which is especially weird considering that so much of the shows cast are incredibly talented people, such as Jude Law and Steve Buscemi. The poor delivery of the dialogue ruins many of the jokes, and makes it incredibly obnoxious to sit through.

The show tries to be a comedy, but I didn't even realize that they were even telling jokes until halfway through. All of the jokes are delivered as if they were normal dialogue, and go unnoticed by the viewer. It's clear that the joke is that the show isn't as interesting or deep as it's appears to be, but the joke gets old, and because of the terrible directing, none of the other jokes hit, except for minor exceptions.

I know what some people might be saying ""Neo Yokio is trying to be bad, so that makes it okay!"", but no, that's just incorrect. It might make me less harsh on those involved, but it doesn't mean the show is any better, it just means they were self-aware.

The best way to enjoy Neo Yokio, is to not take it seriously, and keep your expectations as low as you can. However, in my own opinion, Neo Yokio is something I won't ever watch again."
Neo Yokio,I hate Jayden Smith,"I never realised before how much I hate Jayden Smith. The fact that I never watch anything with him in it must have been why. I don't like everything WILL Smith does, but, he is a great actor. He is cool, funny and charismatic. His son clearly is not. Jaydn's voice acting is terrible. He sounds so bored the entire time. The show looks great. Anime usually does. It has some nice classical music. The main problem is that the main character is so unlikable I find myself rooting against him. In Death Note the main character does some terrible things, but, I still root for him, because, he is written and performed so well. This is just pretentious anime for the sake of making anime, because, it is in fashion now. There is also tons of SJW propaganda in it if you are paying attention. Don't let this put you off anime. Some of it is actually good. This is politically correct hipster cartoon trash."
Neo Yokio,"Solid Cast, Intriguing Animation, and Lots of Potential","Neo Yokio is a real treat to sit through! I'm pretty picky when it comes to anime/anime offshots and hardly ever watch the genre, but I decided to check this out on a friend's recommendation (plus the fact Ezra Koenig is a wildly talented dude and I was interested to see his foray into television).

Main character Kaz, voiced by Jaden Smith (who's easily the weakest voice actor in the cast but charming enough), is a Shakespeare-esque protagonist, constantly mourning his bourgeois social standing and heartbreak in writing so ironic and hilariously pretentious (in a good way) it feels like a cartoon designed by Wes Anderson. The supporting cast is equally memorable, especially Kaz's robot butler voiced by Jude Law, his rival Archangelo voiced by Jason Schwartzman, and friends Lexy and Gottlieb donned by comedy duo Desus and Mero. You also have solid characters from Steve Buscemi, Susan Sarandon, and Tavi Gevinson.

The plot line is punchy and entirely paradoxical in nature, balancing Kaz's high-society lifestyle of field hockey, expensive shopping, and brunch, with bouts of Formula 1 Racing, demon-hunting, and the undercurrents of a Marxist revolution.

I think most people finding fault in the show have more of an issue with the relatively new-to-voice acting cast and unconventional, borderline mockery of anime tropes. But if you're not a die-hard anime fan like myself, and want to enjoy a hilariously written and totally unpredictable show with both an adult and Saturday-morning cartoon feel, check it out. I'm crossing my fingers for a Season 2!"
Neo Yokio,Interesting Start To A Show I Hope To See More Of,"Critics are being far too harsh on this show this show reminds me of shows like golden boy or flcl it's weird, strange, kirky and odd not to mention hilarious and it knows what it is from the first episode. Im what most would consider a hard core anime fan and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Kaz isn't the most likable main character at first but his character development is definitely there i thought the ending to the first season was a smart move although it was a little odd it did feel it stayed true to the shows overall feeling. I'm interested to see how Kaz develops in future seasons."
Neo Yokio,if you want action don't watch it,"The animation is good but the main caracter is boring as the story. If you want good anime, watch cowboy bebop and skip this"
Neo Yokio,"If Jaden Smith is in it, you know it's bad","Anti capitalists complain in a show that only exists because of

Will Smith's fame everyone paying for their crappy Netflix subscription"
Neo Yokio,Genius Show!!!,"Neo Yokio is so good because it manages to perfectly balance satire (both making fun of high-society capitalists and playing homage to anime of the 90s) and a serious message of questioning the system in which you reside.

The point that Neo Yokio is making is an anti-capitalist one. This is made most obvious in the last episode with Kaz's own revelation, but is evident from the beginning in the complete ridiculousness of these rich kids and how they care so much more about clothes and drinks than the very real problems happening around them, the so-called ""demons"" specifically attacking the rich in order to demolish high society (including the obvious reference to McCarthyism with the fear of ""demon sympathizers""), and the very obvious lessons against selfishness and using others as a means to your own ends. The main serious moments of the show (""I feel no synergy"" being one of my favorites) come during moments of disillusionment; when Kaz is losing his faith in the society of elegance he worships.

(Gonna take a moment here to say that these are all good things the show is doing. Capitalism is bad. Just thought I'd put that out there in case any stupid idiots are reading this and think that I'm making any sort of criticism.)

In contrast, part of the humor comes from mocking that very society and the way people uncritical of it act (placing so much importance on fashion and useless competition, trying to hard to be intellectuals but just coming off as dumb and pretentious); the main characters are fundamentally unlikable because they buy so much into the society from which they come. Even Helena in her rebellion against capitalist society is mostly ineffective outside her own circles because she can only see the world from the point of view of the extremely wealthy. It doesn't matter that they're unlikable, though, because they're absolutely hilarious. It's part of the charm. But most of the charm comes from the overall aesthetic directly referencing Saturday morning cartoons.

Look: If you were born in the late 90s and your parents couldn't afford cable, you grew up watching shitty 4Kids dubs of YuGiOh and Dragonball. Everything about the quality of Neo Yokio is reminiscent of the Americanized anime of my childhood. Bad dialogue and voice acting, the most basic communication of the original plot and concepts, poor lip syncing from the original Japanese to English, even things like onigiri being called ""snacks"" (or ""jelly donuts""-- thanks, Pokemon) are part of Neo Yokio. The joke, of course, is that there is no ""original"" to butcher-- the failing philosophy undergrad dialogue, the over/under acting, the cultural disconnect-- are all how the show was meant to be. And that's hilarious! It's f*cking amazing! It's ultimate form is to be a parody of itself, and it's honestly incredible.

I would highly recommend this show to anyone who grew up watching 4kids, have a sense of humor, and/or can understand when people are mocking the capitalist system."
Neo Yokio,Fun,This show so so funny and great. I love the characters
Neo Yokio,This is so pretentious it hurts,"Let me just say I made a pointed effort to try to go into this open minded and was almost immediately disappointed. The whole thing is a weird attempt at both mocking and glorifying classic anime tropes, only done so with no real purpose. It's like it's trying to hide the fact it doesn't know what it's doing behind an ""artistic"" facade that's about as flimsy as Jaden Smiths unfathomably flat voice acting.

This whole thing just sways from pointless whining to incredibly contrived conflicts to just long swaths of pseudo-intellectual mumbling. It's just awful, clearly whoever wrote and directed this was given far FAR too much creative control and there was no one to reign them in cause almost every moment of this show just seems off. In addition this really does have no soul, no point, no gravitas no nothing really, it's literally just a self indulgent foray into anime for the sake of well... I don't know why.

Take away, it's bad, very bad. It tries to be a lot of things and fails to be anything other than incredibly whiny (mostly about the burdens of being rich), about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face and just kind of annoying."
Neo Yokio,Snacks are ready.,"Objectively, this show is terrible. It has bad animation, poor voice acting, a nonsensical story, and little character development. If you're looking for something interesting to take seriously, then you're not going to enjoy this.

However, if you spend a lot of time on the internet and enjoy memes and parody series, then you are going to love this. Its so bizarre and nonsensical that it becomes the ultimate meme."
Neo Yokio,First anime-like series I've watched and I must say I really enjoyed it,First anime-like series I've watched and I must say I really enjoyed it
Neo Yokio,Easily the worst thing I've seen all year.,"Remember when you were 14 and into Sherlock holmes / Agatha Christie / James bond / Anything at all high brow and British?

Whatever self indulgent, pretentious, Mr. Perfect let me cram all the cool tropes into this one guy you came up at that age is this show.

The dialogue is beyond badly written. The voice acting is dead and the character's animation is lifeless to match. To make it worse there is no point to the show other than name drop things you might know (Mostly Brands) to show how above it they are...

A part of me thinks this is parody but I'm not sure of what. The show is too pointless and aimless. It also plays into the tropes rather than do something with it.

Don't waste your time. This is what's lurking at the bottom of netflix's barrel. Leave it there."

The Light in Your Eyes,,
Marseille,Not as bad as french people say,"Though I'm not french I've been living in France for almost 10 years and I speak french. I think I can understand why french people is hating this series. I presume they're looking into details that non- french speakers won't take notice: accents, way of acting, rhythm, dialogues, etc. The french viewers and filmmakers are used to other kind of stories and language (in addition, french people love to take down their own work! You won't never hear them saying ""this is good"", they will say ""it's not bad/c'est pas mal"")

The series is worth the watch. There's an evolution in the characters that might have been done better, but acting and script it's not as bad as critics have said. Not the best series I'll see this year, but I've loved it as it radically changed from most of the other options you have on Netflix: American or British productions.

I hope there'll be a 2nd season."
Marseille,Not deserved the hate,"For a French series, I think it's a good beginning to a new era, it will open others ways to explore for the ""french series industry"" (yes by Netflix this time).

About the series it-self, it's quiet good, the script, trivia, camera shoots are good. Sometimes the dialogues are ""weird"" and I think even more when you understand French. About the actors, Magimel is good in this role and Depardieu is quite eaten by his past, we know almost everything about his films and there is no surprise about his playing. But all together have a sort of charm in the Frenchie way.

So I'll wait for the season 2."
Marseille,English translation,"Great show. Triste pour la France. If the writers/producers or the people in charge of the translation are reading, please contact me. I would very much enjoy giving your translators French lessons. This show is urban. This show is social. It is also very political. Proper translation is in order to convey the message and honor the writers. Too often do we see TV shows suffer from poor conduit. It has nothing to do with opinions on any of the subjects displayed in the show itself. Simply to honor both languages. The cultural effect might suffer. the slangs, idioms, and social language is quite simple to fix. Language carry the weight of social and cultural change."
Marseille,Boring stereotypes,"The script is born to mimic other political scripts. And be fateful to the nanny state state school indoctrination. Nothing original. Or creative. Stock characters in a stock story. The acting is so and so. The dialogue is crap. So it's hard to blame the actors. And the writers and producers are so in need of information! It is the French white middle class view on both the very low and the very high placed people in their society. A fairy tale about life in the ghetto or the political games. Probably a series about catholic syndicate men (not women), say the railway or the teachers, extorting more money from the rest of the society would have turned out far more engaging.

Marseille,A lot of smoking,"Too much smoking... storyline like a soap opera, hard to watch sometimes, nice scenic shots of the city"
Marseille,I lived these Series,"As an American of European descent I loved these series. All lead actors put out great performances. Depardieu didn't disappoint. May be french audience is giving it poor ratings, but as someone who doesn't speak or understands French, I loved it. I always watch foreign movies, including this one, in original language with English subtitles. I also loved Borgen, the Danish political drama series. Well done, both Marseille and Borgen."
Marseille,Stiff collars,Once I get my head around why actors keep tugging at their collars over and over again then maybe I can pay attention to the content
Marseille,I love this series,"Up here in Vancouver we don't have teeming masses of third world immigrants living in Ghettos. We don't have ""projects"" and while we do have our social problems they are flyswatted away in comparison to the major European Cities (and the major American cities I might add). Toronto is getting there though!

This series for me highlights a number of differences between the European zeitgeist and our way of living. It's principally about election skulduggery but it's full of real social comment. No gay issues, no transgender whining and a different , more subtle, intelligent feminism. In short, no political correctness to be found.

First thing is the overpowering sense of hopelessness for the working class stiff or the immigrant, there's just no chance of getting ahead in the normal run of things. If you're born in the projects then there's no way out, unless you get lucky or turn to crime. The education system can't really help you because it's as broken as the rest of the social infrastructure. That broken infrastructure is one of the most powerful themes in the storyline

The answer in history has been revolution, but there's so many disparate interests in these cities/countries that we just have to wait for the true revolutionary to surface ( and they only come once in every few generations)

The second difference is in the embedded class system , everything on the one side is haute couture, gourmet dining and love of the arts while on the other side the untermensch get fast food , hiphop and drugs.

Can you see trouble coming?

This series portrays it all wonderfully well and the casting is superb. Depardieu is a fantastic talent and all the actors around him are flawless. The upper class women have that aura of elegance and privilege about them and the rebellious youthful cast are so intellectual in their portrayals that you know that they've been in this treacherous scenario at some time in their lives already.

Politicians are politicians no matter what country you're in, but these reach another level of sleaze with their greed and hunger for sexual conquests. Each and every actor puts on a perfect performance .

Sex is just another day in the park for these European productions and so we see quite a bit of it. It's just another tool to gain power or compromise somebody's integrity. As an aside , one French President, when confronted with the scandal of his illegitimate child, said "" So What?""

Marseille is painted as a dirty, slum filled port city riddled with crime and corruption... funny, but that was the impression I got when I visited the place a couple of years ago. See? you can judge a book by its cover.

Fantastic series but don't listen to the English dubbing, it is atrocious just like most of the other foreign language movies that Netflix butchers. Just keep it to the subtitles and you'll enjoy it

Netflix really should be brought to task about their overdubbing, I've seen three or four movies now where it's been done and it couldn't be any worse!"
Marseille,Not as good as it could be,"SE você quer uma série para praticar o francês e ver lindas paisagens do Sul da França com direito a Gerard Depardieu essa é a pedida. Mas, se procura uma série bem produzida com roteiro bacana, esquece. SI vous voulez une série pour pratiquer le français et voir de beaux paysages du sud de la France avec Gérard Depardieu c'est le truc. Mais si vous recherchez une série bien produite avec un script sympa, oubliez-la. IF you want a series to practice French and see beautiful landscapes of the South of France with Gerard Depardieu this is the thing. But, if you're looking for a well-produced series with a cool script, forget it.#netflix #serieslover #marseille"
Marseille,High hopes end in disappointment,"After House of Cards I hoped to enjoy a similar show in European setting this time. Depardieu with all the cast perform very well, but the script in general is rather flat. The behavior of major protagonists is illogical at times as if Netflix was very much in a hurry to release season one in 2016.

It would have been a very decent season if the script writers had studied better the psychological side of main protagonists.

Wrapping up: music is great, photo shooting pleasant to watch, location also fantastic, nonetheless it is far from West Wing or House of Cards milieu."
Marseille,I love the actors,Gerard Depardieu played his role so good..you can tell he's a veteran actor..as well he made nice duo with Benoit Magimel ( Lucas Barres ) The series is entertaining and not boring at all.. I am sure if Netflix continue the series it will work out especially that they learned a lot from season 1 and 2
Marseille,"I say I say ,Marseille","Well after watching SPIRAL the TV series, Marseille does contain a couple of actors from SPIRAL, but this is a little disappointing. Finished 1st series, maybe it will get better. The scenery is beautiful especially the port area. Gerard plays his part well, Benoit is a character I thought would have been better allocated to someone else. He was a little unbelievable at times, as was the wife of the Maire.

Take your time with it if you want to understand the plot and the characters. Some characters are definately there to fill spaces and are not really integral to the plots, of which there are a few twists.

Enjoy."
Marseille,Netflix made better series.,"Just finished (binge)watching Marseille. It's an old fashioned but well made series with a simple straight forward storyline without any sidelines. There are some sex scenes but nothing explicit and they all serve the story (read one review that stated the series was oozing sex but that is nonsense). It's mostly about betrayal and changing loyalties in a small group of people centred around a mayor election in Marseille. The plot is very predictable and does not have surprises, you can see developments coming long before they happen. For a 8 part series the cast is very limited but good, acting is OK but in several parts I was not impressed. It's a Netflix series that will not win any prizes, they made better. Marseille is an interesting town, full of contradictions and a boiling pot full of crime and problems on one hand and promise onthe other side. Have the feeling there was more to be made out of this."
Marseille,I'd call it a masterpiece,"Sure I'll start with how Gerard Depardieu plays his role because it really is outstanding. But actually all the others are as well because there is a multitude of characters, all perfect selection and well played. The show is just how a good idea should go - few seasons, few episodes, as otherwise everything, no matter how good, starts to degrade - happened to many TV show, even that here there is an open end in a way that allows a good 3rd season, but is as good as it is even without it.

The plot might start as a rather classical politics fight, but twists in an interesting way thanks to all the dirt in the politics, plus the unexpected things in life.

Great camera work, as scenes and light are top. Good soundtrack."
Marseille,"Decent, but...","One of the few things I'd like to mention is that overall the show is pretty decent in terms of style, plot and acting. However, some actors seem to be not in the right place. The actress playing Rachel Taro is clearly overacting, she's boring, dull, and simply not believable. The actress who plays Vanessa is utterly James-Bond-villian-type-two-dimensional and looks like she's about to break into a spaceship. There's also one thing that really pisses me off. Those times when somebody sends a text message and their photos appear... My God... They're so cheesy and unrealistic and you feel like you're playing a video game."
Marseille,Entertaining series with Depardieu,"Not really a great entertaining series but enough good to spend a lovely and interesting time with all the characters shown in these Netflix episodes.

Every actor and especially Gerard Depardieu delivered performance as I expected.

The content is mixed with corruption, scandals, criminal and love affairs that maintains the attention above the average. Marseille is the heart in this story and the running time of each part is not too long. So if you have not other options on Netflix for example try these French series. You will see it is never boring but be warned not to expect too much. My rating with my wife is an average of 6 out 10."
Marseille,Love this show,Love this show. Gerard Depardieu is brilliant! Please make more series!
Marseille,Dynasty meets House of Cards,"Merely better than average, this confection is a spiritual heir to House of Cards. In more ways than one, considering recent revelations of me-too allegations against its venerable leading man. We are watching because we are in the country for a while, and have learned interesting things, such as that the titular town is the nation's second city, but second to none in its regard for colofrul fashion. Fans of the old American show Dynasty will perhaps appreciate certain parallels to that project, as well. You may learn nothing more profound than certain phrases, for example that when the French wish to call a spade a spade, they call it 'un chat'. A melodrama has the same purposes in all languages, one supposes. Lasts no longer than the two seasons that it deserves."
Marseille,Twisting drama about mayor of Marseille,"Firstly I recommend you set to french language and use English subtitles, it is much better hearing the actual actor's voices. The characters are good and surprised me at the changes in what you think will happen, shows politics how it is with deals, treachery and affairs. I found the series captivating. I know many French critics didn't like the series and seems two seasons is the lot but for me looking into this world it was entertaining and shocking and I would have liked to see 4 seasons to focus on individuals progress or downfall. Give it a go."
Marseille,B quality with splendid backdrop,"Marseille, well the dialogue or script sound like some cheap french soap opera, the scenery though is fantastic, views of the city are what kept me watching this jumbled up mess of a soap opera. Excessive reliance on sex scenes seem almost clichéd, whose screwing who, got to keep track of all of that useless drivel, scriptwriters should of got on with developing some proper dialogue and in depth characterization. The characters all come across as clichéd and tiresome, dreary dreary, but the panorama shots of the city do look so good. The marvelous french architecture and historic city buildings are interesting backdrops to all of this. It is supposed to be quite the crime infested city, and I guess that is real to a point, but I wish they could have given the characters more dimension, and stop with the excessive useless tiresome overdone sex scenes."
Marseille,Top series in 2016 definitely,"Very exciting series, with much to look forward to.

Each episode was more exciting than the other.

Looking forward to next season , and what it has to offer.

Think this series just gets better and better.

Finally some series in French and not just English .

The main character is so good. He makes the series.

One of the top series 2016, guaranteed.

One of the best series I've seen in a long time .

So good characters in it, and it will come only more and more .

I love this, series.

Regards: Saoobi"
Marseille,A B-class political drama in an exciting environment,"This was supposed to be a French version of something like House of Cards. It is about the rivalry between two candidates for the political leadership in Marseille. Both Gérard Depardieu and Benoit Magimel are two good, and very different, actors for the main characters. This creates an interesting dynamic between the two.

Still, the drama feels quite flat and stereotype in its execution. Actors are overplaying at the expense of nuances, subtleties and leaving basically nothing left to the imagination of the viewer. The storyline feels very linear and predictable, there are too few twists that keeps the interest up. Also it seems like very boring politically correct approach where the good folks always are on the left side and the bad ones always on the right side of politics.

The series could have been so much more than it was. A pity with so strong casting.

No surprise that it was cancelled after two seasons."
Marseille,Oedipus Rex (spoilers),Comentario no disponible
Marseille,Depardieu masterful,"Many of the reviews of this series are critical primarily because of its soap-opera tendencies and the fact that some plot lines are either poorly developed or absurd. True in many respects. However in my opinion the whole far outweighs the sum of the parts and the overall impression and effect is powerful. This is because Depardieu carries it via his total authenticity as the patriarchal but ageing old-style political leader who is desperately hanging on on the one hand, but whose instincts and humanity capture our sympathy and support in spite of his flaws. In art as in life as far as GP is concerned?! In particular the positioning of ""Sporting Marseille"" (OM) as a unifying civic force is spot on, as it is for many big and discordant Old World cities. The portrayal of the extreme right ""Parti Francais"" has evidently (from some reviews) angered certain sections of society but it is on the mark. Not a bad effort from Netflix, and superb from Depardieu."
Message from the King,"When it hits, it hits... but sometimes it misses","Ooh boy, here's a toughie.

Chadwick Boseman, we barely knew ye. Two seconds after you broke onto the A List, you left us all in shock when you departed this world, the consensus being that it was well before your time. While arguments can be made one way or the other about such things, one thing is certain:

You made an impact.

MESSAGE FROM THE KING is not the best movie I have ever seen, unfortunately. It has pacing issues, continuity problems, and questionable dialogue choices. All that being said, Chadwick steals every scene with his powerful performance, and at least that's worth something.

It's not all bad. A man from South Africa comes to Los Angeles, searching for what happened to his missing sister. Without spoiling too much of the film, he finds out, and then wants to settle scores for what has happened.

In an attempt to create an original plot, some things get lost. There is a scent of mystery here, well played by the creators... we don't know who Jacob King is, or WHAT he is, beyond being a loving sibling who's well beyond furious as to the events as they unfold, and that part of the film works fine. In an effort to keep the mystery going, we are given a seedy, not terribly friendly portrait of Los Angeles life, and the downfalls some who go looking for dreams fall into.

Teresa Palmer plays a kindly neighbor, one who is involved in doing whatever is necessary to keep the roof over her and her daughter's heads. There is chemistry here, at first easily dismissed, but I have to speak about a scene which is my favorite of the film, in which she surprises him in a diner, sits down with him, and thanks him for not being the same as everyone else she's met since she fell into the luring trap of Hollywood. The exchange between the two of them is touching, heartfelt, heart wrenching, and immediately breathes life into what could have been easily written off as a simple revenge movie.

The level of violence here is high, perhaps a bit too high in certain scenes. Violence done realistically is rarely a treat to the eyes... I remember a scene from DRIVE in which a woman's head is taken off with a shotgun blast and you can see every gory detail of brain, blood, and bone as her head explodes in slow motion, and I find it jarring every time I see the movie. It doesn't need to be there, and sometimes in this film the violence comes off in a similar fashion.

I also mentioned the dialogue before... there's a lot of empty words thrown in the usual manner of macho bull and cliched banter. Alfred Molina and Luke Evans, specifically, have the worst lines to spout here, as they have to shout pointless insults back and forth at each other that only serve to take up time, instead of entertain us or keep the plot moving.

There's also a few plot twists that seem overly heavy, once again done for the sake of originality but lacking in a real sense of logic or reasoning that you accept just because you don't really have any other choice once you get into the parts of the movie that really work... you kind of just have to roll with the punches.

All in all, it's not bad. If you love and miss Chadwick, give it a roll. It's not as good as PANTHER. I suppose, in the end, when we remember him, nothing he did is going to compare with that.

Godspeed, Mr. Boseman. You will be missed."
Message from the King,In memory of Chadwick Boseman,I watch this last night to remember a fine actor Chadwick Boseman. He didn't disappoint. It was a fine performance by a great actor and it's sad that he is no longer with us. The movie itself was slow. I felt the pacing could've been faster and the fight scenes could be done better but otherwise it was entertaining. A good Netflix film given a lot them are absolute garbage.

Message from the King,I'll remember this in a positive manner,"Chadwick Boseman carries it no doubt, but I did feel entertained throughout by 'Message from the King'.

It's a simple film. It doesn't do anything revolutionary or anything, yet still managed to keep me watching with interest for practically all of the 102 minute run time. I like how it starts most, with the connections feeling believable. It loses some of that as it goes on, though it didn't affect my enjoyment all that much.

Boseman really is the only true star of this though, as he gives a very good performance in the lead role as Jacob. Luke Evans (Paul) is pleasant too, while Teresa Palmer (Kelly) has a few moments. Alfred Molina (Mike) also appears, as do Messrs Draco Malfoy and Brad Bellick...

The ending isn't the greatest, though it is still serviceable. That coupled with the nice look of the film and a certain Mr. Boseman mean I'll remember this in a positive manner."
Message from the King,The message got through. The hard way.,"""It's Bianca. She's got a brother. He's in town, says he has what we've been looking for. He's out of control, Mike. You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore. Bianca isn't a problem anymore. I'm afraid that's his problem.""

Those who imagine the Los Angeles metropolis to be idealistically beautiful, they should adjust that view after watching ""Message from the King"". The less beautiful part of Los Angeles is used here. An impoverished neighborhood where the vast majority of residents live in poverty and where crime and drugs are an obvious part of society. Ash gray ghettos full of human suffering. And that's being emphasized by drizzly weather. The crowded mortuary is a reflection of these fading slums. A collection of nobodies who died because of an overdose, madness (drowned in a bathtub as an imaginary fish) and gang violence.

This is what Jacob King (Chadwick Boseman) faces when he arrives in L.A. The reason why he's staying in the city of angels is the sudden disappearance of his younger sister Bianca (Sibongile Mlambo). Soon he discovers the sore situation his sister got herself into and what it did to her : she earned a spot in the mortuary with a name tag on her big toe. The search for the murderers of his younger sister brings him in touch with all kind of figures. Trish (Natalie Martinez) the loyal neighbor points him in the right direction after which he meets a violent gang of Balkan criminals run by a certain Zico (Lucan Melkonian). Then there's the rich dentist Wentworth (Luke Evans) and the wealthy movie producer Preston (Alfred Molina). And let me tell you. Some of them are getting to know the bicycle chain he just bought, in a less pleasant way.

For Jacob, these L.A. neighborhoods probably still look like charming neighborhoods compared to where he comes from. His sister Bianca, his deceased brother Isaac and Jacob himself, lived the largest part of their life in South Africa in the Cape Flat townships, a sandy area south of Cape Town and better known as ""Apartheid's dumping ground"". A dilapidated community where gangs rule. Both in the slums and in prison. Such as ""The Number Gangs"". Isaac was a member of this notorious gang, until his death. Reason enough for Bianca to turn her back on her home country and to seek salvation in the United States.

You could say this movie is a cheaper version of ""The Equalizer"" with Boseman having an equal personality as Denzel Washington. A cold-blooded but alert person who has control over his violent eruptions and who accurately follows the traces to solve the criminal puzzle in the end. However, the ultimate motive remains quite mysterious. Perhaps the only minus I could find in this hard-core, ultra-dark movie. In fact, it's an ordinary revenge film that differs slightly from others because of its quirky atmosphere and tone. And afterwards I discovered the film was directed by a fellow countryman : Fabrice du Welz. Maybe that's why this movie displays a kind of willfulness.

Even though this action-flick is soaked by cliché elements (corrupt policemen, a cunning politician and a prostitute (Teresa ""Lights Out"" Palmer) who plays the Good Samaritan), you can speak of a stylish end product. No explicit violence scenes (the result is usually more explicit than the action itself) and a few star-like interpretations like that of Teresa Palmer. But especially Chadwick Boseman impressed. A man with few words, but hard negotiating techniques. From the very first instance, I was fascinated by him. In my opinion, this is yet again a rough diamond that simmers on Netflix undiscovered. Don't let anybody stop you from watching this when you bump into it somewhere, because this will surely surprise you.

Message from the King,A simple story with a solid script,"A simple story with a solid script with action and twists. When Jacob King from South Africa does not hear from his sister in America. He decides to visit and uncovers a pit of lies and betrayal.

I enjoyed this cracker. I knew, where the story was going and then the story takes a side step. Which leaves you like mmmm OK and then your back to where you thought the story was going.

Now my issues, the accent was too strong or low. Which stopped certain scenes from connecting. Also I'm not going to lie a car chase scene and some one liners would have made it Fire. And the action needed more multi angles (point of view shots). But this would add 1000s to budget and editing time. Modern film making is control by numbers, like most products today. So, I am not disappointed and I cant wait for this teams next project.

Apart from that very good watch. Casting and performances were strong. If you like films like taken with a touch of born identity. Then this is the Netflix title for you. One the best crime action dramas on Netflix today."
Message from the King,Family business,"Another King role for Chadwick. Just kidding and I haven't seen Black Panther yet (though that situation will be remedeed later on tonight). This movie is a straight up revenge thriller. And I really am not telling you anything you won't read in the description. Chadwick is the stranger who comes into town - in search for his sister and his nephew.

Now you can imagine that he won't just find them the minute he comes over. What he does find is some friends and quite some trouble. With an interesting choice in ""weapon"" he goes on to find out what happened. Now if you are a pacifist, you may not like how he approaches certain individuals or how he revolves arguments or how he achieves getting information from certain individuals. But this is a movie and a certain motivation plus determination will lead to a violent resolution. Question is: how well is it made? I'd say more than decent enough. It doesn't add anything really new to the genre, but it is well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) ..."
Message from the King,"An underrated and excellent thriller, a fantastic Chadwick Boseman","This film was made around the period when Chadwick's illness was discovered. He made the majority of his films since then, between surgeries and chemos. As another reviewer noticed he's an actor comparable to Denzel Washington. Maybe yes, unfortunately he hasn't had the time to prove that. My first thought was the same when I first saw him, btw. This film, Marshall, 21 Bridges, and of course Black Panther: mnany different roles and all superb acting. His passing is an irreplaceable loss for his family, for the black community and for every moviegoer and filmlover. Rest In Peace, Chadwick. Your memory never will be forgotten. You remain the King and a Hero in many ways."

Message from the King,Hidden Among the Rags (of LA) comes a Beauty of Cinematic Excellence,"This movie shows you what cinema should look like. This old craft of making movies with tempo, cinematography, editing and score is deprived of all imprints of judgement, opinion or the director's indulging in his pretentious personality as many directors strive to do these days; it seems that the director has nothing to prove but only the commitment to telling a beautiful masterful story filmed with excellence and craftsmanship. The goal here is to learn what real cinema is. Everything serves the story, everything is well balanced. It's an exercise in genre and a director's pure intentions to making only cinema. You don't get pitiful emotion or euphoric fake bliss you only marvel in excellence. No shot is overrated, no emotion is fake. This is a work of a master. And these days masters are found in Europe. It brought me back to my film school days when I was in awe with the great directors of past and how they can create a work of art without the excesses of today's cinematic work that is riddled with uselessness and has no soul or beauty. Mind you, this is not a masterpiece, far from it; rather this is a lesson of what true cinema is... Watch it and be in awe..."

Message from the King,"A solid film, only lacking a kicker to make it great","I wasn't at all sure what to expect going into 'Message From the King'. I was skeptical about it based purely on the cheesy title. I decided to give it a go though and I'm glad I did. I wouldn't say I loved it but it was a very solid and enjoyable film for the most part. There was adequate violence and the action/fight sequences were well executed and fun to watch.

The characters are a large part of what make this film so good. Both the hero and the main villain are well created characters and well cast also. Chadwick Boseman in particular impressed me. He brought a terrific intensity to the film and definitely had you rooting for him and caring about the fate of his character. On that note, this is a very dark film. I can't remember one single piece of comedic relief in the entire run time. It's not a film I can see anyone being blown away by, but it's also a film I couldn't imagine anyone not enjoying."
Message from the King,Solid 6,"This movie is quite gritty and dark, it shows the underbelly of LA. I found all of the actors very good. Boseman is solid as ever. I am not sure what would have pushed it into a 7/10. I have seen some of the very negative reviews and I think it's a little unfair. I would give it a go if you have a few hours spare"

Message from the King,No idea why this isn't rated higher!,I know some Netflix films can be a little rubbish but they excelled themselves here. In my opinion the whole cast excelled especially Chadwick Boseman who carries his role off beautifully with a great accent that has no weak points - revenge thrillers are common but few as well acted or with a script as well written. I was engaged from beginning to end - the twist is superb.You won't regret watching this movie.
Message from the King,Violent & Touching,"Nice ID twist right at the end, intense violence, multinational cast, excellent actors, average revenge story. Lots of comeuppance."
Message from the King,Message from the King: a TV movie.,"This movie puts together some among my favorite actors: from Alfred Molina to Luke Evans or Teresa Palmer or Chadwick Boseman, and follows an intriguing storyline.

Unfortunately (on my opinion) the final result suffers the destiny of many TV movies: a plot doomed by annoying logical holes, an unkempt sequence of events and an (even more disturbing) insufficient development of key characters

Too many good actors for a missed opportunity."
Message from the King,Solid revenge thriller,"The story is nothing really special. Guy comes to LA to look for his sister and he gets tangled in the mess that she was in. He uses his tough South African skills to punish people. Liam Neeson did it with great success, Chadwick Boseman does it too.

It was the acting that was pretty decent, though, as well as the portrait of the city as a corrupt place that feeds on hope and takes it all away. The ""message from the king"" is that you may have a lot of money and live in a big rich place and still be just as rotten as the most crime ridden places in Africa.

Bottom line: a linear and predictable story that only highlighted the good acting and subtle message on the background."
Message from the King,A memorable character,"This film tells the story of a South African man, who goes to Los Angeles to find his sister who is missing. During his investigations, he learns by surprise that she has a stepson, and is involved in shady businesses before she is murdered. He sets out to hunt for the killer and seek revenge.

""Message from the King"" may have a good plot, but I have to say that my enjoyment of the film is hindered by the strong accent of the lead character. There are times when I hardly can understand him, and I have to guess what he is saying. Other than that, his calm composure, quick reaction time and being street smart make him a memorable character. I wish the film more explicitly tells exactly who he is back in South Africa. Though there is a hint at the end, I am left hoping for more information on the background story."
Message from the King,Not bad and good ending.,"Certainly shows the gritty underbelly of LA. Not the South Central gang-centric scenes we are normally given but how other nations have infiltrated and made it their crime bed too.

Some of the content piqued my interest so know I know a bit more about South African prison gang culture, interesting knowledge is never bad.

The story is fairly sound, person missing, person looks for person, a bit of blackmail and violence, but the end (in my opinion) was a surprise and good."
Message from the King,Nothing special in a crowded genre,"The one-man against many revenge film has become quite a robust genre of its own. Message from the King is another in a long line of Taken-style movies, this time with Chadwick Boseman playing a man from Africa who comes to the US looking for his sister. When he finds she is dead, things start to go downhill from there. There isn't much to latch onto with this film. The story is paper thin, even though they keep trying to throw more people onto this conspiracy. In reality, it was just an easy way of creating more victims for our hero, since he takes no prisoners. Even the action sequences were fairly lackluster, so I was almost bored with the movie. It was interesting to hear Boseman working on his African accent that would later be used in his performance as Black Panther, it's just a shame that they didn't give him much to do here. The character is quiet and measured in every scene, so he doesn't get a chance to show his acting talent. There were times I thought he might be bored with the movie just like me. There's still something satisfying about these revenge movies, and I can't say that Message from the King is all that bad. It just lacked something special to make it a movie worth revisiting or recommending to anyone else."
Message from the King,"Good Film, Not Great","Atmosphere carries a film like this. This one was a bit lacking in that respect, but Boseman's performance keeps it above the level of fail. Inscrutable in visage and reticent in words, he makes the most of the lead's mysterious presence. Silences are as important as dialog here. The confessional urge is refreshingly absent.

It departs from the norm of modern US noirish films, in its showing of violence as the ugly, painful business it is. There's nothing heroic or manly about it, it's not showing strength or proving superiority - it's people without compunction inflicting pain in the act of injuring or killing other people.

Those who like to watch this sort of family revenge drama taken to the top, or over it, are urged to watch Soderbergh's 1999 film, The Limey, with Terence Stamp in the title role. Message from the King shares many characteristics with it; Soderbergh's film hits the highs that this one just misses. Although, we're likely to come away thinking Jacob is a decent man, while Wilson is a monster. Which is okay."
