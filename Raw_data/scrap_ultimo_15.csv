Bonus Family,Another NFLX Homerun,An absolutely entertaining uncomfortable wonderful show with great actors. I went through almost the same situation and its comforting to know that it happens all over the world and is not unique to me or the US.
Bonus Family,Big Irish Fan,I'm a big fan of anything scandanavian . Great show top notch acting . Really captures modern European family life.
Bonus Family,Great depiction of modern family life in Sweden/Europe,"I binge watched most of the three series on Netflix. The series shows a couple, their exes and the children from their respective relationships. The newly gained children or parents are not called stepson or stepmother, but bonus-son or bonus-mother. Other than this politically correct streak, any issue that might arise in these circumstances comes round: a child with ADHD, adolescent moods, exes still being in love, grandparents barging in etc. And these are dealt with in a modern way, i.e. not judgemental, but also not always very efficient. I loved the realistic display or people changing their mind on both rational (not often) and emotional grounds as well as the unlikely couples (as in life): the 'anally retentive' math teacher with the liberal, artsy mother; the career-wise not very successful man, still living in with this mother, getting the most balanced wife (with a complicated family) and the rather spoilt children growing up and dealing with/exploiting their having to live (part of the time) with all their parents and their bonus siblings. And last but not least, the peculiar therapists couple that is called for frequently. The negative reviews you might encounter here, to me demonstrate that the show is so realistic that some people start to criticise the characters' actions (as morally or otherwise corrupt). Especially after the cliff hanger of the third season, I hope Netflix will commission the fourth series. I will certainly watch it."
Bonus Family,Top notch show that will not disappoint you for a single second,"First of all, do not get deterred by the fact that it is Swedish: it has nothing of the dry, coward European cinema. The subject itself is nothing new: the problems of a recent couple along with problems of their children, ex-partners, new partners of their ex-partners. But it is so brilliantly written and perfectly played, it doesn't let you down for a single episode. It a shows about serious matters (family, commitment, divorce, kids...) but approached with a great sense of humor and (rare thing) really funny jokes. It also has great characters and witty comebacks that make it a hidden gem that I hope Hollywood will never remake."
Bonus Family,Great series.,"Just a couple of things: The negative or lukewarm reviews here seem to do mostly with people claiming offense at the living arrangements. But this sort of mixed and complex family configuration, which can be found in many contemporary societies, is precisely what the positive term ""bonus family"" indicates. If you're priggish about contemporary family practices, then don't watch a series whose very title gives you advance warning of what it deals with.

Second, this is absolutely not a Scandinavian version of Modern Family. Except for the general framing of contemporary cross families that have become common with the availability of divorce, there are no similarities between the two series. Indeed, to think that there are is reductionistic and even carries a whiff of ethnocentrism as Bonus Family is much better than Modern Family and not just a rip off but a highly original work that stands on its own merits.

Third, while I share the exasperation with the Eddie character and agree that he is a horrible spoiled brat, he really doesn't take up that much screen time and his presence simply injects a very realistic dimension to the intertwined family lives. No one should not watch the series just for a single character."
Bonus Family,Parenting or lack thereof,Comentario no disponible
Bonus Family,"Entertaining, but...",... it gets old watching a bunch of spoiled kids parented by even more immature adults than they are. No real plot. Okay for what it is - a respite from thinking.
Bonus Family,"A unique drama series, haven't regretted a single second watching it!","It's not a stereotypical drama series, I understood that from the first episode. The direction, the script, the actors, everything is so well executed that it makes bonusfamiljen unforgettable. The plot has so many twists and lessons that makes you empathy every single personality. I would recommend it to everybody, one of the best series I've ever watched!"
Bonus Family,Entertaining but sometimes painful to watch,"While I couldn't stop myself from binge watching all three seasons, the second hand embarassment and anger I felt towards the character of Lisa made my blood boil. She might be the most annoying movie/TV character since Forrest Gumps Jenny."
Bonus Family,I just hate Lisa,"I hated, I hated, I hated her. She was such a selfish, unmature, whiny and greedy woman with no ability to raise her children. Otherwise this could have been a great serie."
Bonus Family,Some really good acting here but frustrating!,"Eddie. Eddie Eddie Eddie.

Clearly Frank Dorsin has a real future in acting given that I haven't found or seen any comments where anyone actually likes his character. Eddie is the biggest pain in the neck EVER.

But actually so painful he ruins many episodes.

I just hope Frank hasn't been typecast!

I think this could be a real go to series every week... but without Eddie. The rest of the characters are likeable and you can really see where the writers are coming from."
Bonus Family,THE BEST SHOW EVER,"This show is incredibly good, it is so real that it transcends language and geographical differences. It is funny, sad, moving, relevant -- everything together but not sappy like so many of these family dramas can be. I loved every minute of it and wanted more when it finished. The fact that it is Swedish does not make it any less relatable -- it makes it even better because we get a glimpse into a country and culture that we read about and know as almost a Utopia, with all their social benefits, great education system, open attitude -- and we see them with problems that everyone has at the same time as being able to appreciate what a great country it is. Please whoever is out there who has power over this series, renew, renew, renew!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Bonus Family,Season 1&2 were great but then...,"First two seasons were great and I just loved the show, would give 9 stars for them, but something happened in season 3. They somehow lost the touch, and it wasen't the same again, story line and characters become more like unreal and even irritating."
Bonus Family,The character Eddie makes the show almost unbearable to watch,"Unfortunately I think it is a very good show. However many times I have wanted to stop watching because although the writing, characters, and story line are very well done. ""Eddie"" is an out of control horrible spoilt and undisciplined brat. With a bad attitude and foul mouth on him. He is a bully he is rude and and is a complete and utterly annoying iratation to watch. ABOSUTELY DREADFUL!!!! And the parenting or complete lack of it I find disgusting. The adults come across as mindless fools when it comes to Eddie with their reactions or lack there of are outrageously unbelievable. Everyone I have ever spoke to shares the same opinion, the characteristics of Eddie are so off putting and unacceptable that they are the reason many people have or are considering to stop watching the show"
Bonus Family,Lovely to watch,As an Dutch expat living in Spain I watch this Swedish serie via Netflix. This Swedish family gives me such a good feeling. It makes me feel easy. I love it to watch. I hope many episodes will follow then the 3 I have seen till so far.
Bonus Family,a really good show about regular people,"Finally there is a series that is NOT about drugs, drug lords, gangsters, the mob, nasty politics or vicious people who prey on others. this is a well done, nicely acted, well written/directed human story about modern living and the trials/tribulations that come with it and how not rich people evolve in making life good decisions. many situations are fully recognizable and give one a good perspective on their lives. i would have to agree that the parenting is really rather poor. both eddie and Bianca are selfish, lazy, foul-mouthed and totally undisciplined. it seems the fathers have the right idea but acquiesce to the mothers. the third season left me hanging, so i hope there is another."
Bonus Family,How NOT to parent,"I normally love Scandinavian shows, especially Swedish but this show is a horror show disguised as a dramedy. Zero good parenting; Uber selfish and immature adults and, William aside, nightmare children. Especially Eddie. Everybody is selfish, stupid, self absorbed and have no empathy. None. Not an ounce of sympathy for anyone other than themselves. The opposite of your usual ""Nordic"" show. Ship Eddie to Ireland, he'll shape up right quick."
Bonus Family,Confusing to say the least..,"I wanted something that would be an easy watch in order to progress with my Swedish better, but that's as enthused as I am with the programme. There's no definitive storyline, and it almost seems like the writers tried to really stretch out the content they had for each episode. Added parts to the story seem pointless - like Martin's mum and Gugge, Katja's relationship with the office guy. None of it really gels together well enough for it to be significant or make much sense. I'm currently episode 2 of season 2, so will continue to give the benefit of the doubt. Lengthy and can be slow at times, but overall an easy watch."
Bonus Family,"Swedish version of ""Modern Family""","This is a well written, funny version of ""Modern Family"". Because it is set in a different culture, it has its own originality. If you are not familiar with Scandinavian culture and their way of thinking, you probably may not relate well to the plot. The story revolves around a family of ""exes"", who have changed partners and are trying to make the change in family life and dynamics a workable one. There is the attempt to maintain old relationships so as not to radically change the family dynamics, all this while trying to make new relationships work. The acting is very good, and the issues associated with each character really comes through....no holds barred! The sexually liberated themes may not sit well with more prudish audiences but it is a reality in that culture where sexual activity and education starts early, and is regarded as a natural bodily function that is openly discussed. The subtitle translation is well done in ""modern"" English, and this fits well with the current way of conversing in today's world. Overall, it's a great series and I hope there will be a second season shown here in the US."
Bonus Family,"I liked season 1, but I took 3 stars off for season 2","While it's interesting to see modern and complex family dynamics, quite a few characters have really started to grate on me, especially Lisa, who seems to have no social boundaries and pushes her will and kids on everyone. And it's not as if she's got easy going kids.

In season 2, even the sensible people make weird and stupid decisions and they force all of that on their ill behaved kids. It just gets very difficult to watch after a while.

It's a No for me now. I cannot keep it up anymore."
Bonus Family,Emotional Family Drama Done Well,"I wasn't sure I believed this series could deserve all the awards it's won according to IMDB, but it's not long after watching that you realize that this is really good drama. I loved it and spent the whole week binging on all three seasons, it was like spending a week with family, although family dramas are not my favorite genre. I generally prefer more mystery, intrigue or a good who-dun-it, but I found this to be as good as the U.S.'s This Is Us, completely different stories to tell, but an emotional roller-coaster for us the viewers as they bring our own emotions to the surface. Even the subtitles which can make or break the experience of watching something in a foreign language were spot on. In fact, everything was spot on; the acting, the editing and the directing. Thanks Netflix, I would expect to see this on Masterpiece, well done."

Bonus Family,Horrible parenting,"Its like watching a horror film, the complete lack of parenting its just horrible. I may stop watching because found unbearable how Lisa allows his son and daughter to disrespect Patrick, who may be a particular kind of masochist because the life he has with his bonus family its just awful. His kid suffers too, he is kind of a second class citizen, what makes Patrick a bad father as well, but not the point of Lisa. She is also a very disrespectful partner and wife. She alerts him she is a very difficult person while pregnant, so I started second season hoping to see some humanity in her, but she is just the same b***c pregnant or not. In their own words, they are white trash and there is a limit of trash that I can see. The acting its excellent, that's why I may stop watching, it upsets me seen that the most mature advise this parent gets comes from their 15 years old girl. By the way, I may miss how they approach the theme of ADD since so far it has been just ignoring it, and its sad the producers may miss the opportunity to show some light into it, that they are many options before medication that gives tools to whom suffer because of it. Maybe in the future episodes they will address that but I think there is only so much suffering, unlike Patrick, that I can take. The most fun comes from the therapist couple, almost as dysfunctional as the bonus family, but at least they made me smile and not scream."
Dorohedoro,,
Secret City,Now THIS Is What I'm Talkin About.. Absolutely Wonderful!,"It's been a very long time since I got to enjoy something as bizarre as Dorohedoro... the animation, humor, and absolute insanity brings me back to shows like FLCL and other early 2000s anime. If you need to be spoonfed your storylines this anime isn't for you; you'll be lost most of the time as to what's going on. But if you just sit back and enjoy the LSD trip, you'll get to enjoy the mind of one seriously messed up artist LOL"
Secret City,Crazy Good Sense,"I'm absolutely obsessed with this anime

I think this was the 1st anime that gave me no nonsense or the feeling that i probably didn't get or feel right with something just because im not Japanese or deranged. All characters have their quirks and don't get me wrong... its an insane world, but yet all characters have an incredible ""good sense"". By this i mean that the character seem to react in a very natural way to every situation.

The story is super interesting from the get go and the art reminded me a lot of Akira so that was an easy win.

Super well paced, awesome fights, awesome animation and above all i always ended every episode with a good feeling.

So good i don't think i wanna spoil the anime with the manga."
Secret City,"Refreshing, bizarre, awesome","Surprisingly good. Animations are pristine, really, rarely see such beautiful artwork. Fast paced, engaging and very creative storyline. Quirky, dark, fun, distopian, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, bizarre, beautiful it has it all."
Secret City,"If Kafka, Tarantino, and Murikami collaborated on an Anime this would be the result.","Having read the source material, this is a great adaptation of the manga. When reading the graphic novel it's hard to conceive the black and white illustrations in full color. The stark contrast of bright psychedelic colors of the anime don't diminish the gritty atmosphere created in novel.

There is no protagonist or antagonist in this dark tale of magic and violence. Instead its a pragmatic exploration of unique characters that you will grow to appreciate more as their backgrounds are revealed. Like most unique pieces of story telling it is not for everyone and those looking for traditional plot lines will be confused or frustrated. The story is like an endless rabbit hole, so more mysteries are revealed than are answered. The creators are in on the joke giving you plot reminders at the beginning of the episode like a character's favorite food instead of important plot lines.

It is best watched as a journey into a dark magical violent alternative universe with no destination in sight."
Secret City,Something fresh in a sea of cookie cutter animes,"Dorohedoro is bonkers. Brutal, humorous, fun, unique, and willing to take chances. I really hope they continue to make these I haven't read the manga but I might have to after watching this first season. Season 2 please!"
Secret City,An unique masterpiece,Mappa completely nailed this anime adaptation...the background art looks amazing ...the soundtrack is amazing ...the animation is great..they managed to maintain the creepy tone of the manga
Secret City,Amazing Anime! Want Season 2!!!,I loved it so so much! One of my favorite anime. The world is just incredible and I want more!
Secret City,Crazy man!,"Hands down, this is the most bizarre Japanese Anime I've seen, to date! It takes a very special (or sick) mind to comprehend these story plots. Most revolve around killing, sex or doing drugs. Some of you may be too young to remember an animation back in the eighties called Heavy Metal. The music is all part of the experience of course. Just groove too the move and see if you can get into this alternate universe and Japanese way of thinking. I like it so far, and ill keep you posted! Pax and love, Murf"
Secret City,Unique Anime with bizzare psychedelic worlds,"Loved this anime, Totally surprised, also learnt it's based on a cult hit manga. Great animation, unique art and worlds, kick ass sound track, engaging storyline.

So happy Netflix is pumping out more and more anime, I feel like Netflix has finally turned things around and hired the right ppl in their anime team who are picking up really good Anime projects

Keep them coming Netflix !"
Secret City,Wild,"Really original in my opinion. The story bounces around a lot and is kind of hard to follow, but aside from that the action is wild, the gore is amazing, the animation is nice, and it just is well put together. Favorite anime to watch right now hopefully theres a season 2!!"
Secret City,A very good adaptation of the manga,"The plot is really nice, faithfully following it's manga couterpart (which I am a big fan of) and even though the first season ends at a some kind of a pivotal point for the beginning of the ""actual plot"", one can pick up the manga (Vol. 7 ch.41) as it is already completed. Also one MAJOR plus it that the animations are spot on and not sketchy or rushed like other animes I've seen. Season 2 is already in my to-watch list for sure."
Secret City,A refreshing take on anime.,"While I was initially put off by the gore and bizarre animation style of Dorohedoro, the more of it I watched the more I began to love the show for its quirks: the grunge aesthetic of The Hole, the fantastic world-building, and the fact that, for once, the female characters are badass too. Hayashida's authentic portrayal of vulnerable, yet powerful protagonists and ""antagonists"" gives us a story in which we root for every character, even those which we would conventionally consider evil. Most importantly, perhaps what reels me in to this series is the large part of the world which still remains unknown to viewers, forcing us to wonder who Kaiman really is. Overall, the series gives us a refreshing take on conventional anime and puts us in a strange world of magic and lizards, heartwarming friendship and death, which you will grow to love."
Secret City,"Unique and Stylish, But Slow To Find It's Feet","One of the most outlandish anime I've ever watched, and I mean that in a positive sense! A truly bizarre world with even more bizarre characters inhabiting it. It has some kickass 3D animation and a great soundtrack to boot. It's also very violent, but most of it is highly stylised mind you, and I found it took a few episodes to really get into gear, but beyond that it's pretty good!"
Secret City,"Trippy, dark, unique and imperfect.",Comentario no disponible
Secret City,Anime Horror in a dystopian Wizard/Mutant Hellscape,"This has to be one of the strangest animes I've seen, which puts it in the strangest tv/movies since anime tends to be pretty far out there. If you don't like hyper violence and bleak worlds then this isn't for you. I don't even know how I'd describe this show except there are 2x worlds. A world of humans that is post-apocalyptic and where people struggle to get by. They constantly have sorcerers basically warp into their world and practice magic on them. Turning them into strange bugs, giving them lizard heads, etc. The sorcerers come from a relative paradise... something looking like Paris or Belgium. Some sorcerers are powerful magic wise and with that comes power/respect/resources and some groups or families are basically the elite of their world. On the top are devils which are sorcerers who trained to become devils and are sort of like the ultimate rulers and most powerful beings of the world, but they seem to have some rules and sort of come into play rarely.

A human gets his face turned into a lizard head and gets amnesia. Now he hunts sorcerers with a woman who initially helped him and owns a local restaurant in the strange hell hole humans live in.

Like a lot of other anime, violence is completely over the top and many characters love heinous violence. A lot of the most gruesome violence gets healed fairly instantly. It's hard to tell when someone is actually dead or when they can come back through magic or something beyond the viewers' understanding. So in the end the violence isn't all that serious since it seems to rarely lead to a permanent death.

I would watch this if you are not easily offended or disgusted and already enjoy some anime like Akira/ x hunter x/demon hunter/etc. You might still enjoy it if you don't like anime since it's very unique and interesting. I feel like the grotesque curiosity and just trying to figure out how these strange worlds work pulled me in a lot. It kind of reminded me of what got me addicted to Attack on Titan. Bizarre things happen and you want to understand what the **** is happening. I really enjoyed this show because the art is top notch and the universe crafted in this is very unique. It definitely won't be for a lot of people though."
Secret City,"Dark, Gritty, and Funny",Comentario no disponible
Secret City,"first two episodesare amazing, looking forward to the rest","Just watched two episodes, and I enjoyed it a lot. The story is a bit complex at first sight, but after some time you started to understand whats going on. The atmosphere is amazing- grim, distopian, post-apocalyptic kinda setting mixed with Mobeus style elements, and Manhunt and Hotline Miami (games) style masked characters. Lots of violence and gags. Amazing."
Secret City,Best anime of the year.,"The drama the humor and the gore puts this anime in my favorites easily, but what takes it up to the true greatness is the level of the world building that we can witness here,this specific aspect can go so many levels and different directions , i just cant wait and see where this takes us. Humor 9/10 Gore 10/10 Story telling 8/10 World build 10/10 Lore 9/10 And a Unique score for this anime only Masks 10/10"
Secret City,Without a doubt a total banger!,"Dorohedoro... this was a show that caught my eye while scrolling through Netflix's library a couple of years ago. I was looking for something new to watch when I was pretty much out of ideas back then. When I saw the title profile, I was instantly interested in Kaimen's story and what happened to him. Bloody, gorey, funny, intriguing and action-packed, this show has a story that just had me left with more questions than answers. But I don't mind that to be honest because the show still has plenty more to tell. The premise is interesting because Kaiman is looking for answers to the question and mystery of who he is and what happened to him. I was totally hooked by episode 3 and is definitely a top 10 anime for me. I absolutely love it! The world that the show is created in is so bizarre that I was pining for the next episode to hit. This show is a somewhat strange but really, really cool one. I totally recommend this for the action/adventure fans but with a splash of weirdness! Without a doubt a total banger!!!!!

Check it out, it's a good one."
Secret City,loved story and humor and action till now,Action is great and story is unique too. Anime style is unique too overall good anime. Definitely deserve much more attention. Can be a masterpiece of all time
Secret City,Incredible !!!!!!!,"What we have here is a truly immersive lore. A world so messy and yet so wonderful !!!

But the characters of the show really defined the whole story. A great work was especially done in the animating the characters. I also commend the voice actors for japanese AND english !!!!"
Secret City,"Well, This Was A Pleasant Surprise","I thought this was great. I found it refreshing seeing an urban/dark fantasy with characters who aren't boring, dumb, whiny, overpowered teenagers stuck in a convoluted love triangle where the main character is the chosen one. I also like how it portrayed magic in a more ""scientific"" way. Magic (especially in anime) is usually depicted as an abstract force of nature that anyone can learn with enough determination or a whimsical god-given gift that only a privileged few are born with. In Dorohedoro, sorcerers are just people that have a tumor in their brain and unique glands that shoot black dust out of their mouth and hands. Also, almost all the magic users are either murders, cultists, mad scientists, sociopaths, or just people going about their daily lives (which usually involves one of the four mentioned). There are no heroes. However, I found myself liking the antagonists as much as the protagonists. It's also hilarious how no one in the anime is phased by the constant gory violence. It gives it a real Tarantino vibe. My only complaint was I thought it was too short, and the pacing was a little off. If you want to watch it, it's on Netflix."
Secret City,I rarely like anime,"I rarely like anime but this one was so dark and trippy, overall interesting. I loved the animation, something i don t see often. The characters were all funny and nice, even the bad guys, which makes this anime even more lovely to watch.

I saw a comment in here saying they didn t like how the women in this show hed muscular features. How do you want them to be? Aren t they fighters? Lol."
Secret City,Season 1,"Am I the only one who has a problem with an absolute jarring space between the story which is about a true genuine friendship between society's outcasts and the manic violence levels, that make every main character there a serial killer?

It's like the series expects us to forget, while watching another surreal comedy bit, that the same character 1 minute before committed mass murder. This is my main grip with the show, that, one must admit, excels in a world building and character design."

Control Z,Not that bad at all 😑,Have some patience and give it a try without reviewing just for upvote Or Helpful...This show is great. Little bit slow sometimes but you will not get bore for sure.. CLIMAX wasn't that great as per my expectations..but still this show is worth watching..
Control Z,Nice Series! That You will not be bored when watching it!!,Comentario no disponible
Control Z,"A TV series about teens, for teens.","Started to watch this show without any expectations. The first two or three episodes got me hooked. Then, little by little, it started to feel more of the same episode after episode. And I must confess that i felt disappointed at the end. There's a lot of situations unlikely to happen in real life or all of the sudden as they are portraied in there. It's also technically inaccurate and many things are just impossible in real life. Psychologically heavy sometimes and incoherent. Don't get me wrong, the show, the characters the locations, the plot, captivate the audience very easily. It's worth watching if you're young (under 18 maybe), don't understand much about computer/technology and don't think much about the details. Then, you may love this show. Otherwise you will probably find it a bit of a waste of time."
Control Z,Lost a point for the very end,Comentario no disponible
Control Z,Season 3 More of the Same,So Season 3 is more of the same with it continuing on until Graduation Day. Am disappointed with the relationships and has more whodunit mystery but kind of predictable. It is only a short season 3 with 8 episodes and enough is enough. Just when you think it is all over there is one last scene which suggest a season 4 may be coming but this should be enough really.
Control Z,Well done!!,"Each episode just gets better and better. Highly intriguing, good plot and subplot which make you watch until the end. I binged it in a day! There are a few plot holes, if you can ignore, 10/10 highly recommended!!"
Control Z,Good idea but bad execution,"The story was firstly wery unnatural i had even goosebumps , but after it was pretty interesting despite still reminding me series Sherlock, (main character). Not great not terrible."
Control Z,very nice effort,"As a mexican spectator I can only ask for more quality content of this kind. maybe its biggest flaw is a somewhat lack of originality, but it's a nice show for binge watching. great acting, great production, some predictable stuff and some unpredictable plot twists too.

overall: nice."
Control Z,it's okay,"Tbh i didn't expect that much so i guess it's an ok series, the plot has a lot of similarities to any other teen tv show you could've already ever possibly watched so yeah, it's the regular kinda good. You don't get bored watching it, but also you don't get that much into it... idk"
Control Z,Not the regular Mexican TV Show,"I'm mexican, so, for everyone out there saying that these actors look nothing like mexicans and all that, well that's the diversity of Mexico, we have people of all kind of color, race, ethnicity, social class. Mexico is not the typical stereotype of sombrero, mariachi, burro and that kind of stuff, and I love that Netflix is pitching TV shows that show this diversity, shows like this and El Club, also from Netflix, does that.

Now the show is really great, it's not a very original concept, but the themes and problematics are really important, not many mexican shows touch them. It's not a perfect show, but it's different. Obviously it has influences from Gossip Girl and Elite, so it makes it really interesting, the execution could be better though.

People should watch this, El Club, Ingobernable, Monarca, La Casa de las Flores and Club de Cuervos to see how diverse Mexico is."
Control Z,This was quite good.,"It reminded me of Veronica Mars, but imho better. Sofia is an outsider dealing with her own issues and going to high school. She is not the daughter of a PI but tends to be observant. One day a mystery comes up that engulfs her school and she and the new kid (sort of Wallace) set about to solve the mystery.

Each episode was well thought out and added to the last one. This also fixed some of the problems in VM. The mystery would be important to teens but no one else. Thus viewers wouldn't be wondering why the FBI wasn't showing up. The mystery was solvable if you paid attention and didn't involve cheating the audience. The explanation was perfectly paced for an entire episode so it felt earned.

I was shocked to discover this takes place in Mexico? Wow, I will not be seeing Mexico the same way again. Definitely worthy."
Control Z,There are series that are a lot worst than this,"A Netflix's serie that doesn't totally represent Mexico's people and culture. Although being common, approaches some issues that are always important to remind that exists in this world. Not diverse though, which can be a thing to improve. Compensates with the great production and direction in Episode 3. Huge scene. Looked very real."
Control Z,I had some doubts (?),Comentario no disponible
Control Z,Where's the police?,People getting abused harmed and killed yet there's no sign of police.
Control Z,13 reasons why + elite = control Z,Why the bas rating? Its actually very good. The only bad thing that the actors are too old to be in high school.
Control Z,Last episode spoiled it,It was going really nice.. Nicely built.. Until the last episode and the end destroyed it seriously.. There could have been many better climax than this..
Control Z,Wonderful!,"This is an amazing show, The plot's amazing the Acting is great and overall very realistic and relatable hope this show gets more hype in the future!🖤"
Control Z,Surprisingly good...,"When I watch the trailer I highly believe it was the Mexican version of Elite, and I wasn't wrong, but this TV show I found more interesting than Elite, the actors are really good and way better than in the Spanish TV show, the story is original until one point and the season 2 have the same level as season one or I even could say better, way better than elite."
Control Z,"You will hate the hacker, but then you WILL LOVE H...!! IT!","It has some failures, but the plot keeps getting better each chapter, specially when we know the hacker, and there's a plot twist, and u understand many things, and that people can change, and that life is not black and white. There are some moments(only a few ones) where the cinematography and the edition are impresive and beautiful. Michael Ronda is a great actor, nice to see him landing in a Netflix show. I wait another season.Netflix please don't cancel it! u cancel all good shows :( The main character (the girl) is like sherlock female for teens, I loved that."

Power Rangers Ninja Steel,It's decent not good but decent.,This show is good I guess. I mean the story's fantastic. But the actors not so good. The blue ranger especially. He acts like he's at a kids party all the time. The other are also not so good actors. But what I liked about this show is that the morphing sequence is awesome. They didn't rely heavily on super sentai footage. The most recent crossover was great too.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,My 5 year old son likes it,"My 5 year old son likes it.

I guess That's all I can say.....

It's not for anyone else than 4-6 year old Boys."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Meh.,Ok the Power Rangers parts are fantastic but when the comic relief comes on screen then it gets bad. Its like this- The rangers on screen I smile when the comic relief comes on then i facepalm and shake my head. If they got rid of them then I think this show would be more awesome!
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Cringe,"Power Rangers should've stayed in 90s. This was a terrible idea, nobody knows how to act in this show at all!"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Fun so far,"So far, it feels a lot like Dino Charge, for better or worse. I expect the rest of it to be fun and entertaining, but not to have as much substance as RPM or Time Force.

I really like the new cast. They know they're not doing Shakespeare and roll with it. The only ones I'm not fond of are the comic relief, the self-involved guy and his nerdy sidekick. They feel too much like the showrunners are trying to revive Bulk and Skull. They waste time. The villains have yet to really stand out, either. Though, I do like the whole game show set up.

I'm also liking the Zords. They're more diverse this time than one unifying theme."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,"A lighter-hearted, more kid-friendly Power Rangers season","I watched all 22 episodes of ""Power Rangers Ninja Steel"" and while I enjoyed them as they were broadcast on Nickelodeon and re-watched most of them, I can't say it's a particularly good season, especially in the wake of the last two cycles (Megaforce, 2013-2014, and Dino Charge, 2015-2016), which turned out to encompass four exemplary seasons, arguably the best since ""Time Force"" (2001). ""Ninja Steel"" puts the five Rangers (with a sixth one joining later) back in high school, but dumbs down a lot of the stories with an eye to pleasing the kiddie audience. It also adds two comic relief characters, a conceited jock and his obsequious sidekick, whose antics will make the kids laugh, but try the patience of older fans who may have fond memories of the original comic PR foils, Bulk and Skull.

An interesting angle has the Rangers' exploits serve as material for an intergalactic reality show called ""Galaxy Warriors,"" in which miscreants from other planets can watch on TV as the monsters employed by alien warlord Galvanax descend to Earth to try to defeat the Power Rangers. When their efforts invariably fail, the program host presses a ""gigantify"" button that causes the vanquished monster to come back to life and grow into giant size, at which point the Rangers call in their Zords to finish the job.

A lot of episodes revolve around problems the five Rangers, Brody, Sarah, Preston, Calvin and Hayley, cause themselves. Brody (Red Ranger) uses his ""datacom"" device to cheat on tests. Sarah (Pink Ranger) creates clones of herself to do some serious, if misguided multitasking. Preston (Blue Ranger) gets hold of some ancient spells, but thinks he can learn them quickly without paying attention to the fine print. Calvin (Yellow Ranger) is in awe of a local driver with a cool car and offers to fix the engine at a time he needs to be available to help the other Rangers. Hayley (White Ranger) and Calvin get into an argument which leads to them running against each other for student government president. Even their robot ally, Redbot, oversteps his bounds when he writes a book taking credit for the Power Rangers' achievements. They all have to learn from the messes that result from their hubris or irresponsibility.

One of the best episodes has the five banding together to take on a local crisis, caused when Preston's father, a real estate tycoon, buys the land that's home to the town's sacred Ribbon Tree, on which the citizens traditionally hang ribbons with their wishes on them. While two of the Rangers rally the townsfolk and another two occupy the tree to keep the bulldozers away, Preston tries to change his father's heart. It's actually quite a moving episode and features excellent performances by the actors playing Preston and his embittered father.

There's an emotional backstory involving Brody and his long-lost brother, Aiden, who were separated as boys when their father, a ninja warrior, disappeared while fighting Galvanax and preventing him from attaining the prized ninja steel. Brody is held as a slave by Galavanax until he's a teenager and manages to engineer an escape with the help of another human slave, Mick, a wild-eyed, wild-haired mechanical genius from another galaxy. They wind up in Summer Cove, where they set up shop at the local high school and find the ninja steel stored in a clever hiding place. Brody never gives up the hope of reuniting with Aiden, which, if you know your Power Rangers, is bound to eventually happen. There's a significant obstacle along the way, but when the reunion finally happens, it packs quite a punch.

In a most unusual development for Power Rangers, two of the Rangers, Calvin and Hayley, are in a committed relationship before the series starts and remain so throughout. They display a lot of affection--holding hands, hugging, putting their arms around each other, etc. It also happens to be a black-white interracial relationship, Calvin being white and Hayley being black, which makes it something of a first in the Power Rangers universe. The Blue Ranger, Preston, is Asian, Sarah is white, and Brody and his brother are of indeterminate ethnic origin. Even though the characters don't have much depth and their relationships lack the intensity of those in Power Rangers Dino Charge, I thought the actors were, for the most part, pleasant and engaging, with special marks going to Chrysti Ane (Sarah), Peter Sudarso (Preston), Nico Greetham (Calvin), and Zoe Robins (Hayley). They were warm and fun to spend a half-hour with.

The series was based on its Japanese sentai counterpart, ""Shuriken Sentai Ninninger"" (2015), although its connection to that series is slight. Some fight scenes from the original are used, although many more fight scenes are restaged in New Zealand for the Ninja Steel scenes. The Zord battles offer the only consistent use of Japanese footage in the whole series and are, as usual, quite imaginative and exciting.

ADDENDUM: The new season of Power Rangers premiered on January 27, 2018, under the title, ""Power Rangers Super Ninja Steel,"" so it's a continuation of the previous season with the same cast and some of the same villains, but with the ninja steel upgraded to ""super."""
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Kids show - stop taking Power Rangers so seriously!,"Is it cringey? Sure. Are the special effects a bit lame? Yep. But - this is a kid's show. Some of the reviews are taking Power Rangers a bit too seriously.

My 7 year old loves it. Like many kid's shows with actors (rather than animated), it is cheesy and over the top but all low budget shows like this are.

Other reviewers have compared it to other versions of power rangers; I remember the 90s version and more recent ones and they were cheesy too! I think maybe some have forgotten? Has any non cringey version existed? Don't think so.

Would I watch it myself? No, but it's great for kids, in that they love it; there's super powers from the ninja star thingys, no real violence (very pretend martial arts and effects style), no swearing or anything inappropriate. Very much a kids show and if you're not playing it for your 5-12 year old then you're probably the wrong audience."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Spining with Power,"This is another under the radar gem, it's not totally overlooked but doesn't really get a whole lot of credit or as much attention as the others which happens in most long running franchises. This was also the last entry in the Neo Saban era and I thought it was a solid finish; yeah it's true the Neo Saban era wasn't the franchise's best era but it wasn't a total loss as there were two solid franchise entries ""Dino Charge"" and this one; so two out of four isn't bad, it's better than none.

The show is going with the Ninja concept once more, but unlike ""Ninja Storm"" which was fantasy this one is sci-fi which is cool and something I'd love to see more as it's a combination of two of the things I love in life sci-fi and ninjas.

The plotline doesn't reinvent the wheel as it's the typical alien invasion scenario but one thing that actually is unique is how the aliens have this game show where each monster they send down to attack the Rangers is televised, sort of like the movie ""The Running Man"". That also isn't exactly a new premise, but I thought it was cool having that in the franchise.

The monsters and their designs are good as usual, especially the two main villains like Madame Odious whom has this fox mask and kimono robes which signify elegance but nastiness which makes the character more deceptive hence her name. But I really like the design on Galvanax it's pretty much an exaggerated Shogun Samurai look but all the same it's cool, and he's really menacing looking. Both are decent villains though not my favorite as they are on the two-dimensional side but they serve their functions.

The music is sold, the theme song is fun really like the fast guitar tunes which fit the nature of the show, and even there is a remixed track or two from the first ""Power Rangers"" show in a episode or two, one of them is one the track you would hear during the Zord battle which I thought sounded cool. I always like remixed tracks showing you can still do more with the track or making them sound even better or unique.

The Ranger characters are cool as their all unique, my favorite is Preston whom is the Blue Ranger. He's cool I like that he's into magic and has big dreams of being the next David Copperfield or any other great magician. Though he's not perfect as he's a little ill confident and his magic act doesn't always work out the way he wants it to as sometimes something goes wrong in the trick but Presto doesn't give up as he keeps plugging away at it and he does get better every time, especially in his confidence.

Haley and Calvin are solid, Haley I think is cute and kind of hot, she sweet but has a certain energy to her, really like that she's into drama and acting which I am myself. Calvin, he the passive aggressive type as am I, that is into automotive but mainly loves to fix and build them. What I like about those two is the fact they're in a relationship. Which I thought was interesting and sort of a first for the show.

Sure, there have been couples in the franchise, but it was most of time just the beginning of a relationship. The chemistry between both I thought was sold there's a good back and forth between them I bought they were a couple with a history. Though it's too bad these two didn't have more episodes together which I'll admit is one weak point of the show, I really would of liked to of seen a little more interaction time between the two, or maybe even a episode where we would see in a series of flashbacks as to how both became a couple to provide depth to them.

Sarah is sold, she's another one of my favorite Pink Rangers if not high on the list. She's fraking gorgeous and hot, with persona to boot. She sort of the technical officer of the bunch much like Billy in the first ""Power Rangers"" just like him she's inventive, very much into science and technology as she has that hoverboard all the time, but she's energetic and outgoing as there is always a lot she wants to do.

But of course, we're all in it for the action and it doesn't disappoint as it's ninjarific. The choreography is well done, really like the fluidity of the Rangers movements which makes sense as the martial art Ninjutsu part of it is based on constant flow. Like the design of the Helmets as each of them have a Shuriken of different design.

The weapons are cool, from the Ninja gos they use and those shurikens which are not just the morphers but are a hook up feature to the gos. The Shurikens they amplify the power of the users but what I really like is how they can mix it up sometimes which can double the power as well, which makes the powers the Rangers utilize seem less stationary and keeps the bad guys guessing. The Zords are also cool and memorable looking, there is this one zord that acts as a command chair to help double the power.

Thought this show has some turbulence in its spin cycle. One of the weak points are some bits of humor are weak, but then again that's comedy most of the time there will be hits and misses. The biggest miss is Victor and Monty, these guys are fraking annoying their obviously poor man versions of Bulk and Skull. I honestly didn't find both funny as their loud and obnoxious, let alone self-serving blow holes. They just take up time which would have been in better use for the Rangers.

And last the show has the same fundamental problem as ""Dino Charge"" where the second season doesn't have as much momentum as the first, it wasn't bad at all I still enjoyed watching but it needed a little more spin.

But the main problem is I don't feel there is much or enough character development. Don't get me wrong the Rangers in this show are solid and seem to be well rounded characters ,but I felt they could of used a little more depth so we could explore and know them even better as well some advancement in their personal lives and not just lifestyles.

Overall, this was a solid entry, it's not on my favorites list but it's good fun all the same that's worth a spin.

Rating: 3 stars"
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Ninja Steel better than the new Power Rangers Movie (2017),"I'm gonna be honest here, this is more on key to what Power Rangers is then that movie that came out in 2017. Growing up with Mighty Morphin and then trying to watch that movie was hard. But this series embodies more of the ranger spirit. Good series."
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Awwesoooomeeeee show,This show Power Rangers ninja steel ( super ninja steel) is the best series ever of power rangers .All credits goes to the awesome and talented cast including directors producers writers and all. Moreover the story line was fantastic which makes it interesting and the rangers along with the cast fit to their roles.
Power Rangers Ninja Steel,Great show,"To the reviewer

Cringe. U dont know what u are talking about"
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,not quite as good as the British versions but well worth seeing,"I am a total GEEK and must admit that have seen just about everything done by the Pythons--including these German episodes (done either in German language or subtitled). And, because I am such a geek, I loved them. BUT, to someone unfamiliar with the team, I don't recommend this until you've seen their other work first. For example, the one episode that consisted mostly of a long fairy tale was very dry and not filled with the outrageous laughs of many of their other episodes--though it was great seeing John Cleese as Red Riding Hood. I also LIKED watching the travelers in Germany being abused (slapping them with fish, etc.) but I realize that this might not be everyone's cup of tea. You won't find as big a laughs as the Parrot Sketch in this batch but a few of their classic bits are reprised (The Lumberjack skit) along with new material."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,"The Beatles did it, Abba did it, Monty Python followed","For the obsessed fan, a rare treat. For non-python people probably just a strange foreign curiosity. Yes, it is real. The Beatles sang in German, Abba sang in German; and then Monty Python acting on an invitation made two episodes for German / Austrian television in 1972.

It is essentially the same concept as an English episode, but in German. The paintings by Albrecht Dürer, fall victim to silly animations. Little Red Riding Hood shows up too. A number of familiar sketches, including the Lumberjack song, work as well in German as they do in English. For those familiar with the original series, it is a very nice mix of known and new material.

In fact, some material has been re-used later with new voice-overs, the Philosophers football match and the Silly Olympics for example, turn up at the Hollywood Bowl performance in 1982 (but the caption gives it away: Epikur is the German name for Epicurus).

All in all, it is for fans only. Relatively unknown and only the first episode is included on the 'Monty Python Live' DVD. The DVD quality is poor. Apparently no German DVD is available! Pity.

Nevertheless, for real fans, it's 'Go get it now!'."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,Monty Python in German? Can't get any better than that!!!,"There are three things you must first bear in mind while watching Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus: 1) Its German 2) The sketches are British as well as the cast 3) Don't waste your time and energy trying to figure out if this show makes any sense because it doesn't and doing so can cause a sudden urge to mine for chickens (no pun intended).

Let me first say that I am a HUGE Monty Python fan. I own all the Monty Python Television Shows, Documentaries, Concerts, and Movies on Video and DVD, and let me tell you that watching Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus never gets old. There are some really great sketches that came out of that show that beat the Flying Circus Years, and there's even a version of the lumberjack song done in German that's pretty amusing.

The story of Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus goes like this; Monty Python's Flying Circus had been a huge success in England and in 1972, Germany, being comically impaired, asked the Python Troupe (Cleese, Idle, Palin, Chapmin, Jones, and Gilliam) if they could make a comedy television show in German, and they agreed. Simple as that. They only made two episodes, one in complete German and one in English, and if your a big Python fan, it would be worth your while to check them out."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,What a great show,"Monty Python came to Germany to write some sketches for the German and Austrian TV and it became one of the best shows of them ever. Alfred Biolek, a forward looking man, did a great job by inviting them.

My absolutely favourite scene is the 100 meter final of the men without any sense of direction. The lumberjack song is also great.

I'm sure it was hard for them to speak ""German"" but they didn't fail. So if you have the chance to watch the show, do it."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,Hilarious,"A two-part mini-series by British comedy group Monty Python made especially for German TV.

Being a massive fan of Monty Python and Monty Python's Flying Circus I was a bit sceptical how a German version would work. Surely you lose something by having them do the skits in German and then having to read the subtitles to get some of the jokes (for those of us who don't speak German, of course)? Can the Pythons even speak German?

Yes, they can speak German, to varying degrees. You do lose a smidge of the impact by having it spoken in German and then having to read sub-titles but it largely feels quite seamless. Moreover, only Episode 1 is in German. Episode 2 is in English and might as well be a Flying Circus, rather than Fliegender Zirkus, episode.

The quality of the humour is on the same level as the Flying Circus stuff, i.e. Wonderfully absurd and brilliant, so no issues there. There are quite a lot of skits from Flying Circus, e.g. Lumberjack Song (in German), Olympic Philosophy Final, Prince Charming marries Mitzi Gaynor, so it's not all new. That would be the only negative, the fact that a large portion of this isn't original. Still very funny though, even if you have seen it before."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,Second rate Python in German is better than nothing!,"BBC America offered the 1st German production for free as part of my local cable company's digital on-demand service so I finally saw it.

It was definitely a surprise to the entire group doing really well with their German. Graham Chapman even attempted to imitate an American tourist speaking German poorly. However, quite a bit of the narration was provided by a professional German announcer.

At first the whole 45 minute effort seemed off and I thought that it was probably since comedy is 90% timing and if you are not comfortable speaking then your timing will likely be off. Later I thought that the material was repetitive from the British show (in tone not content) but that was because the Python crew knew that the German audiences were probably not familiar with their work. As the show progressed and we get an unusual amount of ""toilet"" humor, I thought that possibly they were using rejected / censored material from their British show. Then I noticed that the whole production was on film instead of the film/ live studio mix of the British show. That's when I realized why I didn't fully enjoy this production.

Compare the troupe's skits from the TV show (most of which were performed in front of live audiences) with the same skits in the film ""And For Something Completely Different"". The energy and timing, the use of multiple TV cameras versus one film camera and the input from the audience all combined to improve their work. Imagine if they had done the Bavarian restaurant sketch on their regular show, it would have been funny as opposed to amusing.

I can watch some of the TV episodes over and over, this German one... once is enough."
Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus,A Feeling of happiness,Can you get any funnier this really shows people they we'rent just known in England but Germany as well. Imagine that they not only took time to look through the German landscape but also learned the language. Saturday night Live certinley would not go that far to do something like that. Real classic gems. I wish they would have made more of them.

Fastest Car,"Has potential, needs some tweaks to be great",Comentario no disponible
Fastest Car,It's all about the people.,"It's not about the race. It's about the people and their cars. Each episode introduces us to four new drivers (plus friends and family). The show is about their stories, which unfold as they prepare their cars for a 10 second drag race; three sleepers (souped-up piles of junk) against one bona fide supercar. The people and the cars are what the show is about. The race is just how each episode ends. If you want to watch racing, pick a different show."
Fastest Car,Better than I thought it would be so far,"Definitely a really well done show. There's a lot of focus on the people behind the cars- their motivations, back story, and what they hope to accomplish from the race. You get to learn a little bit about the cars and what's under the hood, but it's not just about trying to match up cars with known quarter mile times and racing against a supercar that also has a known quarter mile time. That certainly wouldn't be good TV. Instead, it's about drivers, their sleeper cars, and stories about real people.

I enjoy fact that the supercar drivers aren't just ""rich assholes"" looking for kicks. They have their own stories as well, and the contrast with the sleeper car drivers is certainly interesting."
Fastest Car,Brilliant,"I turned on Fastest Car to just see some drag races, but what I found was the most moving back stories of sleeper car enthusiasts and their families. By the the time they finally got round to race at the end of each episode I was so invested in them emotionally (and dying to know which car will win!). What a great show, here's hoping for a second season."
Fastest Car,Fastest Depression in the World,"While it's interesting to watch these cars and the effort that goes into them... Why oh why does every driver have a son story and end up in tears!?

Driver 1 ""I'm doing this for my dead mother"" que tears.

Driver 2 ""my wife divorced me"" que the water works.

Driver 3 ""my best friend's dog passed away"" que the deluge.

That's pretty much every episode. It starts to grind on your gears (excuse the pun)."
Fastest Car,The People,"What is great about this series, is the people and their stories. Not only is the Fastest Car filled with neat vehicles for gear heads, but it features amazing stories of struggle and perseverance. I love this production."
Fastest Car,Overload of American-style dramatisation,"In typical American reality-TV fashion, there's an endless amount of cheesy dramatisation and very little actually working on the cars. Everything is so painfully , it feels like the show is made for people with IQ below 70; Supercars owners are intentionally chosen and framed to be as obnoxious as possible and the underdog car builders are have the same repetitive sob-story. Way too much BS and way too little racing and building."
Fastest Car,"Cars, drama and changing the image of people",Comentario no disponible
Fastest Car,Amazing show,Like most people I just wanted to see somedrag races but this show is so well produced it is much much more than 0-100
Fastest Car,Lossers,Comentario no disponible
Fastest Car,A bit played up,"The show is about 40 minutes of talking and 30 seconds of racing. The owners of the cars talk about their ride and what they've done to it, but it seems very repetitive and drawn out. There's a lot of build up for 30 seconds of racing"
Fastest Car,I'm so happy season 2 is here,I love this show. I know nothing about cars but don't care it's REAL and good. Care is put into the production of telling the stories and it really shines through. Love this show please make season 3 FASTEST !!!
Fastest Car,"Not bad, needs some work though...","Ok, it's a great idea, and they almost pulled it off, but there are a few problems. Firstly, a sleeper car is something that doesn't look like it's modified too much. Some of the cars were proper drag cars, virtually none of them were sleepers. Secondly, one race right at the end of each show?! Come on guys, you've gone to all this effort to get these cars to the track, let's see some more races. Thirdly, all the individual episodes were held on a tarmac runway, and then you hold the final on dirt!!!??? What the hell were you thinking??"

Fastest Car,Fun show for car fans,Comentario no disponible
Fastest Car,Less sob story and more car please!,"Its a nice idea. Three sleepers against a Supercar in a 7-day build-up to a 4-car quarter mile drag race. There are some great (and surprising) cars, clever engineering, and the determined persistence of the participants to get that last drop of power to deliver on the day. However, the producers wring every bit of tear-jerking blah-yak out of the back stories, which makes for really painful viewing and keeps the skip button within thumbs reach. I'd like to see the same concept of program in a more serious form, that goes beyond this quasi-reality/drama genre of programming. There are exceptions, but be prepared, the majority of the Supercar drivers in the episodes are the most obnoxious, OTT, excessive characters I have had the misfortune to watch. I hope the concept gets re-hashed at some time in the future into a more palatable viewing experience."
Fastest Car,Amazing,"Loved this show, watched it all in one day. The only downside was the false starts in some of the races but nevertheless very entertaining. Can't wait for season 2!"
Fastest Car,"Great show, one complaint...",Comentario no disponible
Fastest Car,A little disappointed,"Spend 90% of the show talking about the people who build the cars, don't show them working on them much if at all, and then a 30 second race at the end. Was sort of hoping this would have more racing and putting cars together"
Fastest Car,A documentary about people (and their cars),"'Fastest Car' was, unexpectedly, an intensely engrossing show. The presentation, where they introduce each person (and their car) initially one at a time, makes them seem like hard core competitors, each of which have their own prejudices and misconceptions. But then they return to them after showing the hardships they have faced and the core values which motivates them. In the end, it only matters who wins because of the intense joy and validation it provides the winner. But everyone goes home a winner, learning something valuable with each race."

I Am a Killer,No remorse,"I've been watching this series lately, some of the people you feel sorry for. Most of them forget what they've said, then try to change it around. As for the crying only one had real tears. The others were just making sobbing and sniffling sounds. How can you grin when talking about killing someone? No pity."
I Am a Killer,Some good/some bad,Some really interesting episodes and some that seemed more to serve as a he said she said. Good documentary style with relevant interviews.
I Am a Killer,"This shows is almost like a parole hearing, decades after a headline grabbing murder took place","For over a decade I have an interest in anything having to do with true crime. And this with an empasis on jails, prisons, the justice system and court trials. This has led me to read numerous books like prison diaries, forensic science and even autopies. Apart from that, I have seen many of the available prison shows from ""MSNBC Lockup"", ""Locked Up Abroad"", ""Hard Time"", Werner Herzog's ""On Death Row"", ""Behind Bars"" and off course the many shows available on Netflix... Finally, I am follow a lot of murder trials on e.g. ""Law & Crime Network"".

So it probably doesn't come as a surprise that I watched ""I am a Killer"" with a big interest.

What I really like about this show is that it goes beyond showing or reenacting the acts. It is completely based on interviews with not only the inmate, direct family, counsel, prosecutor, victim's family and even the judge. So far as I know it is the only show that even goes back to the inmate allowing him/her to hear all the opinions of those parties.

Not seldom we see tears of anger or regret. The latter could be fake, but it exactly these emotions that make this show special.

The sentenced inmates are also ones with very violent crimes - often murder - whereby the facts took place several decades ago. The inmates interviewed therefore have already been in prison for quite an extensive period. And regularly these inmates are even on death row. This whereby those inmates will be likely in the last stages of their appeal's process, thereby coming close to the point where an execution date will be set.

What makes the third season of ""I am a Killer"" very interesting is that it tries to challenge the viewer in thinking of what exactly is justice. And whether there even may be situations that certain inmates are not guilty or are serving a too big a sentence. Especially in episodes 1-4 from season 3, you will start to think of this ""what is justice""-question...

I was a bit disappointed that the third season only contained 6 episodes instead of the regular 10. But since Netflix nowadays seems to come with some ""surpise releases"" of additional episodes - like they have done with e.g. ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Sandman"" - I still hope that we may get some additional episodes of ""I am a Killer"" in the next few weeks or months.

From reading the above, you may have already understood my enthousiasm for this show. I think it clearly deserves a rating of 8.1, rounded down to 8 stars. I most certainly hope that Netflix will keep releasing new seasons, whereby I also hope that in the future we will again get the usual 10 episodes per season."
I Am a Killer,"Yup, its binge worthy","I skipped over it many times because why would I want to hear from death row inmates? But its now my current favorite show. Very well made with equal time given to each side of the story so that the viewers fully understand what happened. This isn't a show about some liar criminal pleading innocence in the face of evidence proving guilt, they know they are guilty - its often the full story that wasn't told or isn't widely known that will pull you in and that makes it such a good show. As someone else said and I will agree with, prepare for a roller coaster of emotions - and yes, you'll likely shed tears more than a few times."
I Am a Killer,One word Wow!,"One of the best documentaries series, interviewing death row inmates, the idea is so amazing, once you start watching you can not stop. You will go through seesaw of emotions."
I Am a Killer,"Cool concept, but really frustrating to watch...","I really like the concept of talking to death row inmates, but the editing is annoying and frustrating. Why am I watching paint dry up-close, a girl pressing broccoli on the register, coffee being poured, flags, birds, water, snow e.t.c It made me wanna smash the tv and keep fast forwarding."
I Am a Killer,Captivating insight on a handful of death row inmates' cases,"A great binge-worthy show that discusses the motives and circumstances behind selected death-sentence cases. Some reviewers seem angry because ""nobody should be interested in a killer's side of the story; they're killers"" but I think that's where they're wrong. In almost every episode this documentary tells the story behind both sides of the party, the prosecution and the killer, and leaves the viewer to make up his own mind about the case and the punishement.

You will not get bored."
I Am a Killer,Disgusting campaign of disinformation,"This show tries hard to be balanced but it consistently plays the murderer as the victim. The stupid and unneeded slow shots of a local restaurant or park are silly fluffs to add more airtime and minutes to the show. Maybe, just maybe, 2 of these men deserved the life penalty they had their sentence commuted to. Otherwise, this show is absolutely subject and hard to watch. These people killed other people. As much as Netflix tries and frame it, they killed somebody and violently."
I Am a Killer,"Season 3, bring in the nut jobs!","Season 3 rolls out the red carpet for the nuts, and it's not just the criminals.

First episode, the sister tries to prove the killer's innocence despite overwhelming evidence, then convinced her to clam up.

Number 2. Nutty convict correspondent befriends death row inmate probably so she can see another execution. First sentence out of her mouth ""I was the first Italian woman to witness an execution"". Yeah, riiiightttt... All the prisoners have the typical M. O. blame drugs, abuse, blackouts. They all are right where they are supposed to be.

Feel no sympathy for them, they are pathological, violent, and blame everyone but themselves. This show does one thing well; it cements my belief in the death penalty and why we need to make the process more efficient."
I Am a Killer,A fascinating series.,"This is a fascinating, and at times unnerving series. I binge watched the whole of series one in a day, and have series two to look forward to.

I'll start by saying, I am British, so understanding some of the legal system in the US has been challenging, but this has informed me of a lot of things.

You have to appreciate the variety of people they interview, they chat to a range of people, different crimes, different personalities, even different intelligence levels.

Some are genuinely unnerving, and you will leave feeling happy they're locked up, one really did get to me though, Kevin Foster, that one stuck with me, he's the one so far I've had a degree of sympathy with.

These are well produced, well edited, and punchy, they don't drag, they certainly don't bore you, these are instructive and fact based.

A chilling watch, these are binge worthy. 9/10."
I Am a Killer,Interesting Psychological Study,"I Am a Killer is an interesting documentary Netflix series in which convicted murderers describe the circumstances leading up to and the execution of their crime. The killers also generally describe their upbringing and other contributing factors. Friends, relatives, law enforcement and victims families are also interviewed to give alternate perspectives. Questions of guilt and innocence are often left ambiguous as a result of the multi-valent examination of the crime.

I generally do not like shows like this because they often glorify criminals, or at least profit off of their actions, but I Am a Killer does give something significant in return. Like few other shows, this show gives you a very realistic eye into the psychology and contributing factors that give rise to murderers, and is indeed very enlightening in that regard. In most cases, child abuse and substance abuse play substantial roles. Often the murderers seem to be expert liars and manipulators, it is impressive when watching this show to see how fragile the truth can be. Also interesting is the colossal bad judgement displayed by many of these people.

This show is a hard watch, in every case the murders, victims, families have their lives completely shattered. It is worth it, however, if you are interested in shattering many of the misconceptions and myths you may have about violent criminals."
I Am a Killer,Very powerful,"This show provides a humbling insight into what makes a killer, and how their actions have impacted themselves and others. It's an eye opener into how easy it is to look at people who have committed horrific crimes and label them monsters, but in almost every case they have suffered in horrible ways as children, often abused by those closest to them and denied the love and nurture a child needs, and are products of their environments."
I Am a Killer,Slow but interesting,"If the sad piano music is intended to make me feel sad for everyone involved, it's not working. The only thing these murderers regret is getting caught. It's a good documentary, worth watching. What would have made it a fantastic 10 star show would be watching each and every one of these sadistic killers swing at the end of each episode."
I Am a Killer,"Too much ""filler"" stuff!","I love shows like this, but boy did they get it wrong when editing this series. Instead of just focusing on the story, they give us these long drawn out shots of random things. Boats drifting down ocean front property, trees billowing, restaurant workers pouring coffee and serving up the next order of fries. Really? Aye, aye, aye...I was ready to bang my head against a wall. Instead of this looking creative, it only ended up being completely annoying and taking away from the story. This is the sole reason for the low rating of a ""3"" from me. Sorry Charlie. Boo Hiss."
I Am a Killer,"Total ""Onion"" show","By that, I mean, as you watch each episode, more and more layers of the onion are revealed. Incredible study of human nature. Drug abuse, manipulation, desperation, criminality all leading to murder. I was mesmerized watching this series. If you're a fan of Lockup, Cops, Live PD or any crime dramas, do yourself a favor and watch the first episode. I guarantee you you'll end up binging this series."
I Am a Killer,Really loving it,"Interesting crimes, welp paced, just an overall wonderful show. They unravel each story perfectly AND add interviews with KEY players. It's well worth your time if you like true crime."
I Am a Killer,Please watch the far superior Life & Death Row on BBC,"I've just watched this series on Netflix and whilst it's great film making and interesting subjects, this is essentially a rehash of a far superior documentary series on BBC called Life & Death Row.

Some of the crimes and subjects are already investigated in the BBC version (aired 2014), even certain shots and the soundtrack seem lifted from the original.

I am interested to understand how two shows can be made so similarly and why it hasn't been picked up by the IMDb faithful! Let me know your thoughts once you've caught up with the BBC version."
I Am a Killer,Some you feel sorry for others...,"I really enjoy this docu series. It's hard to watch though I don't agree with those that say it's ""binge worthy"". For me I need to watch something funny after because it's often very dark and sad. I need a break between episodes. Some of these guys (the murderers) you genuinely feel sorry for, others are total POSs. You can tell right off the bat who is lying and who isn't. This series really highlights how our justice system is about keeping people in. Not rehabilitation."
I Am a Killer,Episodes are hit or miss,"This first season was decent and certainly higher quality than most of the true crime shows being produced by the truckload recently, though still full of faults and highly variable episode to episode. The second season saw a big dropoff in quality, to the point where many episodes were unwatchable. The show relies entirely too much on captions between shots in order to tell a story, which comes off as amateur and unsuitable for the subject matter. It felt so hacked together and rushed that even blatant typos even made it through. Compared to similar series like Werner Herzog's On Death Row or BBC's Life and Death Row, this series isn't even on the same planet in terms of quality."
I Am a Killer,I've Never Written a Review Before...,"But as a forensic psychologist who has worked many years with offenders in max, I must say this is a highly insightful, accurate and well-balanced series. The series appears to accurately represent the spectrum of situations and personalities who populate corrections as the result of murder. Fairly presented without unnecessary sensationalism. The format of initially questioning inmates and then circling back four months later was excellent. The forensic psychologists included presented themselves professionally and credibly. Great job and kudos to those responsible for this series. Thank you!"
I Am a Killer,Watchable,"It's not that bad nor that great, it is slow here and there, and not really engaging but, watchable.

7/10"
I Am a Killer,Editing issues,"This is an outstanding series that shows more of a complete picture - not black and white at all. Each episode consists of interviews of the convicted person and others involved in some way. Mainly writing here because of quite a few reviews complaining about editing issues such as showing scenes that don't seem to have a lot of relevance to the story, broccoli, etc. I feel that those types of scenes are needed for some down time so that the viewer can process the various view points and issues being addressed."
I Am a Killer,No Logic at all,"I know each case is different, different lawyers, different states (even if USA is 1 country??), jurors, judges, circumstances etc etc.

But halfway throught the first season, i see a guy in a love triangle gone bad and a weakminded guy trespassing and ending up shooting an old lady, both recieveing a deathrow sentence.

Now i in no way want to judge otherwise, but i am asking if they are a menace to society, will they keep on killing? I think probably not.

Then there is this episode with a underaged guy killing in the name of satan etc bla bla bla, this person gets 40 years because he's to young to get the deathsentence (???) which releases him at around 60 years old and still pretty able to go and kill some more people in the name of satan.

Leaves me to ask which of these 3 guys i fear most and which of them has the best chance of release?

Not god (whatever that is supposted to be) but the law works in mysterious ways....

Overall a good series though, just a very wobbly justicesystem."
I Am a Killer,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","This is such an amazing and exciting idea for a show, but whoever filmed and edited this completely dropped the ball. Instead of focusing on the content of the murderer speaking, they continuously switch to random shots of dramatizations, irrelevant clips, whatever. They actually give significant airtime to the kitchen workers and waiters at the Beef O'Brady's while interviewing a guy there. It's very distracting and completely takes away from the content of the show."
I Am a Killer,Great take on the what makes a killer,"I thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this. Mainly becuase it really digs into the faults of the system, from how a child is left without the proper care growing up to becoming a killer. It's a vicious circle. It is also heartbreaking seeing all the lives destoyed by the deaths of the victims."
Brotherhood,The best reboot,"Fullmetal Alchemist was originally made in 2003 and after 6 years he received one remake following the original Manga.

While the first couple of episodes are done better in the original after the 12 episode the anime just blow up in one of the best writing adventure and history I ever seen. Every character receive a time to shine and the animation is fantastic even after 10 years.

You probably gonna love this."
Brotherhood,"No complaints, seriously. FANTASTIC.","Let's make one thing clear before I start this review, I have no experience with the previous incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist. This series was my first foray into the world of FMA, & I must say, it is VERY excellent.

First off, the series has a huge cast of interesting & unique characters. They are each quite different from each other, and act in different ways. The way the series elegantly manages all the character's developments and story lines is a feat in itself. The series also has a fantastically crafted plot, filled with action, humor, & tragedy. Despite its mainstream appeal, it still maintains a mature tone that really grabs you.

The animation & art is top notch. You won't be getting any poorly edited sequences or grotesque looking art. The production values are great. I watched the series with the English voice track, and the dub did quite a good job. No complaints there. The soundtrack is excellent as well, particularly the opening & closing sequences that accompany each episode.

It goes on for some 64 episodes, & maintains your attention the entire time. It even manages to close everything up in a satisfying manner. A fantastic series. This show will make you laugh, cry, and even get angry a few times.

Loved it."
Brotherhood,So well executed,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is amazing, I love every minute, the characters are great all of them receive a nice development, the voice acting is amazing too both dub and sub are great, animation and the choreography are awesome.

This is perfect series for anime and mainstream fans, just watch."
Brotherhood,Surpasses the original in almost every way,"This review is mainly meant for anyone who watched Fullmetal Alchemist and is either considering Brotherhood, has watched a few episodes and not liked it, or has read one of the negative reviews and was put off.

When I first heard about Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I was skeptical. Seeing as the original Fullmetal Alchemist is the first anime I have ever completely watched and is the spark that ignited my obsessive love of anime that I have today, a redo seemed unnecessary to say the least. What could possibly be improved upon a show as fantastic as Fullmetal Alchemist?

With hesitation and doubt in my heart I started watching the series... and instantly hated it. I won't lie, my first impressions were not only that the show didn't live up to the original, but that it was also an abomination that was dancing on the grave of a greater show.

I cried, I screamed, I broke things, I didn't do any of the above because I'm exaggerating and not actually crazy, but I was still quite upset. The criticisms bubbled up inside me until I was frustratingly glaring at the TV appalled at such changes as Alphonse's voice actor, or a lack of the opening starting with the classic ""in those days, we really believed..."" lines from Al.

With each passing episode the insults to Fullmetal Alchemist seemed to grow, episodes that were lovingly crafted in the original series were apparently being lightly brushed on. Moments in the original that got me hooked fell flat in Brotherhood, and I was fed up and ready to write the letter of complaint to end all letters of complaint. But then, my eyes began to open.

Right around episode 13 where the plot of the two animes separates I started to think that this story might actually be good. As the episodes began to fly I realized that it wasn't good, it was great. After finishing the series I knew without a doubt in my mind that what I had witnessed was my favorite anime of all time. The story of Brotherhood is better than that of the original on so many levels that the two shows truly don't compare. After having my eyes opened I was forced to drop the rating that I gave to the original to an 8 simply because now I knew how much lost potential it had.

If you enjoyed the story of Fullmetal Alchemist, stick with Brotherhood and I guarantee you that you will not regret it. Not only is the plot and storyline vastly improved upon and more satisfying, the animation, music (in my opinion at least, some disagree), characters, and overall feel is far better.

Therefore, if you are a true fan of the original series don't give up on Brotherhood after only a few episodes like I was so tempted to do, it is a show that grows into something that will go down in history as one of the greats of animation history and you shouldn't miss out."
Brotherhood,A review from an NOT anime fan.,"I'm not gonna lie, I don't like animes, seriously since I was a child I never feel any type of interesting from Naruto or Dragon Ball, but this one, oh boy he really put the bar on a really high standard.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is an anime that you can enjoy even without like animes(he really resembles the Avatar for me) the story is so well written I'm impressed with the alchemy a how close is from the actual alchemy, the animation is great, soundtrack is good and after the episode 19 I'm could force me stop watching, the plot is so entertaining that when i finished the last episode my spirit was elevated to the maximum.

While I don't know much of other animes this one is really impressive I definitely recommend."
Brotherhood,This series teaches a class on how to count a story,"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is a masterpiece, it's one of the best series of all time and definitely the best animation I ever watched.

Great action, voice acting and amazing animation. And the philosophy about this show is very powerful.

Overall:9,4/10."
Brotherhood,Just might be the perfect mainstream series,"Fullmetal Alchemist is, in a way, unique. It is very much a mainstream series, with the appeal of a huge cast of unique characters, action that commonly involves special powers, a fairly straight forward story with some mostly obvious symbolism, and a mix of comedy, action, drama, and even some romance. These are all common staples of long running anime series that lean towards a more commercial and public appeal. And yet, for a mainstream series, it manages to continually surprise with a very mature and serious tone. There is a great deal of tragedy and some moments are even frightening and memorable. Few series achieve such a perfect balance of mainstream entertainment and gut wrenching drama and tragedy.

Such was what I discovered when I first laid my eyes on the original FMA series. And yet, for all it's greatness, it began to flounder in it's second season. As many series do, it took on its own form and story, and it was at that point that it started to lose its charm. So, Bones did the smart thing. They remade it. For most series, this would be pointless, but for FMA, it's very much welcome. Five years after the original series ended and the manga has had time to grow, this new FMA is better looking, paced better, and follows the manga, expanding the plot in a better direction.

It's hard not to like anything about this new FMA. The action is fantastic and looks great, as it always did. We aren't subjected to single shots or poorly edited sequences. All the action is displayed and wonderfully animated. Likewise, all the charm is here as well, from the more serious scenes that fans will remember to the humor which is consistent and still funny. Bones took everything good about the original series and threw out all the bad, replacing those particulars with higher quality details. In a sense, it even feels like a new anime, and by episode 13, it has gone in a completely new direction.

A better developed story and characters, superior animation, and fantastic details. These are what make the new FMA an instant new-age classic. Like FMA was the first time around, the new FMA will be one of the top anime to watch out for in the states."
Brotherhood,I can't believe that took me so long to watch this,"""Shounen"" is usually described as being an uninspired genre made for kids, with sub-par watered-down thematic execution and repetitive plot elements.

Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood kills all these notions, it was the grandness a shounen has,but also has the thematic and philosophical crux, which the traditional ""edgy series"" have. The characters grow and develop, the cast is amazing and also is one of the rare Shounens anime that have indeed good female characters, story started simple but grows in a amazing and addictive way. Is smart without being overly dumb, it's a TRUE package that anyone cam enjoy."
Brotherhood,I feel like my spirit is elevated after having just finished the last episode.,"I've seen this show recommended by many sources. Finally I decided to watch it.

At first I was kinda disappointed. The first few episodes didn't make a huge impression on me. But as the story progressed and I got to know more and more fantastically written characters, the backstory started to unfold and alchemy expanded, it just got better and better.

At a point I suddenly found myself addicted to the show. When one episode finished, I immediately started playing the next.

The story deals with morally heavy themes. There is some seriously dark stuff in there. But there is also light. Once you experience terrible things in this show, it is truly cathartic to see some hearthwarmingly good things unfold as well.

This show will make you feel very deep feelings. I have to admit to be crying at some points. It is a true roller-coaster.

You will get so attached to the characters that after the series is over you will seriously miss them. That is a quality of a great show.

The scope of the story is bigger than anything I have ever seen before (no joking, the stakes are bigger than in any other fantasy / sci-fi).

You will find yourself truly rooting for the good guys, worrying about them, and cheering when they seem to succeed in combat against a foe.

If you want to be amazed, addicted, emotionally lifted, press the start button on this show."
Brotherhood,The Best Anime Ever,"Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, I think is the best anime ever made.

First of all the the voice cast were chosen to perfection every voice portrays the character as who the were meant to be.

Secondly The Storyline was so well written compared to the first series. story flows wonderfully as we witness the journey the characters take and the many twists and turns that occur.

Characterization was also excellent. once again I will mention the voices but also the way characters interact with the complex guidelines of the world they inhabit.

And lastly the animation is very fluid no cheap faraway shots where the characters are talking but not moving which is used commonly(see Neon Genesis Evangalion).

I will finish by saying that if you are going to watch one anime in the entirety of your life time Choose Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood."
Brotherhood,Pretty much the best show made in the history of mankind,"Ill explain why this is the best series ever made and why i feel worthy of judging that.

*Note that English isn't my native tongue* I've been addicted to series for like... forever. I could probably list at least 50 full series I've seen from all kinds.

If i told myself 10 years ago or so that the best series i would ever see was an Anime i wouldn't have believed it.

This series made me laugh out loud, cry and bring up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The characters and story are pretty much flawless and there is little to none loose ends. There isn't a ""stormy"" story curve as many series suffer from - where the intro - mid part or ending is to short , to long or rushed. The pace through the entire anime is good.

The series does not suffer either from things like to slow riddles-to-answers rate (Lost *cough*) or to fast story.

All characters are developed in a brilliant way through the series.

Of all movies and shows I've seen in my lifetime - if i would have to recommend one single series to someone it would be this one without hesitation.

If i had an enemy i hated in real life more than anything - even i wouldn't be so cruel as to deny that person to see this show. I could deny them food instead and it would be merciful. Thats how good this show is.

One thing that was a major concern early on was that this show would be to childish and silly. Don't be deceived, it is very mature and some elements are even horrifying.

This is one of the only shows I've ever seen, where i haven't been able to personally come up with better ideas on how to make it.

Perfection.

See it.

I also recommend original Japanese voices with English text for best experience."
Brotherhood,"Losing my interest about halfway through, but -did- enjoy it.","It's waring on my patience, the more character's that get introduced, the pointless conversations, -completely- pointless sub-plots. It feels like a lot of this show is either localized in an incredibly contrived way, or there's quite a lot of filler.

Still, I really enjoyed the first 2 seasons (or Parts as Netflix is calling them) and due to the love this series has gotten I'll keep trying to watch. Not a -true- anime fan - I like Bebop, NG:E, Akira, took the chance on this and loved the charm and bounciness of the the plot of this show. I'll edit this if my opinon changes in some major way."
Brotherhood,A Fantastic Reboot,"Having been an avid fan of the first Fullmetal Alchemist series, i was highly apprehensive on hearing about this reboot, but the more i found out about the series, the more excited i became. I've always been a fan of the Manga, and the new series is being based completely of the manga storyline. This had be hooked, so i waited nervously for the first episode.

The new series features better artwork that resembles Arakawa's style more closely than the last series. There is more humour, especially Ed transmuting a spear-head into his face. There is a new soundtrack, which admittedly, at times doesn't work greatly, but with some getting used too, i'm sure it will grow on me. Overall, i feel this series is a fantastic reboot, and is verging on turning Fullmetal Alchemist into the series it should always have been."

Brotherhood,It's better than the OG one? yes but some flaws too still 8/10,Comentario no disponible
Brotherhood,Best of all Anime and better than the earlier version,"I have seen both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood) and both are good. In the first version (Fullmetal Alchemist), the first half of the series is really good. The fight between Edward Elric & Roy Mustang and the State Alchemist test taken by Edward Elric are notable ones. In second half, the story takes lots of twists and turns and I find it's not as impressive as the first half.

The second version (Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) is sticking to manga and has the soul of the original story. It is an all-rounded anime with tightly knit fantastic story, humorous, action packed, dark at times and entertaining. In first half, character introduction, funny moments, action sequence, ends with almost no hope situation for our heroes. In second half, the story takes it's fast pace with more action and nail biting moments.

The decisions/resolutions taken by the Elric brothers at each step of their journey are clearly justified. All characters had their importance in the series, even the cute little panda and Yogi had their importance in moving the story forward. Usually when a character is introduced in the middle of a series, it stay far too superior/inferior to rest of the characters. But I like the way Olivier Mira Armstrong and Lin Yao gang introduced in the series.

Sometimes when I think of watching something, I start with any one particular scene in this series and ended up watching till the very end of the series. I don't remember how many times I watched it.

I have seen many anime in all genre (comedy, drama, action, adventure, thriller, slice of life, bloody ones, etc.) and in my opinion, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is the best in overall. So I give 10 out of 10.

When people asks me to suggest something to watch, I recommend this series without blinking. Either they say Animation is for kids or series are lengthy to watch without knowing how Japanese anime differs from Western animation. I would say one thing, watch at least couple of episodes and then you will understand why I recommend this series.

Suggestion: The first episode is more of an quick introduction of main casts. The actual story starts in episode 2. So it is OK to skip episode 1. Japanese audio is better than English audio.

Other suggested Animes: Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Code Geass, Steins Gate, Hunter X Hunter, Attack on Titans, Samurai Champloo, Great Teacher Onizuka, Parasyte, One Punch Man (season 1), Boku no Hero Academia, Ghost in the shell (both movies & series, have complex plot), Shigurui (only adults, watch only if you are OK with violence & sex)"
Brotherhood,A Well Made Story.,"First let me say that the music/OSTs in this anime are just magnificent, there is not even one single bad opening! Every opening them is just so perfect that you can't stop listening to it! The background music is so goated! My favorite op is the 5th op ""Rain"" by SID and it's actually my all time favorite anime op, the greatest opening ever. But other than that the ""Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" story about two brothers and their journey to try to get their bodies back is a perfect storytelling, with a great writing to every character and a really good characters design and a nice world building plus a fine animation. Something that I really like about this anime is that how they show you all this things about the military and how you can't trust people no matter who they are and all this thing with the dogs of the military etc... I also like the philosophy in this anime but I don't want to say too much here, so if you really wanna know what I'm talking about search on YouTube ""The Philosophy of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood"" there is a video there by ""Wisecrack"", I recommend you to watch it if you've already finished the anime."
Brotherhood,Fantastic.,"I have seen the entirety of the Full Metal Alchemist series that was produced in 2004. The series has a sizable cast which are unique and interesting in their own way. They all have specific characteristics which make them stand out from each other and sometimes oppose each other with their philosophies. This series does things that may others attempt to do. They manage to develop the characters and their story lines in a very beautiful manner. This series has one of the best plots that I have ever witnessed with just the right amount of action, humour and tragedy all excellently blended together to create a plot that keeps you wanting more from start to finish."
Brotherhood,Review from Fmab,Comentario no disponible
Brotherhood,"The Anime Equivalent of a ""Passing"" Grade","FMAB is good and checks all the boxes, a plot that makes sense, good characters, some good character arcs, and good worldbuilding. However I feel it doesn't do anything truly 'amazing'.

Is it the most gripping story ever told? Does it have an amazing score? Phenomenal voice acting? No - watch AOT instead

Does it have the coolest characters? No - watch Code Geass instead

Does it have the greatest animation ever? No - watch Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen

This anime is the definition of checking all the boxes, meeting all expectations, but never going above and beyond. I can tepidly recommend this, but I can't say I really loved it."
Brotherhood,Meh...,"I just can't get why people love this series so much?

I watched the original series as well, and this also. I loved the original and everyone told me this is way better.

All I see there is cheap animation (still frames all the time for minutes), music without any emotions, fast shots, each dramatic moment just screwed up by bad decisions like chibi animation and funny music. It kills the mood all the time.

The characters making silly decisions, everyone is brainless. I feel I do not care anyone, the whole story is just kids play, without emotional struggles. It has no weight after all. At the end I felt I do not care who will win, what will happen, because it is happening because the heroes just screwed things up, so it is the minimum that they will fix it. Each character is the same mass without any characteristics (only a few exceptions).

I really tried to like this, I have seen many anime worse than this but I can rate it just as ""meh..""."

Brotherhood,Still a loved one world,"**English is not my first language**

After more than a decade, this story is still one of my loved one sagas of all times. The world building, the drama, the - so human - themes and the characters (all characters!) are the strength core of it. Plus, we have a very good animation, a impressive tied plot and pace, gorgeous music and the ten last episodes that takes your breath away.

It has a world with its own laws and unique landscape and lore, that could be expanded on and on.

Fullmetal is one of my loved one stories of all time, side by side with the worlds of Middle Earth, Westeros, Hogwarts and the whole Star Wars drama."

Audrie & Daisy,Gut-wrenching look at the effects of online bullying,"The internet is populated an endless amount of dangers that sadly not enough teenagers today know about, and the effects of falling into these traps can be devastating. You look at social media websites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr; and see teenagers online sharing sweet moments in ways of communicating with one another. Unfortunately, social media has also been used as a weapon to attack or humiliate one another, and suicide or suicide attempts are not uncommon results; especially if you can recount the Megan Meier incident back in 2006 or the story of Tyler Clementi in 2010. This documentary directed by Bonni Cohen and John Shenk paints an honest picture on the effects of date rape and the resulting online bullying associating with a story of two teenager who fell victim to these humiliating acts. One story recounts of 15-year old Audrie Pott, a girl from Saratoga, California who was sexually assaulted while drunk at a party and subject to pictures posted online, a heinous act that resulted in her committing suicide. Then there's a second story covering 14-year old Daisy Colemon, a girl from Maryville, Missouri who along with her friend Paige was date raped and subsequently became a target of online harassment, along with her parents. These stories are both told through interviews of the victims and their families, police investigations, social media, and following court cases.

It is generally hard to reach the end of this documentary and not fill your head with thoughts of how innocent little girls can fall victim to such horrible acts by their peers, and concerns of how vulnerable your kids could be (if you're a parent) to becoming a target of humiliating activity like this; and listening to these stories about these girls is quite gut-wrenching. And the saddest part is these kinds of stories are not rare, they happen more than everyone knows. The problem this documentary covers is not just the vulnerability of rape by sex-thirsty young men who use alcohol as a key to take advantage of helpless adolescent girls, but also how teenagers nowadays are not educated enough on the dangers that lie in the social realm and the perils of online social media. Then the more absurd aspects involve how the parents become victims of online scrutiny by the public who were intent on shaming the victims rather than sympathizing with them. And by all means, it is sad to watch. But overall, there is an astounding triumph that the victims and their families end up reaching when the girls learn they must speak out publicly and help stand up for other who have been affected. Though these stories are often told a bit unevenly as the majority of the film seems to go further in depth on the Daisy Colemon story, its still remains interesting to where you may shed some tears in some parts, then by the end cheer for the justice they reach.

Audrie & Daisy is an honest, unbiased documentary that is very gut-wrenching, but at the same time very important for not only parents, but also for teenagers to watch. It is a documentary that I believe is powerful enough to educate teenagers on the dangers that lie in the world of socializing and remind them of the morally gray figures that lie within their community. One of the most important lessons teenagers can learn is that they can get hurt if they do not make smart choices."
Audrie & Daisy,Many emotions try you when watching this,"Apart from being so sad and heartbreaking, it is far more than a simple documentary. It is a life lesson that many aren't aware of. It is something you are never taught in school, although similar things happen around you often. ""Taboo"" would be the word for this case. I can not believe that in ours today society we still face problems like this. And what's more disturbing is the fact that no action is taken by those who have the power to do something in this sense, leaving the ""wounded"" with scars on their souls and, even worse, with the accusation that they are liars and came intentionally with this bs just to be given attention."
Audrie & Daisy,Important & Horrifying Documentary,"A tragic and infuriating documentary about two teenage girls who first faced sexual assault and then became pariahs (along with their families) for having the audacity to anger one of the city's most important families. But the most disgusting part of this film deal with the horrid sheriff slut-shaming the victims while defending the rapists because, hey, boys will be boys and the girls asked fro it anyway. The fact that creeps such as this still hold positions of power in this country, albeit a conservative part of the country, is even more disheartening. The fact that some find a documentary about two, victimized teenage girls 'liberal propaganda'...well, these are the ones with political agendas that ignores the facts. People who explain away rape and humiliation of teen girls are potential offenders in my opinion. A must-see for parents and their children say 12 and up."
Audrie & Daisy,MUST WATCH! This movie makes my blood boil!,Comentario no disponible
Audrie & Daisy,Should be mandatory viewing in schools...,"In some ways the most horrifying aspects of this film are not the details of what happened but the aftermath. In the case of Daisy Coleman, the community and local law enforcement colluded to shield the young men and shame and exclude the Coleman family. The Sheriff all but stated the two girls were somehow equally responsible for what happened and that Melinda Coleman was nutty. In the case of Audrey Potts the two main participants came across as completely lacking in remorse of understanding. At one point on of the two young men involved in the Potts assault says the biggest thing he learned out of the experience was that ""girls gossip and boys are more laid back"". Most people with any empathy will want to punch both the Mayor and Sheriff in the face. Maryville Missouri looks like a pretty corrupt place. The Potts lost their daughter and the reality is assaults against young women especially when alcohol is involved happen every day.

The one hopeful thing that comes out of this is that Coleman, the Potts family and others have all become advocates for others."

Audrie & Daisy,left speechless,"I don't know what hits me more.. the apology of one of the guys that included that he learned ""that girls gossip a lot more & guys are more laid back""? or the maryland prosecutor dropping the charges? the police-man's comment saying the girl was as much at fault as the guy? or the bullying? or the maryland politician (?) asking why the media explodes about this but doesn't report that they built a lake and golf course being under the best 100 in america?

...or some of the comments on here criticizing 'the condescending tone' in the documentary and questioning the 'agenda' of making it...

i am thunderstruck, at loss for words.."

Audrie & Daisy,Dumbest sherrif,You can literally see the guy deleting the video and stuff in the footage of the interview. He gives it back to the suspect so he can delete it... Seems like the sherrif was not that Keen to stop him and only after letting him tap on the screen for a bit goes to check what is happening. Im curious how long it took him in unedited footage.
Audrie & Daisy,A MUST-Watch for (1) Parents & (2) Teenage Girls,"As the father of a little girl, I recommend parents everywhere to watch this movie. This movie addresses the sad reality that many teenage girls in the United States (Yes, right under our noses) are being sexually assaulted by none other than their classmates or male friends. And due to political or peer pressure reasons, these cases are often dismissed... and the girls ignored--sometimes, even bullied and condemned as liars."
Audrie & Daisy,Terrible,"And I'm not talking about the documentary, but what has happened and still happens to a degree and not just in America. There are many perks of social media and the overall online community. But there is also a lot of bad stuff that has come with the good. But this is more of a side story to what really matters: The attacks and the way society in general handles those.

There have been false claims of course, but when clear cut cases like this get handled like this ... It really is annoying to say the least and should get people mad. When you hear people complaining that the boys have it tough and their careers shouldn't be ruined, you wonder why they are painted the victims. It's heart breaking to see the girls who have been mistreated - twice or even multiple times. The one is the physical attack, but if that wasn't enough, the psychological consequences are far worse. This shines a light on that and hopefully opens people awareness of this issue ... An important documentary, that may have been able to have some stronger message overall, but still is powerful enough and could be used in schools and classes for educational purposes"

Audrie & Daisy,Torn between the show show agenda and the meaning.,"There is nothing wrong with the movie. I found it very interesting that they actually interviewed the men involved. But the show had a very Condescending tone the whole time. People always say that this should be shown in schools, but these things are not caused from ignorance of this subject. It's the growing pains of adolescence and the apathy towards the repercussions involving the law. But I'm concerned why Netflix wanted to publish this. With their posting of 'dear white people' and many other liberal identity politics shows and movies. I can't take the reasons of the show being posted seriously. Because people never want to learn from these experiences and take it on a case by case basis. Everything about this seemed to be a rape culture testament when its not."

The great Maryville sheriff, Darren White, and Maryville mayor Jim Fall believe ""It's not always the boys. Girls have as much culpability"" among many other issues with Daisy's case...

RIP Audrie and Daisy.

Audrie & Daisy,Burn in hell Maryville,"Absolutely shocking to watch this.

This town destroyed lives, destroyed families and the stupidest man I have ever seen is actually the sheriff! Unbelievable!

The way he brushes off everything got me so mad, how can any town elect this idiot!!!

As a grown man that likes to think he is very manly this documentary made me cry, I have watched it a couple of times, I watched it again after I read about the tragedies that have happened to Daisy and her family since this was made, absolutely heart breaking.

With Audrie I have no idea why a family has to fight for justice for what happened to her!! Justice should be there for her!!

Then listening to the losers that attacked her being so relaxed about it and going on about how guys are more relaxed than girls.... hopefully these guys have nothing but misery in their lives!

Audrie and Daisy 2 beautiful girls both inside and out. R. I. P.

Please watch this documentary and let your older kids watch it too, educating the younger generation is the way forward, don't let them grow up with the attitude of that brain dead sheriff."

Team Kaylie,Acting not good,"Cheesy script, poor acting and line execution. It's trying to be like 2010 Disney but it's somehow worse lol. None of the characters are super likeable either. If you wanna watch a better family show, try Alexa and Katie on Netflix. It's a bit more bearable than this."
Team Kaylie,Waste of Time,"Disgusting acting, disgusting plots, terrible jokes. Horribly horrific show."
Team Kaylie,Headache material,If you want a headache this is the show for you! None of the characters are likeable and the entire show is ham acting at its best. So over the top with jokes that aren't even funny and half of the actors put on ridiculous voices. Cringe
Team Kaylie,"One of the worst and daresay, cancerous shows in the world","All the characters are vapid and annoying, you lose 200 brain cells every minute you watch this. And most of the ""humor"" is derived from potty jokes and refrences; would rather watch Shark Tale than this mess; so predictable."
Team Kaylie,Horrible show,"This show is not a role model for kids, I can't believe they made this."
Team Kaylie,Abysmal,"This show is absolutely horrendous, even for a Netflix sitcom for kids. Seriously I've seen better on the Disney channel. You might watch it and think that the humour isn't so bad, but then you realize that these jokes have been told a billion times before this. The humour is basic and the show is appalling. Would not recommend"
Team Kaylie,Ridiculously funny show!,"This show is ridiculously funny. It's one of the better comedy series I've seen on Netflix in a while and it's honestly on par with series like Jessie. I'm really excited for more episodes to drop out of the 20-episode initial order. I don't have high hopes the series will be renewed for a season two, but a person can be hopeful. Also, a series like this is what I initially expect to be on networks like Disney Channel, mainly because Disney is typically known for series like this, like (again) Jessie, which was one of my favorite comedy series too before it ended its run back in 2015. Netflix honestly needs more series like this! :)"
Team Kaylie,Vapid.,"Taking a page from the Kardashians, this show tries so hard to be cool and hip. But more like a hip that needs replacing. The main character is shallow, pedantic and ridiculously obnoxious. Do not let your children watch this, lest they think this is how to be. How did this ever get made? With actors whose performances are more hated than John WIlkes Boothe's at Ford's Theater in April of 1865. Save your brain cells, skip this."

LEGO City,The best LEGO show,"I love Legoes because there's so much you can make and do with them. It's no surprise that I adore The Lego Movie (and its sequel) and The Lego Batman Movie. Lego City Adventures shows a lot of potential and is the best LEGO TV show to date.

The premise is very intriguing. Although the stories are mostly self-contained, the show revolves around the citizens of Lego City trying to stop a master criminal, meaning there's an overarching plot (somewhat). I like that the arc is subtle, similar to TOTS and Amphibia.

Another thing I like about the show is the fact that it focuses on a bunch of characters rather than just one. It's a very good thing, as it allows the show's rich and diverse cast of characters to have a chance to shine. There's the overly heroic cop Sgt. Duke DeTain, crisis-ready fire Chief Freya McCloud, grumpy street sweeper Shirley Keeper, among others. They all have unique and deep personalities. The focus on many kinds of everyday heroes also gives me Higglytown Heroes and Rescue Heroes vibes.

The dialogue is very clever, there are several good morals like ""Sometimes, you can't always stay exactly on schedule"", and the animation and FX are well done. If you like Legoes, Rescue Heroes, and/or Higglytown Heroes, this show is for you. Definitely the most underrated Nickelodeon show right now!"
LEGO City,Underrated,"I came across this show completely by accident. But good gosh am I glad that I did! This show is filled to the brim with clever writing, charming stories, and lovable characters! Lego sort of has a reputation for making good animated content (i.e Lego movie, Lego Batman movie, ninjago). But the disappointing thing about this one us the fact that no one seems to be talking about it! This is easily my favorite thing airing on Nickelodeon. Which says alot, because I love loudhouse. But Lego city adventures just has to much more to love!"
LEGO City,Needs more attention!,"This show is extremely underrated it has many lovable characters! The show has good humour in it. It's not like the other shows where when a episode happens they forget the changes on what happened, plus you don't have to watch the other episodes to watch the next one, except the special. They also give us hints on the upcoming events that will happen, and they show us more about the characters in it. You must watch this show! It's very underated! This really needs more attention!"
LEGO City,TALK ABOUT IT !!,"I don't know where to start? I found out about this show in October 2019 and ever since .. i made it my NON STOP MISSION to get people to give it a chance .. I fell in LOVE with this show and it's characters... Lego City adventures is a pleasure to watch, re-watch over and over, I would always find something new in my re-watch. the comedy hit me ALL the time, it's a perfect mix of absurd and unpredictable. it fits my humor so much that in several occasion, I had to take breaks from episodes I was watching to catch my breath ! that tells a lot ! sometimes I would feel down or exhausted and re watch some episodes and I would be okay again. this show REALLY makes me happy to know and share about .. ALL characters are adorable and some of them even remind me of myself . it is a REAL shame that outside of a group of fans I've met, no one seems to be talking about it ??? LCA is such a unique concept and watching these characters grow in front of me is something that i don't think, will ever get tired off <3"
LEGO City,Funniest damn show I've seen in years!,This show makes me laugh so hard! I laugh every 10 seconds! The plots are also interesting and the music is good. This show is overall one of the best modern Nickelodeon shows.
LEGO City,"Lego City Adventures, A Flawless Mastercraft","Lego City Adventures is really when Martin Scorsese started getting serious with his film-making. While his early works like Raging Bull and Casino were just a bit too pedestrian and pedantic for me, Lego City Adventures is when he decided to start taking things seriously. The character arcs you will see unfold in this show are deeper than most long running TV shows can attain. Overall, Lego City Adventures will bring you into a new realm, with world building better than the best of Tolkien's work. Funny story, Vince Gilligan of AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" actually sent a personally addressed letter to Scorsese upon finishing this masterclass of storytelling. He wrote ""nice, Lego"" which would directly inspire him to create Better Call Saul 3 years later. And that kid that got the letter? She would grow up to become Ariana Grande.

Overall, a master class of storytelling and world building. Bravo, Scorsese."

Blood Pact,Many series fall short...,"...in the Netflix era, but this one stands out. Best TV series since BB en Better call Saul. The acting is at a very high level and the characters are not black and white but complex. The main bad guy is as much victim as he is criminal. He wants to be a good husband and father. But his past keeps him hostage, he is blackmailed so he has to blackmail others. As cinephile I think this brilliant series deserves world wide attention. Is it perfect? No but I have not seen one lame episode. Van Derwig and Atsma are pretty brilliant"
Blood Pact,Gripping and well-made,"Klem is a gripping Dutch thriller series featuring an acclaimed cast. The story line is credible, and the unease of the initially very innocent tax official - who is slowly sucked into more criminal enterprises - is relatable. Portrayal of Amsterdam upper and lower/criminal class is accurate, and the accents spot on."
Blood Pact,"Great, Rare Qulaity Show","Dutch TV is new to me but Klem is a real credit.

Twisting plot, strong characters, great acting.

Advertising inserted at odd times, slightly dodgy translation mean I cannot give Klem a 10 but roll on series 4!"
Blood Pact,Bravo to Entire Team!,Comentario no disponible
Blood Pact,Decent watch,Watched the first series a couple of years ago and just discovered to my delight there are another 2 on all4 (uk).
Blood Pact,Brilliant,"I loved this drama, absolutely brilliant, loved every episode, loads of twists, turns and suprises kept me watching, was sad when it ended. Definitely recommend."
Blood Pact,Much better then I suspected,"It took some time to set the stage but once the relations were established it got under my skin and I just kept on watching. Really rooting for the characters and hoping they could solve their problems. I am dutch and am always very critical on dutch series. But this is a quality series worth the watch. And I think also people outside the Netherlands will enjoy it. No over the top action and I found the story to be believable witch also is a big plus. Also the children do a good job (normally I can't stand children in series...) It even brought tears to my eyes in some cases.

I give Klem an 8 out of 10."
Blood Pact,"Exciting show, skip the fourth year!","Where a dull ""taxman"" finds himself drawn into the criminal world of murder and fraud. Script has some flaws, but if you're not too critical, it works. Jacob Derwig as the dumb and aggressive criminal is awesome!

The fourth year however, is over the top, with a very weak and ridiculous script. Skip it, cause it has nothing to do with the first three years."
Blood Pact,Not bad at all...,For Dutch standards this is not bad at all. Definitely much better than GTST 🙄
Blood Pact,Amateur script and plot devices,"Yeah, it's OK, but I'm not a fan of tension being portrayed via stupid awkward unrealistic human interactions.

If realistic human nature is what you value / need in a drama, then you'll struggle with this one."
Blood Pact,A Gripping Dutch Drama,"Klem, a Dutch series, earns a remarkable 9/10 from me for its thrilling storyline and captivating performances, especially that of Marius Milner. Milner, in particular, exudes a compelling 'bad boy' vibe that adds a layer of intensity and complexity to the show.

The series is exceptionally engaging, with a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's the kind of show that has you glued to the screen, eagerly anticipating what will happen next. The suspense is skillfully built up, creating an atmosphere that is both tense and exciting.

What makes Klem stand out is how it combines elements of drama and suspense with well-developed characters. Marius Milner's portrayal is particularly noteworthy he brings a gritty realism to his role, making his character's journey all the more intriguing."
Blood Pact,Regretted the hours spent watching,"Series one and two are very well scripted, acted and filmed. Each episode portrays greed corruption in diametrically opposed families with violence threats and murder and ends with a cliff hanger. Whilst some of the really bad guys are cardboard cut outs the main characters have well defined weaknesses.

Unfortunately series three turns into a completely unrealistic comedy caper with robbery and violence, with corrupt Milner and Warmond now ' heroes' saved just in time over and over again before a fairy tale ending. So if you must keep watching just go along and be glad that for some, crime can pay. Great to hear English obscenities peppering the script. Smatterings of romance and sex as required. From complex beginnings the final episodes become ludicrous."
Blood Pact,Too many holes,"Decent effort but not execution, could have been done in half the episodes. They drop in a dark comedy spin to it but (curiously) only in the last episode so that doesn't work, either. The story is decent but the script is not. Dialogue seems almost forced, nobody's a believable character."

One on One,Duane + Flex made the show,"i think kelly, the guy who played duane is a underrated actor. i liked him on one on one, in fact kelly was my favorite actor on the show.

i really think he needs another TV show. i know he had under one roof, but the premise storyline wasn't a keeper. But kelly did good job acting.

When he and spirit were let go on one on one, the show went downhill fast. spirit kept interest between the boring briana and arnez saga.

one on ones last season, which excluded flex, duane and spirit, was focused strictly on the teen audience and tried to pump itself as hip, when in fact it was giving itself a bullet to the head. it failed! Duane and flex kept the show neutral in the age brackets, a little for everyone.

Briana alone with arnaz in California was just boring. i knew the writers were gonna break them up 1st episode. Friends ripoff? thanks kelly for the laughs, you got more laughs from me than anyone on show.

my best to you"
One on One,BRILLIANT N REALISTIC!,I love this show. It isn't a cheesy show that always has a message but it is hilarious and Kyla is a great actress and I'd love to see her in otha films and shows.Good show and you have to watch it if you enjoy other teen sitcoms and even if you don't.

One on One,I love this show!,"A womanizer ex basketball player now sports announcer Flex Washington has his teenage daughter Briana Barnes move in with him and he has to make changes in his life to be the best role model for her. This show was comical, emotional, and educational.

The last season when Arnaz & Briana went to LA for college seem out of place and I wish they could at least shown Spirit point of view as well."
One on One,How was this made? Let alone for 5 seasons!?,"I will admit that I didn't watch too many episodes of this but for the few I did watch I thought they were terrible. The so-called scripts are laughable, the acting is atrocious, and the basic plots are snore-worthy! This has got to be the worst show that has ever been on for 5 years! I cannot understand how this even became a pilot let alone have over 100 episodes. I cannot understand what possible appeal this has to anyone. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that has two eyes and ears. I had watched this when there was nothing else on, and thanks to this show I have started reading a lot more than I have in the past. Whatever you do don't waste your time with this absolute drivel!"
One on One,Great,"This is my favourite television series. I absolutely love 'One on One'. The cast are great, especially Kyla Pratt and Flex Alexander. The only problem is I cannot seem to be able to purchase a video of the series from anywhere. Which is a real shame. I love this show and can't wait to see how things turn out! I really miss it when the series is over!

The entire cast perform one hundred and ten per cent in every episode, which is great to see. Breanna is by far my favourite character! She's fiesty, pretty and just plain likable! I think Sicily is a great actress too and I think she could go very far. This series is great and I just can't wait for the new season to start!"
One on One,This show really deserves its flowers,"The acting is great, the show is moderately progressive (especially for the times) and the laughs that fill my belly from watching this show almost 20 years later is amazing. The whole team, y'all did it!"
One on One,"Personally, the person who commented this above me, is wrong.","I love this show. I am 14 years old, so I can relate to the jokes and catches that the show has. It deals with a teenage girl just trying to survive in life. Its a funny show, and that other person has no idea what he/she is talking about. UHM HELLO!?! If a show was awful, how could it run for 5 seasons. Also, it has to deal with a middle-aged man trying to raise a teenage daughter by himself. What is more entertaining!? I'm not saying it was the best show everr, I am just sayingg it was worth the while. Well for me this show is on in like an hour, so I am going to go watch it.! Good job guys, I love this show. Take care guys, and if you get the chance, I know that it is on at like 3 a.m on the channel The-N. ITS A CHANNEL FOR TEENS! (:"
One on One,help me find the DVD's,i love this show so much i really want to find the season on DVD so i can see all of them. so if any one knows how i can find them to buy them let me know please. i really love this show. but i have school and it is usually on at like 3am here and i cant always be up to watch them. please help me. i really love this show. my boyfriend and i love to watch one on one. we even got on of our good friends in to it to. it bring life matter's in to the show. flex is single and taking care of a kid and has to keeep up with his work and trying to find the right person. so i think it is good for all ages to watch this show. it will show them them real life and how to reaise kids buy your self.
One on One,Can't decide...,"Sometimes this show is good, other times it'a bad. Most of the time bad.

The first set of series are just terrible. All it is is a rude, ignorant girl from Atlanta or wherever moving in with her supposedly famous dad. Brianna is just a rude girl who doesn't care about anyone else's feelings, but still gets lots of boyfriends? That, I don't understand.

But as the show's gone on, Brianna has gotten nicer. One thing that I hate about the show, is the racial comments they make. No, I'm not a white person who you might call ""racist"", I'm just a mixed-race girl (half black, half white). And sometimes Spirit says passing comments about Arnaz being half black, half white, and the whole audience burst out laughing. I really don't understand that ... Basically the shows giving the impression that it's OK to be like that, which I consider racist. But who, who watches the show, will agree with that? Most people believe it's OK for black people to make racial stereotypes and be racist anyway.

The second last series were good: When a nice, decent woman (Danielle) came and she was probably the only heartfelt person in the show. Everyone else seems like they only care about themselves.

In my opinion, only chavs (Americans won't know what that word means, but it isn't a compliment) will enjoy this show because it's a show about chavs. Although I don't like the racial comments Spirit makes, she does make girls who aren't like the pretty, popular girls like Brianna feel better because it makes them know that they're not alone.

I'd only watch this show if there was nothing else on TV to watch, then it is a good show. I wouldn't exactly cry if I knew that I'd missed it.

Oh, and the fact that Brianna lost her virginity to the guy who Ray J plays in the end, after Arnaz has been begging for her virginity for years was just stupid!"
One on One,DVD or what,I love this show and i would love the seasons to be on DVD does anyone know if the show is on DVD and if u do someone let me know. I am crazy about this show. I love this show and if there is a DVD i would love to know. Also if there isn't a DVD then the studio should make one. people love this show and i would watch it all day if i could. So if anyone knows let me know. They should make a DVD i wish they would continue the show. it is so worth it. I wish this show was on all day i would watch it for sure. Breanna and arnez are so aborable and they belong together. I am new to the show and i have not seen all eposides. Unfortuneltly i know they break up but by the series end i hope they get back together.
One on One,Watch,Really want to watch this series but the app or website won't let me do so
One on One,Brilliant show,"Ok, I know I say this type of thing in all of my comments, but this show is actually brilliant! Totally funny, and realistic too, not like other tv programmes, most programmes try to be funny and realistic at the same time, but have never managed to acomplish this until now, it deals with real issues and not fake ones which you find on other programmes theese days, I really do reccomend this show, and I have only watched 3 episodes so far, it really does grow on you, so watch it more than once before you go out dissing it, because you may change you're mind and will regret what you have said. 97% for the show."
One on One,Pretty good,Comentario no disponible
One on One,The best show in the UPN lineup on Monday nights!,"One on One is a smart, and comedic show about a bachelor, Flex Washington raising her witty, sexy, and sometimes trouble making teenage daughter Briaana.(I would definitely like to meet her one day, KYLA RIVERS in the future, remember that!!) The show is original, and has many experienced stars. Kyla Pratt(Briaana) has been in many shows and movies such as Docter Dolittle 1 and 2. Flex's friend, Dwayne has been in many shows as well. Don't forget Flex's ex-wife who played Pam on the popular series, Martin. Overall watch this very funny show."
One on One,"BEST TV program yet! If you haven't seen it yet, quick you better get a view of it or believe me, you will be kicking yourself!!","One day i was flicking through the channels on the TV, when i stopped on the program 'One on One' after viewing this for about 2min it became my fave program! It is a funny and REALISTIC teen comedy that captures how life really is, in the BEST possible way. In every episode of 'One on One' something brill is bound to happen, that will make you continue to watch the program the next day. The comedy is outstanding and will make you laugh for hrs, the cast is the 'bomb' no other actors could play the parts so well! I would strongly recommend this comedy, fantastic program, outstanding program or what ever you want to call it! I promise that you will be glad you tuned in!!

One on One,Great to see high-quality Afro-American TV,"First off, let me point out that I am a white male who grew up in East-Cambridge, MA. It was a very multicultural neighborhood. SO as you can imagine I had plenty of multcultural friends. As a child I loved to watch shows like The Jeffersons, Good Times, Cosby Show, In Living Colour, etc. These were all good shows. But some were criticized becuase they were too stereotypical and oddly some were criticized for not being ""accurate"" enough. Such as the Cosby Show. I used to ask my friends why can't people make up their minds? Do they want Black people portrayed as ghetto gang bangers in movies like South Central or like high society annunciaters (white people in black people's bodies) like the Cosby Show? They usually looked at me and laughed. After all how do you answer such a Sociological-Philosophical question. Well, anyways, then in the mid-90's came the WB and UPN networks. At first their shows stunk like FOX did in the late 80's and most of the 90's. And then they found their audience! Young people in Urban areas. My kind of neighborhood. At first I jokingly called them ""Average Black People Shows"". But that sounded ambiguously racist so now I say A.B.P.S. LOL!! They're basically Shows Like Moesha, Parkers, Sisters, which starred Brandy and Diana Ross's daughter (name escapes me). And several others which names I forgot, but they starred Robin Givens, Alfonsa Rivera, Malcolm Jamal Warner, and other African Americans from TOP NBC, CBS, and ABC shows from the 80's and 90's. At first it was GREAT to see them working again, but then it got weird. After all some of the shows still stunk. Mostly the writing and obvious cheap budgets. I mean just look at Homeboys in Outer Space!! Although, I liked others such as the Parent Hood which should STILL be on the air today!! I guess what I am trying to say is I like One on One. It is a good show. It is one of many of those A.B.P.S.'s that are on the air today on the WB and UPN early in the week. Both networks have improved ALOT these past 2 or 3 years and so have their programming, writing, budget and actors are great. Keep up the good work Flex and never do anything like Homeboys in outer space again!! It wasn't"
One on One,Realistic,"This series is a very realistic series unlike some I've seen. The acting could use a little more effort but it is a great, comedic show for the entire family as it tackles real issues. Breanna played by Kyla Pratt (Dr. Dolittle) is funny but sometimes her character is pushed to being too funny to a point where she is just not funny and very annoying. Her dad portrayed by Flex Alexander (Out Cold) is also very funny. His character is trying to raise his daughter without spoiling her and that can relate to many people. The show is nice. I watch it as often as I can and I give it *** out of *****."
One on One,Angell As Amanda = Awesome Acting!,"The performance by actress Angell Conwell was comical, cute and classy. She played a 21 year old believingly as well as a 17 year old believingly, in the same episode ""2 Young & 2 Curious"" last night. Her range has no boundaries. I've seen her play both classy and ghetto and she really rocks. That's what you call ACTING. Congrats to the Producers, Director and Casting of One On One for having the EYES for true talent. There is hope for Hollywood. As a writer myself, it's good to know that TRUE TALENTED Actors still have a shot at the good roles."

Are You Afraid of the Dark?,"so many episodes, so little time!","Are You Afraid of the Dark was a favorite for anyone who was a kid aged between 5 or 6 to mid teens (maybe older even) when it was on starting in 1992. It served as a special point in the original SNICK Saturday night programming, as it was the last show to air before the channel reverted to TVLAND programming. Even when an episode didn't entirely work or was too goofy for its own good (and there were a few times, lets admit it fans), there was always a sense of excitement and anticipation to see where the next scary story would head next at that time of night before bed. Some of the essentials were the movie theater episode (Nosferatu, anyone? who hasn't wanted to go through the screen from this episode); the one that sticks quite prominently involving a clown in an amusement park (his nose!); ones with big doses of tongue-in-cheek (dark) humor like with the comic-book villain posed very much like the Joker; even a trippy one, like with the see-through glasses that featured figures of death ala Bergman.

There were many others, feeding directly into phobias and other ticks that held some kids in a panic, or at least interest, if presented right in the episode. And even the gimmick of the Midnight Society was not too old fashioned; having kids tell stories around a campfire, proving worth of the member based on how good the story could get, was essential to making this not only about how scary a story could get, but about the act of storytelling itself. Can a kid get rightfully engrossed and shaking in their shoes in half an hour? Would the cliffhangers give enough leverage to stay through the commercials? If memory serves me right, most of the episodes that were most effective stuck long after the episode ended, with little pieces of episodes still staying prevalent to this day nearly fifteen years later. And luckily, aside from a few glaring exceptions in fashion style (and a slightly different level of technology), the show is not dated either in seeing the same episodes again. For older audiences they aren't always spooky, which may make them all the better to hold onto for the next generation to scare the hell out of them.

At the least, it's worth seeing just for the opening titles; the first two shots look like they're out of a true horror movie, or a scary anti-drug ad."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Classic kids' horror show still holds up surprisingly well,"This was can't miss TV for me as a child. I would look forward to watching this show on SNICK every week. I remember being genuinely scared at times, and my parents would even watch with me and apparently also garnered some enjoyment out of the episodes. Sure it had it's campy and cheesy moments(what early 90's shows didn't?), but some of the performances by the young actors in this series were pretty decent. Many stories were based on common horror lore and myth, but some of the others were pretty original and clever as well.

Recently I have started watching this show again on Amazon Prime instant video. I expected it to be horribly campy and unwatchable now as an adult, the warm nostalgic memories being the only reason I'd watch a few episodes and be done with it... but to my surprise I was still entertained, and dare I say it... slightly spooked. Unlike the TV version of Goosebumps (completely unwatchable as an adult))this still holds up pretty well to this day. I wouldn't recommend this to any adult who doesn't already have the fond memories of the original run, as it would make for a pretty rough watch. I would however, recommend anyone with children looking to have some light, spooky, family fun to give this show a shot."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Want to see it again!,"This was my favorite childhood serial! I'd watch every episode of it, even though i was scared to hell. Those morbid yet meaningfull situations attracted me with an amazing power, it was simply deeper than the other pink glittery children show i could watch and surprisingly, i loved that. I just feel that the shows like this one and the first books i read as a kid, pretty much shaped the person i am today, and i am very thankful for that because i think i came out good.

Anyway, i'll never forget the episode with the clown, it appears it was called ""The Tale of the Crimson Clown"", because it was my worst nightmare for years, lol. I'm dying to watch this show all over again and see how i'll respond to it and compare with my past reactions!"
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Great show...,"In the late 1990's, when I was in my late 30's, I was a news junk. If the news was bad for the day, I would surf the channels. This Are You Afraid of the Dark show was awesome. Soon I was watching it everyday at around 5pm. What I liked most about the show was that each episode was unique and it kept you interested through the whole show. There was no real sex or violence, instead there was a really good story line and good acting-something that seems rare today. It was the type of show that you could watch with your kids and not feel ashamed. I really liked the way the story always seemed to wrap up on time at the end of the show and you felt good. Lots of famous and not so famous actors as well made it interesting time after time."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,"Before ""Goosebumps""...","...There was ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" - a kid-friendly horror show revolving around a group of teenagers, called the Midnight Society, who sit around a campfire in the woods and tell ghost stories, and then we segued directly into each bone-chilling kid-friendly horror tale.

What prompted this sudden review and stroll down memory lane is that one of Nickelodeon's adjunct cable networks is airing reruns of this great kid-friendly horror show that was most popular during the original Nickelodeon's hey-day back in the early 1990s. I was about 9 or 10 in '93 and '94, respectively, when ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" was at its peak. I remember that on Saturday nights, it was the fourth and final show (the other three were ""Doug,"" ""Rugrats,"" and ""The Ren & Stimpy Show"" - in that order) on Nick's ""Snick"" two-hour block. Boy, those were the good ol' days.

Like those other great shows, Nickelodeon quickly descended into idiocy (and continues doing so as I write this, although some credibility has been restored with ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"") when it began taking many of its greatest shows off the air for reasons unknown and replacing them with the likes of ""Spongebob Squarepants"" and other idiotic, mindless crap.

""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" was one of Nickelodeon's earliest and best shows. It was actually scary, but fun, and horror made just for kids. The ghost stories themselves were mostly typical good-vs.-evil-type stuff. Some episodes pushed the limits of its ""kid-friendly horror"" label (which, ironically enough, may have led to the show's early demise). A lot of famous teen actors (and film veterans) from the time made guest appearances in a number of different episodes, including Tatyana Ali (from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air""), Danny Cooksey (from another great Nick show canceled way before its time, ""Salute Your Shorts""), Melissa Joan Hart (from ""Clarissa Explains it All""), Tia and Tamera Mowry (from ""Sister, Sister""), Danny Tamborelli (""The Adventures of Pete & Pete""), and veteran film actor Charles S. Dutton.

Of course, problems began to arise with ""Are You Afraid of the Dark"" due to several unfriendly cast shake-ups both early on and later in the series, and Nickelodeon tried unsuccessfully to revive the show in 1999. Also, the episodes' content seemed to get watered-down later on in the series, thus loosing that teenage horror ""edge"" that made it great during its early run. Another factor was that author R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" titles may have also had a hand in ""Are You Afraid of the Dark's?"" demise in the mid-'90s. But thankfully, nostalgia, and possibly incessant fan demand, or the upcoming Halloween season, have allowed this great kid-friendly horror show to see the light of cable network television just one more time.

So, now you know one of Nickelodeon's best shows from its hey-day, and one of my personal favorite shows from its hey-day. Halloween is just around the corner, and so now it's great to go back to a time when this once-great cable network had an ounce of decency and honor and common sense left in its tank.

Are You Afraid of the Dark?,One helleva show to remember,"the best and last horror show of early 90's

during the 90's a lot of things were either horrible or stupid. I'm talking about TV shows. Are you afraid of the dark? is the only show where every saturday night kids get scared. The show was fun until the people of nickelodeon decided to take it off the air and now nickelodeon is one of the stupidest networks ever. The best thing about the show whenever Dr. Vink or Mr. Sardo came along. The best episodes were the tale of laughing in the dark; the tale of dark music; the tale of the prom queen; the tale of the quiet libriain; the tale of the midnight madness; the tale of cutter's treasure; the tale of the pinball machine; the tale of the nightly neighbors and the tale of the whispering walls.

""Vink's the name. Dr. Vink"" ""Dr. Fink?"" ""Vink! With a V-V-V!"""
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Campfire Tales,"There is always something exciting and fun about telling horror stories around a campfire. Whether it's the good company, the fire, or simply the fact that you are outside in the dark, surrounded by the woods which is pretty unsettling, each of the stories we hear are always unsettling because they fueled our imaginations and feed off of our fear and fascination with the unknown.

This show is my third favorite anthology horror and it's one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I really put this show high in my book because this is another childhood gem of mine, I've seen this show when I was about 10 years old. At the time I wasn't really into scary stories let alone wasn't even a fan of the horror genre. Nor was I even familiar with anthology horror. But this show was a pleasant surprise, it was scary at least from a kid's prospective but it was also fascinating and fun because with each story and episode it was always something different, you just never knew what to expect which I loved because finding that good or great episode/story that sticks with you was like finding buried treasure.

I really love the format of the show, from how it starts out where it's a campfire with an ensemble cast of kids and each of them had a story to tell and threw magic dust on the fire to start us off. This sequence in a way got the whole stories in the campfire trend going again as some of my friends late at night would go out on the weekend and listen or tell horror stories by the fire. But the ensemble of kids were solid, despite all horror hosts by their nature, each of the kids actually had a distinctive persona's which kinda make them all stick out but also shows they have different styles to their story telling.

I even really like that opening and the end theme song which is one of my favorite theme songs of all time. That opening is still one of the creepiest and scariest openings I've ever seen, it's just as creepy as the opening for the TV show ""Tales from the Darkside"" You just see a lot of random items all in the darkness along with some eerie tune which just adds to your chills because in each image your completely in the dark (no pun intended) from a swing that is still slightly swings is it a gust of wind or is there a ghost. Down to a key hole with some light coming out and possibly hearing footsteps, is there a sinister presence coming near.

It's true the only bad thing about the show is some effects aren't that good, but hey the show was done on a modest budget and it's a prime time kids show so they had to work with it. However what really gives this show fire is in the stories themselves and most of them are great and memorable. And most of these stories had minimum effects and also there is no gore not just because this was a kids show but because it didn't need it because it was using atmosphere, mood, and content to deliver the scares, and that's fine by me it is once again an example showing that horror doesn't have to rely on gore to be good and scary.

To me this show was sort of modern day Brothers Grimm and Folklore, most of those stories despite being in the realm of fantasy all also contained elements of horror, but also for a few morality. Four of my favorites are ""The Pinball Wizard"" that one was a fun one, it was pretty much similar to ""The Biship of Battle"" tale from the 80's film ""Nightmares"" just like in that tale, the protagonists had a gaming addiction and unfortunately has to play for keeps as the game comes to life. It was just awesome how the mall was used as a battle ground like in the film ""Dawn of the Dead"".

Another of course is ""The Prom Queen"" which is a modern take on an urban legend, in a way it could of been an episode of ""Koljak the Night Stalker"" as this story had investigative intrigue.

Third is ""The Dark Dragon"" which is kinda a dark version of Cinderella, this almost looked like the kind of tale Croninberg could've directed as we see some bodily horror, the make up effects are really on par.

And my favorite ""Tale of the Dream Girl"" which is emotional and like the film ""Angel Heart"" will have a twist you won't see coming.

I even like the fact that some of the story's had a reoccurring character or two from the creepy but blackly funny Dr. Fink but my favorite one is Sardo whom is kinda an colorful, eccentric and gay magician (or he just seemed that way). It was an interesting ploy for me and is something most anthology rarely do (except for the film ""Trick or Treat"") by interconnect characters and just showing how most of the tales are taking place in the same universe.

So for kids that want to get into horror this is a good place to start, and for the adult for the kid inside it's a great nostalgic ride. Just like an eternal flame, this show's fire still burns bright.

Rating: 4 stars"
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,One Of The Greatest Show Ever On TV For Kids,"Hello everyone who grew up in the 90s by far one of the greatest decades ever. During the 90s there were a lot of great shows on TV. Well one of the best shows that were on during the 90s was Are You Afraid of the Dark, which ran from 1991-1995. It was a show about a group of kids that called themselves the Midnight Sociaty, they would sit around the camp fire telling scary stories. The show was part of my childhood & I will always remember it, I wish it was still on in reruns. I was just at this Horror Convention in Orlando, FL where I found this show on DVD. It is a pretty hard show to find on DVD I think you can also get it online but I am not sure. When I started watching it, I remembered it right off the bat. I was bring memories from my childhood it was the first time I have seen its since it got canceled in 1995. The show was brought back again in 1999 & ran for two more seasons, but it wasn't as good as the first run. Well for all you guys who grew up in the 1990s hope you never forget about this really great show."

Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Yes,"When I was a kid, there was a ""Bala Dili"" program on ANS TV and they were giving episodes from this series. Even if we watched it with Azerbaijani dubbing, we were very afraid then."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,One for the opening and theme sound effects and two for acting,"I really don't know why everybody likes this show; I used to watch it when I was a kid and till know, I'm interested in nothing except for the theme song and good acting. There isn't a single episode I watched from this show and liked. Some episodes and I tell you SOME, when they start they seem to be good, but after some minutes their boring. I'm not saying that I liked any episode from this show, but eariler seasons and if they were bad, their not compared to how bad the later seasons appeared to be. The other thing I liked about this show is the acting; even though the acting in the earlier episodes wasn't that good, but it developed nicely by the time. Otherwise, almost all of the story lines were boring and if they weren't, the writing for the episodes itself is boring. But even though, I have to admit that this show not matter how bad it is, it's still not worser then 'Goosebumps'."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Part of my Childhood,"This show was a must see for Snick on Saturday nights when I was growing up. Some episodes actually scared me. I loved it and still would like to see it. Better than some of the crap they have on tv for kids now. Everybody remembers this show and loves it. Silly and campy as it was, it was good."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,"""I call this story..."" One hell of a kid's show, still awesome!","I still love this series dearly, it's such a retro 90's dream to me. Like most fans I first ever saw it when I was a kid at school, and being a big fan of horror movies and stories and stuff like that I was immediately hooked and it made a big impression on me and really captured my young imagination. It was so cool and fun seeing a group of kids around a campfire in the dark sharing scary stories. My favourite group was from the first season, there's something especially special about those earliest episodes to me. There isn't any throughout the series that quite manage to shake that 'safe' feeling that children's programming provides, but there's certainly a brilliant variety to them. There's occasionally some real imagination behind the goofy veneer, and some of the directors were able to be very creative with what they were given and managed to make their episodes stand out. They go from genuinely creepy tales like ""Dark Music"", ""Laughing in the Dark"" and ""The Dollmaker"", to more poignant and moving yarns like ""Apartment 214"" ""Shiny Red Bicycle"" and ""Dream Girl"". There were also the odd seriously whacked-out episodes like ""The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner."" But man, when they were bad they weren't kidding, and there's a fair amount of lame episodes where the cheesiness positively oozes from every frame and the acting is so gloriously bad that it's liable to leave you feeling a bit light-headed! We were all children when we loved it the most, but there's still loads of fun to be had from the show to this day. Maybe to some not in the most flattering light, but I think it holds up just the same, it's the greatest children's anthology show there ever was. I try to take it as seriously as possible even if the episode sure isn't making it easy. I don't enjoy it purely as a goof, like I'm not only deriving enjoyment by laughing at it, I don't believe I'd be a true fan if that were the case. I feel a tremendous loyalty towards this show, watching the eerie intro sequence and hearing the theme tune always gives me a warm nostalgic feeling inside that makes me smile. It will always be classic and great to me. From the bottom of my heart I thank every one of the different directors, producers and all of the creative minds that gave life to Are You Afraid of the Dark, you people gave many a childhood an extra touch of spooky magic!"
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,Nostalgic,"This show was a huge part of my childhood; each episode is so nostalgic! I'd love to say ""I wish they would bring it back"", but it wouldn't be the same. The simplicity of the '90's is something I miss and this show brings back that feeling. Thankfully I have the series on DVD! Now my daughter can enjoy these episodes with me."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,The Good Old Days!,"I loved this show, every night after school i used to watch it with my little brother, it scared the life out of me but it was brilliant! My favourite episode was the one where they had to cut down this tree, as everyone who entered became part of a game, which was to kill the others. it was really scary and put me off going into any woods! I cant remember what the episode was called as i was only small, but i remember the boy in the tree was ""Larry Tudgeman"" in Lizzie McGuire and i was soo chuffed when i saw him in it, it brought flooding back all those memories! I loved the candle at the beginning where it is blown out and all of the writing goes blue. Oh and at the end of each story, they threw the bucket of water over the fire to put it out! I haven't seen if for at least 10 years. Oh how i wish Nickeldeon would bring it back!"
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,AYAOTD Is A Pure Pop Horror Confection: An Excellent Television Show,"During the 90's, the cable television station Nickelodeon hosted a 2-hour Saturday evening program block of half-hour shows known as ""Snick"" (Saturday Night Nickelodeon). Airing from 8 PM to 10 PM, Snick featured shows geared to a (slightly) older audience in the preteen demographic by airing programs featuring more mature themes then the daytime programs. From season to season most shows risked being moved/canceled in their 8 to 9:30 slots, but the 9:30 slot stayed the same for a record of 5 seasons (from 1991 to 1996). That show was known as ""Are You Afraid Of The Dark?"" AYAOTD was a program featuring a cast of preteens who called themselves ""The Midnight Society"", a group of friends who gathered weekly in a forest campfire setting to tell spooky tales of ghosts, goblins, and anything within the supernatural and paranormal realms. A simple introduction into each weekly story began as ""submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I call this story..."" following a title for the episode (""The Tale of the Dead Man's Float"", ""The Tale of Apartment 214"", etc). Seasons to season, members of the society were changed, replaced, but the stories never got stale.

What made AYAOTD revolutionary for its generation was within its story structure: the show avoided criticism that normal sitcoms and shows face because it avoided cliché formatting. The show never lost its spirit because each week featured new characters and scenarios, keeping the show fresh and appealing. It was an ""X-Files"" or, even closer, ""Tales from the Crypt"", for a younger audience.

But the show can still be appreciated at an older age: AYAOTD did truly deliver for its genre. To assume the show couldn't deliver scares because it targeted such a young age group is false because the show certainly did. Its demographic allowed more focus on creating natural suspense and fear rather than artificially supplying it in the forms of over-excessive gore, violence, and language. Because the show avoided those clichés, it used strong mood lighting, clever camera-work and omniscient music in order to heighten the tension and fear. AYAOTD's writers were sharp enough to create scary tales that tapped into primal fears and childhood nightmares. The stories covered every type of unnatural force possible but somehow spun them into its own creative style. In its first season alone, AYAOTD covered topics such as clowns, ghosts, possession, vampires, creatures lurking in basements, and things hiding in the dark. It also knew its strengths and weaknesses: it was good at making the things that needed to scary scary, but strong dialogue was an apparent flaw. The acting was at best B-material, but in itself it shows the appeal of AYAOTD: the show was a light horror pop confection that took itself just serious enough to make your pulse race and your breath to shorten.

10 out of 10 is a grade that shouldn't be given out like candy, and I abide by that opinion. In essence, AYAOTD deserves a 10/10 because it accomplishes the primary requirement: to entertain. AYAOTD accomplishes this effortlessly, even in its later seasons, because it applied a format that allowed for fresh new ideas every week, never tiring the storyline or the viewer. AYAOTD told its last tale in 1996 when it was sadly canceled. But its popularity and fan-base was so strong that the show was remade with an all-new cast in the 99-00 season. Sadly, while it sounded like a good idea to bring back such a favored show, it just wasn't the same without the original Midnight Society and was quickly canceled after its first season. AYAOTD is not a television show to scares your pants off if you're above the age of 10, but even if you are older, you can't help but feel your spine tingle at the thought of what may be lurking within each episode. And if that isn't entertainment, I don't know what is."

Are You Afraid of the Dark?,An Honest Review,"This is getting a lot of love and I really don't know why. Most of it has to be nostalgia. Or maybe it could be a cultural thing, like maybe it's the people on the coasts that really liked this show. Or maybe it could just be like a city thing, I've been living in the city for about 15 years now and people praise it.

Anyway, when I was a a kid, it came out when I was about 10, and it was kind of summarized as a scary show for kids that isn't really scary.

It's like the kids that showed up to school with a Goosebumps novel, and were so brutally mocked that learned never to do it again, and came back with Stephen King like everyone else.

Are You Afraid of the Dark? kind of had that feel. The kinds that went to Kindercare and weren't latch-key watched it and were terrified by it. Everyone else just thought it was lame and watched Tales From the Crypt instead.

Occasionally it was watched, mostly it was sampled and then ignored. But, yeah, when it first came out I remember giving it an actual chance."
Are You Afraid of the Dark?,The Coolest Show for Kids,"When I was a kid, I loved this show. It scared me all the time, and I probably lost a lot of sleep because of it, but it was worth it to see all of these stories told by regular kids. It sparked my love for horror. The absolute scariest episode for me was ""The Night Shift"" where vampires invade a hospital. I can still remember parts, and they still scare me. One of these days I'm going to start my own Midnight Society...in broad daylight...with soap operas...and cheese fondue. Pretty scary, huh?"

Saverio Raimondo: Il Satiro Parlante,,
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,"I liked the first, but this was better","The first show set the Gundam universe up. It showed some complex things, but it was mostly about trying to escape from overwhelming enemies when your only hope is a ship and a giant robot manned by war displaced civilians. Now the second part just continues the story, but also brings more complexity and starts to expand the world with various factions, family drama, multiple ship and mobile suit designs, hidden bases and political intrigue. It also starts to show that no matter on which side you are you get good and bad people and that you can respect your enemy while you are killing them as you have to fight next to people you despise.

I thought the first Gundam was a little bit more technical, here they just throw new designs around and think less of how people manage on the inside of these fighting machines, but they also expand the characters and the political map and get more into the antiwar message that I feel the series is pushing. In conclusion I liked it more than its predecessor.

Comparing the movies might be irrelevant anyway, since both were released in the same year, so in fact it's just the second part of a larger story, with more to come. I will be watching Gundam III now."
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,Gundam continues being a solid 'show'.,"I'm definitely invested in this universe now. It weirdly feels nostalgic watching this, as if Transformers/Scooby-Doo/Dragon Ball primed me for a linear, serious story with the same quirks of the era.

The pacing is a little odd, but it's TV episodes meshed together so I'll let it slide once again. I'm enjoying where the characters seem to be going. There's some interesting developments that add depth and mystery to their motivations, and side characters like Kai really blossom here.

I can't believe there's only one more film left to cover the original story. Fortunately I'll be watching two shows afterwards and Char's Counterattack. Beyond that, who's to say? Lots of room for stories in space."
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,A movie for the tv series fan.,"Judging as a movie, it seems fast paced with lots of small plots, conflicts and the fighting after some time kind of gets repetitive. I have heard the tv series is much better and have given required focus on portraying emotions. This being a compilation of the same, although lot of rework done, as a standalone might not please all audience."
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,A classic continues....,"Condensed from the middle section of the television series, Gundam Movie II has 30% reanimated scenes, so, despite some dated animation, there is some nice eye candy if you look for it. Unlike the previous installment, this Gundam movie takes place entirely on Earth, as Amuro and the White Base crew deal with Zeon ace Ranba Ral,A trio of ace pilots known as Black Trinary, spies and their old enemy Char Anzable. Char remains largely absent for most of this volume, as the focus shifts to the main protagonists, Amuro Ray and Sayla Mass. This movie's a little slower compared to the other two, but you'll probably enjoy it nonetheless."
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,"Like the first film, feels more like a binge of several episodes of a TV series than a movie, but a decent binge.","The war between the Principality of Zeon and the Earth Federation continues as the crew of the White Base and Gundam pilot Amuro Ray fight Zeon's Earth Occupation Force as Amuro struggles with the realization that he's a offshoot of humanity called a ""Newtype"" and what that entails for him in the ever blurring lines of the conflict.

The second film in the compilation film trilogy of Mobile Suit Gundam's first series, Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow continues the story of Amuro Ray as the pilot of the Gundam with White Base engaged in an earthbound conflct with Zeon's forces. Like the previous series entry, Soldiers of Sorrow is primarily made from episodes of the show and like the previous film it hits all the expected beats but doesn't really form a cohesive whole.

For me a lot of Soldiers of Sorrow felt like a ""bridge"" entry in the trilogy in that it exists simply as set-up for the payoffs in the third film. While sometimes ""bridges"" are necessary in storytelling, Soldiers of Sorrow is a case where it makes it maybe a tad more obvious that it's a bridge point than it should. There's a part of the movie where Amuro Ray is at odds with White Base commander Bright Noa due to Amuro's suspected status as a ""Newtype"" leading to Amuro being sidelined temporary for reasons that don't really resonate all that well since we're really not told what a ""Newtype"" is until quite a ways into the movie. There are some solid story beats in the film such as subplot between an self-interested dismissive pilot named Kai who falls for Miharu, a reluctant Zeon spy who has no love for Zeon but does what she does to support her younger brother and sister after the loss of their parents and it falls nicely under the series/film's explorations of war in how it effects regular people who are just trying to survive and have no interest in the political machinations of the conflict. But aside from that, most of this really just feels like set-up for the confrontations in the final film.

Soldiers of Sorrow is okay. It boast the same engaging action as the first film, but there's not as much emotional resonance with the characters this time around. It's worth a viewing simply for the sake of completing the trilogy and seeing the story as told in film format, but it's a little messy in the execution."
Mobile Suit Gundam II: Soldiers of Sorrow,An average effort with some interesting concepts,"Mainly concerning one character, but for the rest the original series is still better than this. Extremely choppy editing, a lot of plot contrivances left dangling and the ideas at the core of the 0079 series (in particular the author's disapproval of military authority vs. the civilian efficency) thrown away in favour of pure action don't make this a must-go by any mean. We're still in the territory of non-necessary here."

Servant of the People,Life imitating art,"Having seen just the first episode, this is endearing and very funny. Zelensky is an engaging, human and funny man. A schoolteacher becomes president. And now, in turn the comedian becomes president, for real... and one of the bravest leaders in modern times. The strangeness of seeing him on screen in this role and comparing that to the heart wrenching statements shown on every newschannel in the free world is unimaginable but for the fact that it is horribly real. The world is facing such peril, the like of which has not been seen since 1945, yet this TV comedy, in a language unfathomable to most western ears brings humanity and hope, through a man destined to go down in history as both comedian and hero."
Servant of the People,Brilliant campaigning disguised as TV show,"Such a light-hearted comedy. I am a big fan of Parks and Rec (another top-rated political comedy) but Servant of the People has replaced it as my favorite in the genre. The show must have been pivotal in getting the main actor elected as president of Ukraine IRL in 2019.

The show gives great insight into Ukraine's pains and worries about the rampant corruption. I was born and raised in Ukraine and watching the show from the U.S. brings nostalgia and inspires hope that one day I can return into a truly free country."
Servant of the People,Reality imitates Art,"I was impressed after binge-watching Season 1. It paints a picture of Ukraine, so I can now relate to a culture I knew nothing about. Furthermore, given Zelensky's rise to the Presidency and the current events on top, it is worth watching just for that.

The series is well made with very modest resorces and it is fresh. The actors, for example, who are not well known and look pretty common, do a good job. The plot line is consistent and sometimes very original. The jokes are funny. So go ahead, get entertained and informed at the same time."
Servant of the People,When life is stranger than movies,"This actor is genius, he made us to think a movie is the reality and the reality is just a movie. Moreover, he made us believe in heroes, more than The Avengers, and in sacrifice, more than 300. You should see it because, sometimes, a great leader can be dressed as a clown and a clown can be dressed as a leader. Stop Putin today!"
Servant of the People,"Charming, Brilliant, and More","Pres. Zelenskyy's series (back on Netflix) is wonderful, and his history teacher who becomes President steps off the screen and into our hearts believably. He is just as charming with that beautiful voice and just as clearly the man his people elected and the heroic leader most of us have come to love. Strongly recommended: these are roughly half-hour episodes linked by bits and codas moving smoothly into the President becoming what he was born to be: And in real life, the time he was born for and the man we needed so much. Truly historical and also heartbreaking. Because now he must put his life on the line and save his country. The images of beautiful Ukraine now being destroyed are beyond painful, and valiant people we see everywhere in the film are now resistance fighters for democracy. Yes it has flaws in timing and predictability here and there, but I gave it the 10 not only because it is a fine series, but also because life imitated art and gave us this hero. This is an extraordinary accomplishment and moment in history. ""Slava Ukraini!"""
Servant of the People,An unexpected gem,"Whoever ridiculed or doubted comedian Zelensky's ability to properly do the job of a president who's not fictional, might have had changed their mind after the recent events. And yes, it's a pretty accurate description of someone in the midst of a corrupt political system entangled with personal interests. Zelensky is genuinely funny and he's proven himself beyond the tv show too, from music to dancing. I'll never forget the video where he might as well pull off ""All the single ladies"", in leather and stillettos. Definitely have a look. And with the remarkable qualities he displayed recently, I bet Netflix will be streaming The Servant again. Don't be surprised if you see a film trailer with him either, I just wonder who'll play the leading man."
Servant of the People,Almost funny fairytale,"The first season - it is an interesting new format with funny jokes about a vital issue at that time. The second season - it is a feeling that the jokes are sucked from the finger, and the series is simply trying to sarcastic over politics. Bad trying, but somehow it will go. The third season - you need to somehow finish it. ... After the first season, this whole sarcastic theater, in my opinion, more and more slipped into some kind of absurdity. Humor for the sake of humor, but not the plot."
Servant of the People,"Almost every review is positive, yet it is 7.3. Wonder why. (NOT)","Watching it in 2022, I cannot sit back, relax and enjoy this surprisingly witty and funny series. It is like one of those movies that you have watched a 100 times and yet when you watch them for the 101th time, you hope and pray that the hero survives. Well, Zelensky became president and made his life hell. Nothing to do about that now. Let's hope and pray that he and his country survive."
Servant of the People,"Good, and the ratings are hilarious with the amounts of 0s and 10s","Good and fun. Nothing life changing obviously but it's a generally light comedy. Baddies seem to be pretty simple, perhaps too cartoonish and one dimensional. Seem like villains from a cartoon show. Obviously this isn't a cartoon and is a comedy show and isn't meant to be taken that seriously, but any form of art, particularly those with real people(not cartoon characters) can partially affect life as has been show with Zelensky's election. Also the sheer amount of 1 and 10 ratings are brilliant, no political motivation regarding the Russia conflict whatsoever there! Dont know what else i can say. The 10s can be deemed reactionary, sure, but the 1s are reactionary too, it's just that they're edgy contrarians on top of it."
Servant of the People,The series is bad,"The series is bad and dull, some of the scenes are stretched to the floor of the series. The series puts a lot of pressure on the problems of Ukrainian

power, thanks to which, Zelensky is now a president, people chose not Zelensky but Goloborodko !!!"
Servant of the People,Zelenskyy: a president who can act,"What a charming, witty series!

It's heartbreaking that this beautiful place and these lovely people are currently facing destruction by fascist-imperialist Putin and his brainwashed horde."
Servant of the People,"As an American, it's a good watch","I decided to watch the show shortly after Netflix put it on in the US. The first season was mediocre, but the second season was really good! The third season is very different pacing, but I still like it. It's great that even with little knowledge of Ukrainian culture, I was able to understand who the different characters really were."
Servant of the People,Pretty good even without the historical context,"Watching the series while the war is raging in Ukraine and its lead is playing a larger than life role in tectonic real-world events is surreal. But the series is pretty good in its own right.

By now, everyone knows the premise: an honest high-school history teacher Vasyl Holoborodko becomes a president through a series of improbable events (at least, back then it would be deemed improbable...). He tries to get things done in a ridiculously corrupt system, despite the odds.

There are several aspects that set Servant of the People apart from numerous ""outsider fixes the system"" movies though. The makers are brave enough to avoid the usual ""simple folks are saints"" or ""power corrupts"" tropes. Many of these simple folk, when given a chance, steal as much (or more) than their predecessors. At one point, Holoborodko makes an impassionate speech about how the innocent and well-meaning children step by step turn into corrupt and indifferent ""khokhols"" littering and corrupting and sending their own children abroad because everything is already littered and corrupted.

(Speaking of which: the Netflix translation is, put it this way, sanitised. There are homophobic and nationalistic slurs used, even though in a context that is not necessarily homophobic or nationalistic.)

Holoborodko himself does not always win, and makes silly gaffes, sometimes with disastrous consequences. His decisions are not always wise, like assigning his less than bright childhood friend to become a foreign minister.

The rest of the presidential team is played by other members of Kvartal 95, the Monty Python-esque Ukrainian comedy troupe that was headed by Zelenskyy before his ascent to politics in real life. They are okayish but aren't that interesting except Yevhen Koshovy cast as a bumbling foreign minister.

Among the supporting cast, Stanislav Boklan as Yuriy Chuyko is a standout. He is very much a Ukrainian version of Sir Humphrey Appleby from Yes Minister / Yes Prime Minister, an experienced, cynical, and corrupt veteran of Ukrainian politics playing by corrupt rules.

The nameless three oligarchs are the weakest part. It's like Kvartal 95 spent 3 seconds thinking them through. They either eat super-high-fibre food, drink champagne, or play Monopoly. When they talk to their fixers and henchmen, it's always either while eating or playing Monopoly. It's like the super-rich are stuck in a weird Groundhog Day.

Interestingly enough, Russia is looming in the background but does not prominently feature in the series, even though it was already after Crimea and Donbas. (Apart from the famous ""Putin Hublot"" joke, the part when he yells ""Putin got overthrown!"" to gain attention, and the hilarious conversation with Ivan the Terrible.) The main beef of Holoborodko is with the corruption and the mentality perpetuating it, not with anyone else.

Common comedic tropes are there but executed well. There's a pretty good ""Hangover""-inspired chapter, the mismatched couples like the minister of foreign affairs and his aide, and Holoborodko's own dysfunctional family.

The lack of knowledge about overseas kinda weirded me out (folks, masala chai is delicious, Indians comfortably deal with foreigners in their foreign terms, and not everyone is transgender in the Netherlands!), but these are very minor bits.

The underlying message is that the change is hard but not impossible. That there are, after all, principled and honest people who know what they're doing and try to get things done. And if Ukraine and Zelenskyy manage to pull through the hellish ordeal Ukraine is going through now, Sluga narodu will be one of the greatest stories ever told.

Slava Ukraini!"
Servant of the People,Excellent Political Satire,"If I were to have watched this before the Ukraine/Russia war, I would have thought this was very clever and well-acted. But viewing it within the context of the day, my opinion changes only slightly. That slight change comes in the form of admiration for Zelensky, who is clearly a skilled actor. If you enjoy such shows as MASH or Veep, or are interested in seeing Ukraine's president in his former job, then I highly recommend checking this out."
Servant of the People,The funniest thing about this series....,"The funniest thing about this series is that the actor who's portraying the President of Ukraine has indeed became the President of Ukraine on the elections held on 31 March 2019 :)

The series itself is a lot of fun, you most likely will enjoy it a lot :)"
Servant of the People,Not sure how this is working out for the Urakanians,Yes as stated the weirdest thing is the guy actually did become president of the Ukaraine. Not knowing the day to day on the ground their dont know if he is good or not. Im guessing they saw Trump win in the US and said the same thing. Tired of politicians give someone else the role. I guess when their are huge protests then he will be gone but I think he is doing the best he can in a country at war with Russia beset on all sides and corrupt as all get out. As for the show it had its moments enjoy subtitles Im leaning toward a 6 half way into season one will see from their Funny only 3 seasons as he got elected president for real. Again cant make this stuff up
Servant of the People,Not only he can act,"He is also a decent president. To be honest, i was doubtful of this tv show before is started watching it. Over the course of my 3 days off i finished it. It was great, inspiring, and funny."
Servant of the People,Low level political absurd comedy,"Yes, the crew tryed really hard to build plot on Monthy Python concept. But they just scratched the surface of real absurd comedy.

Scenography is pretty good. Zelenskiys acting is childish funny, with unusual deep, nice, and sharp voice.

Best from series is fact of political tv Show prequel of real power takeover.

Side characters are poor acted, uniformly.

Worst is- there is nothing to make man laughing, either from fun, up to wannabe great sitcom sketches or sarcasm. Furthermore, in actual war with all his media weapons, this ""comedy"" is more and more just cheap popcorn daily dose of ""support current thing"" in order of political correctivity.

Conclusion: Good try, poor artistic execution of roles ( Except Zelenskiys own talent for absurd acting), and worth only as show for younger Zelenskiys fan Army."
Servant of the People,Fantastic,"Not often do I come across something which without being vulgar or merely trying to shock you with indecency, manages to portray the (perceived?) reality of politics in such a raw fashion. The last time I was stuck to my screen with such interest was when watching Dr. Strangelove. I'm not proud to say that (even?) as a Western European, the political incompetence and blatant corruption are very familiar, so the plot works no matter where you live.

The casting is great, the satire is splendid, the plot is amusing. I'm sold."
Servant of the People,"Witty, clever, lighthearted","I don't usually watch Eastern European production, as it's usually bad. But recent events got me curious. And I quite liked it! Good dialogues, the charm of local ""culture"", funny characters and almost fairytale hero, who tries to fight bad guys. It was cute. I even forgave all that hysterical screaming, which is common in Eastern European comedies. Western world may find lots of stereotypes, sexism and such, but please understand that everything takes time in different cultures."
Servant of the People,An Underrated TV Show,"I expected a shallow comedy, but it was more than that. Storyline, humor, even characteristics, perfect. Also, the great acting of the cast should not be forgotten. I laughed, I sympathized, I even got angry for the protagonist. It is amazing every characters had their back grounds, and even the antagonist and the villain were awesome. The series never failed at surprising me, the plot twists were always great. It has such a well-written script. Also, it makes good point about political corruptions.

My favorite characters were Iouri Ivanovitch Tchuiko (Vasily's friend-enemy) and Mikhail Ashotovich Tasunyan (Vasily's friend)."
Servant of the People,TV-series which became reality,"A simple history teacher thanks to a viral video on the Internet becomes the president of the country. It would seem, how is this possible? The hero becomes the president of the country in reality.

This is a historyless case, but this is the current reality and we will have to live with it."
Servant of the People,"Given what's happening, how can this not be a 10?","This is genuinely a LOL satire. Found myself guffawing often despite having to catch humor from subtitles. Characters are memorable, distinctly sketched, and hilarious, except perhaps the ""bad guys"" who are rather generically villanous. However, I have to doff my critical hat here in view of the vicious war against the people of Ukraine and the rallying leadership of the actor-president now real-president. Magical realism at its most magical, and its most realist. May justice and peace prevail!"
Servant of the People,I love it,"One of the best shows in my opinion, mostly true and applicable for all Eastern European countries, for us balkans! We can relate so much with all that corruption, bad politicians and more... I am sorry though we only get to see in such bad times while poor Ukraine is at war. A satire full of Humor and truth. Also I can not, not mention how good of an actor Zelenski is! He is very talented truly! I really hope for peace and with peace coming to see more of zelenski'a art!"
Servant of the People,Zelenskyy is a SUPER STAR,"Sweet and brave political satire with outstanding performances and noticeable production value.

The final scene between the President and the tzar, Ivan the Terrible, is almost psychedelic in a sad way- the Ukrainian hero is trying to convince the Russian despot to leave Ukrainian people alone and ""let Ukraine to evolve its way"" . The Russian tzar starts strangling the Ukrainian President with his bare hands.( Reminiscence to famous picture of Repin) But Ukrainian president doesn't give up.

Beside, the president Zelenskyy has such a charm in this role, that I would vote for him the president of the World."
Holy Expectations,,
VeggieTales in the City,What white nonsense is this?!,"I hate VeggieTales in the City because it makes all of the characters look and sound too different. The casting department was too cheap to cast more than one replacement male and female actor for all the original characters not voiced by Mike or Phil! You can hear that problem in almost all of Tress MacNeille's female character voices, for example. Junior Asparagus, a young boy character, sounds too boyish, and not girly enough like the way Lisa's Junior originally sounded, Laura sounds uncomfortably high-pitched, and Madame Blueberry's new voice doesn't even try to have a French accent. The only female veggie whom Tress MacNeille can have sound close to her original voice is Petunia Rhubarb. Even with Phil and Mike voicing their own characters again, you can tell VeggieTales in the House has terrible voice direction, particularly in Archibald's voice. I liked having Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki reprise most of their characters in this series because that at least gave VeggieTales in the House some of the same identity that the original VeggieTales had, but it is very sad that, while they still get a credit for VeggieTales in the City being based on characters created by them, they don't write any VeggieTales in the City episodes of their own. However, Tim Hodge and Brian K. Roberts still got to direct some episodes, so they might be decent and resemble the spirit of the original film series more.

Like many VeggieTales fans who dislike in the House & City, and possibly Noah's Ark, we believe VeggieTales in the House/City takes place in an alternate universe from the veggies who acted out or experienced all of the stories in the original video series. From Where's God When I'm S-Scared up to Beauty and the Beet, as well as The VeggieTales Show, because all of the veggies have different designs and live in a little city below the countertop, which was only used to host Noah's Ark in this new world. Even if you can get past the bizarre new cheap animation style and different character voices, the writing is just not there. VeggieTales in the House & City has the bizarre energy of Fanboy & Chum Chum, which does not bode well with the original VeggieTales, and most of the time, Larry is an idiot and the stories are very uncreative and it is easy to guess what the lesson will be by the third minute of eleven. Furthermore, I feel very bad for Phil Vischer with VeggieTales in the House being more ""de-Goded"" than the qubo TV broadcasts of stories from VeggieTales videos in 23-minute episodes. Occasionally, a Bible verse will be read, but in an off-the-walls show like this that purged the religious aspects of VeggieTales, it doesn't feel the same to end every episode with the same ""God made you special and He loves you very much"" closing line from the original show.

Still, there are some things that I do enjoy and miss about VeggieTales in the City. It is much more watchable than the Japanese and Chinese spin-offs of Lilo & Stitch, The 2016 Powerpuff Girls, and My Little Pony: Pony Life, which are all bad spinoffs or reboots that butcher their Intellectual Property's predecessor very hard. I realized that there are some salvageable aspects of VeggieTales in the House since Callie Flower was good enough to come into the prime VeggieTales universe in The VeggieTales Show. Motato, Gary Garlic, Mr. & Tiny Pea, Shem, Granny Asparagus, Officer Wedge, and Ichabeezer are all other entertaining characters I may like to see redesigned one day in The VeggieTales Show. I still have a bit of respect for VeggieTales in the City for trying some new things. Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki definitely did not like Dreamworks and Netflix butchering their property with less intelligent writing, but maybe they enjoyed the new experience it gave them because, they had never voice acted in a half-hour Nickelodeon-type series. Phil Vischer pitched VeggieTales to Nickelodeon in 1991, but Nick was not interested in early computer animation one decade before Jimmy Neutron. I liked hearing their classic character voices in a slice-of-life setting, but in the House certainly could have used some better writing that felt more like VeggieTales even in their weird wacky city. VTitC is also worth watching because Phil and Mike also both voice a new recurring character, Phil Vischer is Granny Asparagus and Mike Nawrocki is Officer Wedge. I also liked having Rob Paulsen, who voiced Finnegan J. Beet from Beauty and the Beet, use the same voice for Ichabeezer in VeggieTales in the City because the same grouchy voice suited both characters. I was also surprised at how much I liked some of this show's new characters, like Motato, Tiny Pea and Callie Flower."
VeggieTales in the City,Weird show,"This is a weird show. A weird show bordering on creepy. The vegetables do not have visible hands. Or visible legs. Yet they move like they have legs. And the objects levitate around the characters as if they have hands. The stories are as well as aberrant as the vegetables.

But nice touch with the vegetable characters. It's a nice variation from killer robots.

VeggieTales in the City,Religious claptrap,"Being from the UK, I've never heard of VeggieTales before. I put VeggieTales In The City on Netflix for my 4 year old thinking it was just a funny cartoon. Turns out each episode is full of religious nonsense with one episode ending ""Remember, God loves you"". It was swiftly turned off."
VeggieTales in the City,Don't know why everyone's so negative on this show,"So many people seem to be expecting so much more out of it, and I think that's an expectation set by other children's shows that nowadays target an adult audience too - but if you look at this for what it is, a perfectly harmless show about silly vegetables doing silly things.

And yes, like the original Veggie Tales this show quotes Christian scripture and makes mention of God after each episode, but it isn't trying to preach to children, it's just using scripture to teach morals alongside a goofy cartoon show. It's actually *less* religious than the original show.

That being said, I wouldn't call it phenomenal or remarkable in any really distinct way - but it really isn't offensive of bad either, and I think it deserves a rating higher than it currently has."

Some Assembly Required,Kids Love Shows Adults Hate,"If this nightmare was intentionally made to be the worst thing on television, it would be an instant cult hit. Heck, maybe that is what's going on and the joke is ultimately on all of us offering a serious review.

It is indeed just as bad as everyone else has claimed. There aren't many things that actually make my skin shrink by three sizes when I watch it, but this does the trick every time.

That being said, like all other shows that make my hair grow in reverse, my kids can't get enough. I don't get it at all, but I don't need to because this show is not made for buzzkillers like me."
Some Assembly Required,Little above average,"I noticed something with people reviewing this show, they either hate it or love it, but i kinda say i'ts funny at times, but it's also annoying and obnoxious at a rare occasion. I say that you should give it a try, but it is not so bad, but also not incredible."
Some Assembly Required,One of the worst shows I've ever seen,"My daughter has been watching this on Netflix and I'm going to have to make her stop. If you want to watch a show with simply awful acting where the characters are shallow, rude, and stupid, this one is for you. I literally can't stand having it play in my home. We all lose brain functionality every time it's on. Can't believe it made it through 3 seasons!"
Some Assembly Required,Misfire,Comentario no disponible
Some Assembly Required,The actual worst!,"I simply hate my life when my children have this on the TV. I appreciate the thought, but the acting is awful, the timing is awful, and the way they portray the characters is horrible. The two characters who are supposed to be the ""good looking"" ones are portrayed as airheads. I just can't. But, there's no cussing or sexual themes, so I suppose I'll allow it."
Some Assembly Required,How is this allowed to happen?,"I can't even imagine how someone in authority gave this the green light. It is unimaginably bad. I'm not using hyperbole either. This literally has no redeeming factors. Absolutely none. I feel embarrassed for the 'actors', and I use scare quotes because nothing that these 'actors' do could be even closely defined as such. It's an insult to actors everywhere. Did they give them classes to get so bad? I mean, you see the occasional bad actor in kids shows, but this show's entire cast must be made up of high school drama club rejects. Yes, it really is that bad. Sometimes I will rate a show or movie 1 star because of how badly it failed to meet expectations, but this one gets 1 star because it genuinely deserves it. Don't ever let your kids watch it because you will love to regret it."
Some Assembly Required,Innocent and charming,"Okay, it's a bit cheesy, but quite charming and full of puns and innocent humor. I enjoy watching this with my 8 and 10 year old. 😁"
Some Assembly Required,It's funny! Don't listen to the others on here.,"Some of the reviewers on here are way too harsh for what this show is - it's a kids show. It's for KIDS. I personally find it hilarious at times, and much more watchable than some of the Disney or Nickelodeon shows I'm forced to watch.

It's got a fast pace and lots of jokes, and yes it's silly, but that's it's charm. And unlike some of the other jaded reviewers on here, I find the kids extremely talented. I hope they all continue to act.

For a kid's show it's a 10. For general audience a solid 7. Give it a try on Netflix if you have a kid who is around 7-8 and see what their reaction is. My daughter loves it and I enjoy watching it too."
Some Assembly Required,Ehhh,"Well, it does one or two things well. I enjoyed the character Piper, (Charlie Storwick) and one episode where they have a beauty pageant. (except for the preachy and forced ending.) Other than that, the show ranges from mediocre to terrible. The humor is forced, and the laugh track really doesn't help either. The characters (Save for Jarvis) are stereotypes. Geneva is the dumb blonde obsessed with her looks, Bowie is the nerd (yet he somehow manages to be almost as dumb as Geneva), Piper is the tech nerd\Goth Chick, Aster is the shortest of the bunch, and a fashion obsessed jerk, and Knox is the dumb jock. I understand that it's a kid's show, but kids aren't dumb. I think it needs to make actual characters and have them develop throughout the story instead of making cardboard cut outs."
Some Assembly Required,"To all those who gave this show a negative rating,","The problem with people's terrible summarizations are: well, they say it's terrible and then give no basis for it. As for a kid's sitcom, it's pretty good. Also, an opposition to a laugh track is ridiculous; it's not hurtful... Why are you complaining about it? After you watch and binge enough sitcoms to tune out the laugh track, it's basically not there. Now, to the people who say they are going to put their children up for adoption if they continue to watch the show, and this is a serious comment. Screw you, you are going to burn in hell."
Some Assembly Required,"A good, clean show.","No there are no lessons to learn, and yes the plot is razor thin, but with the rest of today's programming having adult concepts sprinkled into their shows it is refreshing to have a clean show that my kids can watch. There needs to be more programming like this out there."
Some Assembly Required,Something feels really wrong with the pace and timing.,"I really like the idea on which the TV Series is built. The cast is great as well as the production, but something feels wrong while you are watching. It's hard to explain but it seems to be ""home made"". I blame the pacing of the show, the editing, those fractions of time between the lines, the timing of the laughs, some void between dialogues... It just feels an unnatural flow, like forced. Like that play in grade six where kids are waiting for their cue to say their lines. My two kids, in middle and elementary school, say this is the show they like least of YTV (Canadian Network similar to Nickelodeon). We find that a lot of episodes have such a lousy story, not funny at all and with very basic plots with dull resolutions, sometimes we just don't laugh at all during the whole show, and what's the point of a comedy that is not funny. Yes, there are some episodes that we have enjoyed and had a good laugh, especially with Mrs Bubkes, but not enough to give the show a better rating."
Some Assembly Required,Can we inspire please?,"""Why should we be punished to do Math?"" Are you kidding me? These stereotypes really damage students' attitudes towards math. Maybe inspire for a change. Overall, this show is a bunch of obnoxious scenarios that contribute nothing unique or noteworthy to entertainment."

Some Assembly Required,Can't give it negative,The fact anyone would let their child watch this is disturbing.
Some Assembly Required,nasty and horrible things being taught.,"Awful show for kids, for example in the first episode, the girl with blonde was reading a magazine and she though when it said shorter it meant short skirts, and all the guys said ""its does"" and ""the shorter the better"" which is clearly disrespectful since the girl clearly didn't understand. This show is normalizing disrespect towards young and all girls in general, its teaching children that's saying stuff like that's okay."
Some Assembly Required,Best show ever!,Some Assembly Required is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen! Some people have been saying bad things about this show but I think they're wrong. It's one of the funniest and best comedy shows on Earth. I am 7 years old and my Dad loves it a lot too. He even laughs at it!
Some Assembly Required,Binged this as an adult.,"This show has some really bad reviews, which compelled me to make a review of my own. I like this show, loved it as a kid, and recently just kinda decided to watch it all again. I thought ""hey I'll just watch a few episodes as a little blast to the past!"". I watched it all. It's amusing, dumb, entertaining, surreal and cheesy. Like seriously, to all the grumpy grumps reviewing this, what more can you expect from a kids sitcom? I genuinely laughed from some of the jokes made in this show, It's so on the nose to the point that it's funny. Is it perfect? Of course not. The production value isn't fantastic, some themes are poorly executed and there aren't great plot lines. Is it still entertaining? Yup. Now I've seen some people call the acting bad, and I actually disagree with that. I think the actors are good, and this is because to me it is clear that they are doing what they've been asked to do by their director. Being goofy. The energy and emotion they put into the show is great and I'd bet they'd be great in other stuff if I ever saw them! I'm gonna be real with you, I'd be lying to you if I didn't say some of these scenes and lines haven't been stuck in my head ever since I saw them for the first time when I was like eight. As a kid I saw a lot of sitcoms on Disney Channel, nickelodeon and whatever, and the truth is that it's unique. It's so surreal I haven't seen anything really like it, and it's certainly much more original than a lot of other kids shows out there. So I just want to thank you Some Assembly Required, for entairtaning me as a child and giving me some good laughs as an adult."
Some Assembly Required,What??,Worst show I've ever seen in my life. If my son chooses to continue to watch this garbage I may have to put him up for adoption. Hopefully by tomorrow he will come to his senses. We are on the first episode. I'm 12 minutes in and I literally can not take it any longer. That laugh track is enough to send you over the edge. Is is necessary to play the laugh track after every other sentence??? This makes me want to cancel Netflix for the rest of my life. The fact that this show has multiple seasons Blows my mind.
Some Assembly Required,Ingenious,"Absurd, funny and well thought. I love it - and I am far away from the target age."
Some Assembly Required,Awful,This is one of the worst shows I have ever seen. Even for a kids show this show is incredibly stupid with some of the worst writing and acting I have ever witnessed on TV.
Some Assembly Required,Horrible,"The show was obviously written by a bunch of monkeys. The jokes are dirty and make no sense whatsoever. All the characters in the show are all stupid and are completely oblivious to their surroundings. The humor is dry and does not have high ratings. It's obvious the makers of this show were trying to rope in a quick buck. It's not a funny show and should not air. Take your chances and watch something better or perhaps instead of watching this maybe you should go have a root canal instead. It's better than watching this garbage. If I were to rate this show, I would probably give it a 1. What I mean by all the characters are stupid, THERE ALL STUPID! No clue in the world whatsoever on how to do things"
Some Assembly Required,Stupid,Why is this even on Netflix!!! It's sooooo dumb! 3/10 rating
Some Assembly Required,Awfully Awful,"Sorry I hate to be cruel but I couldn't help myself and this show really is scraping the bottom of the barrel so hard that the bottom of the barrel is wearing away. ""Some Assembly Required"" is truly a terrible TV watching experience and in my opinion it fails badly on every level.

The writing is absolutely atrocious with fake and hackneyed dialogue and jokes that literally make me cringe time and again. You can usually tell exactly what the joke is going to be and basically get buried under an avalanche of terrible punch lines and then an over the top, desperate laugh track.

The acting is also terrible. I know these are just children, or teens playing children and young adults playing teens, but they're just not very good. Every single cast member misses the mark. Of course this isn't entirely their fault... like I said the writing is terrible and the casting department really missed the mark here as well.

The effects are also complete rubbish. I mean, every single thing about this show is just cheap and bad. I can't believe this lasted more than one season, or that it even made it on the air at all. Spectacularly bad TV."

Snabba Cash,Awesome show BUT you have to watch it in original language,Awesome show BUT you have to watch it in original language! You cannot watch it with English dubbing. English version RUINS the show. Makes it so cheesy! The original is awesome trust me.
Snabba Cash,Raw and in your face,This show hits the ground running. It is fast paced and emotional. The actors did an excellent job of depicting the hustle and life's struggles. I was impressed. Much love from Texas.
Snabba Cash,Great Story,"It's a riveting if not a gloomy story. It vividly portrays the dire consequences of chasing easy money, particularly for 3 protagonists, namely, Leya (Evin Ahmed), Salim (Alexander Abdallah) and young Tim (Ali Alarik), who have different reasons to want to get rich quick.

Acting is great for the main protagonists as well as for those in supporting roles such as Dada Fungula Bozala (Ravy) and Olle Sarri (Tomas Storm). Plot development is on point. Script is well-written devoid of unnecessary scenes and execution couldn't be better.

What seems to be novel about the film is that the story is told from the point of view of Muslim migrants in their neighborhoods surprisingly in Sweden. This is the first time I watch a movie in this context."
Snabba Cash,Superior Swedish production,"I watched this directly after Braqueurs, another series featuring Muslim immigrants and organised crime but set in France. I have to say that Snabba Cash was superior. For a start, there was the sub plot of Leya's start up needing cash so the action was not so relentlessly set in crack dens and poor immigrant areas. There was less of the unbelievability of baddies getting killed by revolvers when they were using assault rifles. It seemed far more real.

The acting was on the ball and the settings were real. I particularly liked Alexander Abdallah as Salim whose brooding good looks infused the series.

There is scope for a second season after the events of the final episode. If it is ever made, I'll be watching it."
Snabba Cash,International standard,"The settings, realism and the charachters are not something were used to in Swedish cinema.

Its a swedish top boy/gomorra and THE best swedish portrayal of a crime of life which is the actual daily life of more people in Sweden than ever.

Finally something that feels genuine."
Snabba Cash,Good acting and intense,"Good acting. Real intense and realistic!

Totally not predictable plots.

Can not wait till the next season."
Snabba Cash,Brutal,"I thought Sweeden was a nice place... Boy, was I wrong. But I guess these sorts of dynamics can be found in most countries. Fantastic acting, no blank spots in narrative, acting or continuity."
Snabba Cash,The bitter truth,"One of the best series i have seen !!

Tagically, this is how gang crime works in Sweden.

The series contains excitement, love, betrayal and sadness.

I have no words for how brutally good this series is!"
Snabba Cash,Too many shortcuts taken...,"The story is great and provides many great and realistic scenes. Great ending. This is Stockholm today, huge start up scene and heavy gang violence.

Have to give it to the main stars: really impressed with Alexander Abdallah, Evin Ahmad, Ali Arak, Dada Fungula, Yussra El Abdouni and Z. E. The acting of Z. E was a great surprise. I was worried that he wouldn't cut it, but he did the job well done.

The camera angles and camera work is the best that Sweden has ever seen. Beautiful work!

But there has been way too many shortcuts taken in this series which drastically takes it down from a solid 9.

The small stuff that you notice when watching is eyes moving underneath the eyelid of corpses in the morgue. Like really?! How could you not do a re-take of the scene?? Some smaller roles are casted completely wrong. Those actors are not cutting it.

But it is the lack of a good soundtrack that is what is killing it for me...

The soundtrack of the original trilogy was what made Snabba cash, the Snabba cash we know today. The cynical Latina sound was heavily connected to the cynical story in the films. A starred eye youth heading into a world he's unfamiliar with...

Without a Soundtrack, the series fails to create heavy tension at times (the acting of the main stars made up for it most of the times).

They could have created a soundtrack of either newly created rap specifically for the series (like Top Boy) or a classic sound track of film music.

Here they took some 5-10 years old Swedish YouTube rap music of low quality and ""club rap"". Incredibly naive decision which makes this series not stand out...

Easy to fix for next season though. Really sad to see that it is production mistakes that is what is bringing the rating down. And even more sad because it is Netflix... can't they handle productions?"
Snabba Cash,Thrilling,Not excellence in performance but they're good and the story is perfectly carried out. Didn't expect this kind of jiggery-pokery occurred in a place like Sweden.
Snabba Cash,We need S3,"Loved this.

Season one was excellent, full of action, drama and it really makes you think very differently towards life in Stockholm.

Some fantastic acting throughout and the storyline gets better and better no matter how bizarre.

Season 2 was slick, it followed on nicely from the first introducing a few new faces or side characters getting more time.

There's some negatives but the positives outweigh them. No spoilers, the season does conclude but it does leave some questions so a season 3 would be super interesting and it's by far the realistic life in Sweden or certainly parts of it. You won't regret it."
Snabba Cash,One of the best realistic series,"One of the best swedish series i EVER SEEN.

The actors was amazing and hope it will be a season 2 the realism the crime life stuff like the underground life felt so real!"
Snabba Cash,Rough and refreshing,Great show with minor flaws but overall very good and a great experience.
Snabba Cash,"Lacks realism, cringey dialouge, it's a shame.","First of all, they compromised a lot to make this movie and there's a struggle to find the characters beliveable in many aspects. The original ""Snabba Cash"" is based on the Yugo/Serbian underworld of organized crime, this is pretty pale in comparison. The acting isn't on point, not impressed.

I swear most of these comments about accuracy and realism has to be fake. This should be Fast Fantasies instead of Fast Money."
Snabba Cash,Pretty realistic,"Watch this if you want to get an idea of how Stockholm's criminal underworld is like now-a-days, it's pretty interesting and pretty damn accurate at times, and don't listen to the reviewer below ""aidin-mahjouri"", he has no idea what he's talking about it seems. Criminals in Stockholm (and pretty much every single kid in Stockholm) do speak like that (very heavy slang) and do horrible things and even worse things than you will see on this show."
Snabba Cash,Nailbiting intensity and Marvelous acting,"If you liked series like ""Gomorrah"" or ""top boy"" You are going to love this one. Some of the choices they make are really stupid and makes me think what the heck the writers were thinking. But its a powerful and realistic filmatization."
Snabba Cash,"the best crime TV show at the moment, along Gomorrha","I'm not acquainted with the Snabba Cash film trilogy so I can judge only what I've seen.

If you want to joke about it, Snabba Cash is telling us Stockholm is a city of star-ups and street gangs. The cast is solid and production such that at a certain point you feel the urge to buy a Parajumpers jacket like the one Salim wears in Season 1 and emulate his swagger.

Jokes apart, this is the most potent crime TV show in a while. The only one reaching these heights is Italian Gomorrha.

Snabba Cash offers a bleak insight into the country that offers one of the best standards of living in the world. To make things worse, it asserts that even in Sweden there are no significant differences between crime and business. If you really want to succed you need to outwit your opponents and do whatever it takes to attain the targets you've set.

The show is made to look frightening and powerful, yet rewarding. The single most important lesson you might learn here is not to try to repeat anything you've seen on screen.

There was just a handful minor negative points for me and, interestingly enough, they occurred during the ending of both seasons available at the moment. In Season 1 the very ending is twisting towards a telenovela. In Season 2 the authors played their cards better, so it was just a tad more melodramatic than I'd like.

In terms of IMDb stars, Snabba Cash is at the top of the range."
Snabba Cash,Dark realism meets tension,Comentario no disponible
Snabba Cash,Intense with a realistic feel,"Over all solid acting and script. If you liked Top Boy you will probably like this series. I'm in three episodes and really appreciate it. Cinematography is great. A lot of it takes place in Stockholms ""miljonprogram"" areas (estates/projects) which is juxtaposed with more affluent environments."
Snabba Cash,"Its ok, Leya is dumb","Its a good story, but the Main characters are so hateble. Spesialy the women named Leya. She is so anoying."
Snabba Cash,This is gangster and it's SO good! SEE IT!,"The Swedish are the best in Europe at making crime series. I love it! This one pulls you right in and won't let you go. Fantastic cast, they all nailed it. I had a blast watching this show over three nights. I think the ending was awesome.

As being a part of this crime life myself as a young man, many years ago, I can confirm the authenticity of this show. This is raw, honest gangster life. I'm really impressed. And thank you to all, who were involved in this production, you should all be proud of what you gave us, the viewers. Until next time, cheers! 10/10."
Snabba Cash,A two-hour movie expanded into six episodes,"I have watched the original trilogy a couple of times, which I found to be crime-movie masterpieces, so my expectations for the new Netflix show were high.

Sadly I came away a little disappointed. The premise is okay: a woman with ties to the criminal underwold that she wants nothing to do with, tries to climb the corporate ladder. Things happening in the first episode set off a chain of events, and soon she finds herself in over her head.

Where the movie trilogy left an emotional impact where you either hated or loved the characters who constantly evolved for each movie, most characters here are pretty much cardboard characters.

The original trilogy has amazing side stories, but here... there's almost none of that, and they are underdeveloped. Like the relationship that the protaganist has with one of her female co-workers, who she ends up screwing over.

If you do like SNABBA CASH, and find yourself making it through all episodes, do yourself a favor and watch the original trilogy."
Snabba Cash,A Swedish Gomorra,"I know that's the new fashion since several years now, to make films and series about drug traffic, dealers, suburb ghettos, mafias.... This one is among the best. Realistic, gritty, tough, poignant, suspenseful, and if not action acked, the gunfights sequences and also tortures ones are effective enough to glue you to your coach. The gunfight sequence in the fifth episode is nearly worth HEAT. If you hear closely, take attention to the gunfight sound, as HEAT !!!! The film maker knows what he talks about. The ending may be a real ending or only a path towards a second season. Many features finish this way anyway, and not necessarily films asking for a sequel. We'll see."
Snabba Cash,fun series about everyday swedish immigrant crimelife,"First of all it was surprising they found so many immigrants that have learned both the language and the art of acting in sweden. Production quality is at best mediocre, lots of shaky camera, but not no so much it ruins the series. Very enjoyable view into the swedish immigrant crimelife."
Snabba Cash,Welcome to Sweden,"Realistic serie about what happen, when government close their eyes, don't act and not protect their residents against criminals. Good use with assault rifles and hand weapons. Should be using hand-grenades because that's what criminal part of Sweden is known for. God serie, wonderful actors with passion and skills. Hopefully some important people in Sweden see this, hopefully they can do something about the crime and criminals in Swekistan. This serie should be.mandatory for all high school students and politicians who might be working with people from 3 world countries. Might be the best serie in Scandinavia that shows the truth about how it is."

Wild Wild Country,I grew up in a Cult as a child. This is portrayed perfect.,"The last two years I've been absolutely astonished about the sheer quality of docu-series Netflix has been bringing out. ""Making a murderer"", ""Flint town"", ""The Keepers"", to name a few.

But this one was especially on some level really emotional for me. As I myself was raised in a Indian cult. Not this one, but many aspects are almost identical. I am now 27 and I still struggle on a daily base with many things that were taught to me at such a young age. What struck me was how well portrayed this guy was. The almost hypnotically way he could look, and even walk, got people in some sort of a trance. I myself experienced many times where we saw our ""Guru"" talk, and he had the same aura that also Baghwan has. The other aspect that struck me was them talking about following, but you could feel they actually were all deeply in love with him. A cult leader is not someone you follow, you fall deeply and madly in love with him. This happened to my mother and even after leaving almost 15 years ago, she still can't stop looking to this new love. She never became a stable person again in her life.

The docu itself should be an example to future docu makers. The pacing is nearly perfect. The interviews are well paced, just a few people on different sides, and somehow you all get some sort of attachment to their side of the story. You strongly get the feeling from episode one that nothing is black and white. And that all of these people strongly believed in their cause. There is no one who had the complete truth or did the complete right thing. And Baghwan is equal mysterious in this documentary than in real life. Somehow they don't try to explain the person Baghwan, because you simply cannot explain him. In that way his followers were absolutely right. He is a one of a kind person, and to others he was a con man. For me? He is something in between."
Wild Wild Country,"Yes, watch it. But dont start it at night or you will need a lot of coffee at work the next day",Comentario no disponible
Wild Wild Country,The most crazy documentary I've seen!,"I'm not into cult, but this documentary really blows my mind. Learnt so much history about the town, the religion and the whole process. It gets better and better each episode, couldn't stop watching! It's crazy that this is only back in the 80s."
Wild Wild Country,Orwell's brilliant Animal Farm in real life,"To understand why utopias do not work this provides a fascinating real life example.

A guru who chooses not to speak and allows his followers to take control - Sheela is a brilliant mix of artful aggression and disingenuousness. Her lack of enlightenment by the end is bizarre. The whole purpose of following Osho was supposedly to gain enlightenment. Will the day ever come when she recognises that her need for power created only chaos?

Human nature in all its frailty plays out on film - everyone should see this - and read Animal Farm, which predicted it all decades ago. Slightly overlong which is the only reason it doesn't get 10 stars - but worth staying with as it truly gets weird halfway through."
Wild Wild Country,Fascinating but unsatisfying,"Impressively done documentary that even after 5 to 6 hours still leaves too many questions unanswered. Too much focus on the neighbors, too little on actual life within the commune. Respectful interviewing, but not thorough enough. I'm still very fascinated though. How charismatic must people be and how wonderful the commune life that you don't get absolutely disgusted with the extreme greed of your leader and the aggression of his secretary?"
Wild Wild Country,Never picks a side,"What's great about this show is that it never takes sides, instead shows everyone telling their side and letting you figure out who's lying (lots) and who's honest. I wish there'd been a touch more expansion on the pre and post worlds, but I get that the focus was on the Oregon episode, so it's hardly critical. What was most striking here was how bigoted and clueless the people of Antelope were, how racist and NIMBY. And yet, the cult itself was messed up, so both sides have merit! Find your own truth!"
Wild Wild Country,"Fascinating, Bizarre, Compelling",Comentario no disponible
Wild Wild Country,One of the most fascinating documentaries you will ever see,"It's great to finally see an in-depth documentary on one of the most bizarre events of the late 20th century. What happened at Rajneeshpuram in the 1980s is so extraordinary it's actually difficult to comprehend. The series is well-presented and thoroughly absorbing.

I was amazed at how much video footage they had from inside the commune- I really had no idea this much material even existed. I was also surprised at how much prime time news coverage the story received. The Way brothers should certainly be commended for how much time and research went into this production.

The major problem with the show, as many others have pointed out, is that it does not tell the whole story. In fact, it doesn't even come close. There are many incredibly disturbing stories about what went on in the commune during this time period, the worst of which involve sexual abuse of children. There is information about this online as well as in published books by former sannyasins and commune members. And while it may not be possible to discern exactly what is true and what isn't, there is enough credible evidence to suggest that some very dark events took place under the watch of Rajneesh and his associates.

The two main interviewees, Phillip Toelkes and Jane Stork, fail to discuss these more serious topics and spend a lot of time marvelling over how great a man Rajneesh was. Toelkes in particular is clearly still obsessed with his former guru, to the point where he cannot stop crying every time he mentions his name. It becomes incredibly tiresome and the amount of airtime he gets in this show is inexcusable.

Sheela, however, is a much more interesting character. By all accounts, she has done some terrible things and is arguably lucky to be a free woman but either way, she is fascinating to watch and listen to- both then and now. The documentary would not have had anywhere near as much impact without her presence.

It's hard to know if the Way brothers produced this show with a slight bias towards Rajneesh and his followers or simply that they looked in the wrong places and only found half the story. Either way, this is a great watch but I would highly recommend doing some of your own research to get a more balanced view of things. Christopher Calder's online articles are a great place to start."
Wild Wild Country,"The more one thinks about it, the more insight one gets",Comentario no disponible
Wild Wild Country,Rare insight into 'cult-life',"Although some of the former members dismiss the term cult when referring to the Rajneesh movement, it undoubtedly shows a range of similarities to what might be referred to as a cult. Nonetheless the documentary series Wild Wild Country proofed surprisingly succesful in offering insights that go beyond the taboos and stigmas normally surrounding the subject. Clearly the Rajneesh movement was something that the world had not seen before and the world, perhaps, hasn't seen since.

Focussing around the Indian guru Rajneesh, later known as Osho, the documentary starts off by exploring the very beginning of the movement. Its unorthodox teachings, controversial beliefs as well as its international reach slowly unfold during the first episode of the documentary series. Gradually the focus of the documentary however shifts towards the individuals who circulated within the inner circles of the movement. This inevitably transforms the documentary into an exposition of 'the individual as part of a cult' rather than an exploration of the deeper beliefs of the movement (which at times seem contradictory).

Nonetheless the documentary continues to captivate the viewer as opposition against the movement arises during the cults relocation in Oregon. It is here where the movement encounters more and more opposition which in return fuels the hostility from members towards outsiders. It is not unlike patterns we've seen with cults like the church of Scientology and the Peoples Temple where, once a stark contrast between in- and outsiders has been established, a cult turns violent. The documentary manages to explore the depths of the criminal activities in which the Rajneesh movement was involved without overtly (or excessively) steering its viewers towards a certain point of view. The result is a story that shocks without excessive dramatization.

What makes this documentary worthwhile is the way the story unfolds. Although spread over six different episodes the documentary could be seen as one climactic film in which tension continues to build until it has reached its inevitable climax. Surprisingly the documentary does not necessarily leave one to wonder how people could ever be part of the group, for it also displays the movements admirable qualities. Rather it leaves you to ask how knowledge about the Rajneesh movement could have been absent for you prior to watching the documentary series. If this is the case indeed, then this is a must-watch.

To me personally the appeal of the movements leader remains unclear. This ofcourse could be explained by the lack of insights the documentary offers regarding his background and the very origine of the movement. So yes, the documentary will leave you with many questions. But rather than leaving you with the illusion of presenting the full story, the documentary ignites within you a thirst for knowledge. I guess that is exactly what one might demand from documentaries: the desire to know more."

Wild Wild Country,Fascinating,"I found Wild Wild Country to be a fascinating documentary. It had so many shocking twists and turns, it kept me riveted. Prior to watching this documentary, I had never heard of Bhagwan or the Rajneeshees. The events that transpired are almost shocking enough to be fictional.

The six-part documentary details the story of a group of disciples led by an Indian guru named Bhagwan. It follows their move from India to a rural area in Oregon where they founded a town called Rajneeshpuram. I felt that Bhagwan remained something of an enigma throughout the documentary. Although they did share footage of him, I didn't really get a sense of what his disciples saw in him to cause their devotion. His religious movement seemed to be founded on a philosophy of meditation (although I meditate and so would not call what they were doing meditation, by the way), valuing material wealth, and sexual freedom as a road to harmony. I really did not get Bhagwan's appeal.

That said, the documentary did an amazing job of sharing the progression of Bhagwan's movement over time, the perspectives of three of his disciples, and the impact of the Rajneeshees on the existing community of Antelope, Oregon. I thought the documentary did a fair job of presenting both sides regarding the collision of interests between the Antelope community members and the Rajneeshees. I found it interesting to see how two opposing groups can view the same events with such sharp disparity. As well, it was interesting to see how the Rajneeshees' desire to create a community of peace, love, and acceptance lead to behaviour which embodies the opposite of those goals. Without meaning to offend anyone, from my perspective, it was also such an interesting opportunity to see what people are willing to buy into in order to gain a sense of belonging and meaning in their lives."
Wild Wild Country,"Every opera ends in tragedy, but the parts in between are just so beautiful","Every once in a while you'll come across a story so full of rich details, wonderful characters, and an extraordinary atmosphere, this is one of those.

I have read Osho's books and tried his meditations and have found him full of wisdom to offer but never knew much about his personal life nor this grand experiment that took place in Oregon. I just randomly clicked on this title on Netflix and here is a chapter of Osho's life that captivated me from beginning to end.

You can frame this story in terms of a Master and his relationship to his main disciple Sheela, or a small town's struggle against a massive foreign ideology, or old faith vs. new faith, and it's even reminiscent of the fall of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Whichever way you look at it, it encapsulates the full spectrum of human experience from deep fear to unconditional love. At times you'll see the same bigotry and self-righteousness of the small town folks in yourself and everyone you know then you'll realize they're not the bad guys, they are just simple people like all of us. And at other times you'll see the Messiah complex and power hungriness of the top Sannyasins in yourself as well and realize that they're not in the wrong either, they just wanted to find a paradise and live the way they wanted to. At the end of the day, all characters in the story are redeemed and were just playing out their part in this grand legacy and what a beautiful legacy it was. Sheela may be a deeply faulted character but she was right in saying the whole thing was like an opera- a tragedy in the end but oh so many beautiful moving parts in between."
Wild Wild Country,A film that provokes reflection . . .,Comentario no disponible
Wild Wild Country,Great documentary and an incredibly sad story,"It's kinda funny in a perverse way how people of Antelope were railing about their way of life being destroyed by newcomers without even thinking how Americans destroyed the way of life of Native Americans. The Mayflower mentality, as Sheila put it. If only those hicks had the sense of just leaving them alone and letting those people live their lives the way they wanted, there wouldn't have been any conflict. They never wanted to take over anything, yet every step of the way they were confronted by bigots and racists. And when patience doesn't work, when love doesn't work, when nothing works, what do you do? You devolve into chaos and violence. Very predictable and tragic.

It was really hard for me to watch sometimes, because racism and hatred won, the old white men and women in glasses won, and they keep winning, simply by dragging everyone into their gutter. And an idealistic movement of extreme individualists lost. It was painted as a cult for years and eventually became one. It was painted as a public menace for years and eventually became one. I'm sure it wasn't perfect, and I'm sure it was no paradise on earth, and I'm sure it would have eventually collapsed anyway, as all idealistic constructs do, but why all the hatred? Why do these morality-obsessed people have this insatiable need to tell others how to live their lives and destroy those lives if they don't get their way? Those are rhetorical questions, and the scariest part is that they are as relevant today as they were almost 40 years ago."
Wild Wild Country,Way too long and slow,"Interesting story but so dragged out, it was painful. It would've been better a 2-hour film. Personally got really bad energy from the characters too by the end. I just wanted to stop watching it."
Wild Wild Country,Breathtaking!,"Fascinating documentary series about extraordinary movement of people, interested in finding the meaning in spiritual teachings of Indian Guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (who adopted name Osho at the end of his life). I have not read anything he was teaching, but it is apparent his ""magical"" presence made people fell in love with him. His Oregon-based community was a mixture of a post-hippie ideals of love and freedom and on the other hand, a power-hungry fraction within, which wanted to rule, take-over, dominate, even if it involved crossing the line of law and breaching the utmost ethical principles. The power dynamic and the cash flow is not fully apparent, but the documentary still goes deep. Obviously, there is a lot of fog and grey area, esp. in regard to possibly shady conduct within the community life, as well as on the side of the state, determined to bring the community down, which at times resembled more of a war on beliefs and way on life than solely the enforcement of the law. There are, however, covered many facts and first-hand accounts and the involved individuals uncover their personalities very thoroughly. The vision of building a different and better community was interesting as well as the the enormous power and workforce this group had. As the story unveils, one would expect that American people would be generally interested foremost in enforcing justice while upholding the constitution and principles of freedom, it's not a case at all, at least not there and then. Long before any actual concerns appeared, the attempt to block, expel or destroy this community was fueled by a simple bigotry, hatred and jealousy - mostly due to practices of ""free love"" and wealth this group had accumulated. Regardless of anything else, this strange interest of traditionalist, small-town Christians in other people's sex lives is truly repulsive and despicable, but well-known nowadays and throughout the history. But this is by far not only about that. Even though I loved the series, I believe it could be little more factual. I've spent long hours researching the matters and events afterwards, and learnt so much more, which was not included in the documentary. But the personal accounts of the people involved, which this series is based upon, are indeed very valuable and interesting."
Wild Wild Country,Unnecessarily long,"I was very interested in the documentary because I wanted to get some background for Osho's books, which are still quite popular among some of the people I know.

The main thing I like is that, unlike a lot of other documentaries, it doesn't subconsciously make you take sides by the end of it.

However, it was so unnecessarily long, I kept questioning myself throughout whether I had that much spare time for such a topic. It took me more than a month to finish it, and I still have a feeling of time wasted.

I also can't help to think that some of the important factors were intentionally left out of focus, and they're mostly money-related. Did they try to present it from an angle of an average member? Maybe, felt like that to me."
Wild Wild Country,The crazy and amazing American way,"How a group of people can totally legally and while respecting the constitution and law create a new town with its own name, mayor, armed police, school, etc.. and how because those people live a different way of life with different beliefs (still 100% abiding law citizens) the federal government can by stepping on the law of freedom of individuals/religion and by bending the constitution dismantle this town and prosecute its people.

Really well made and really fascinating documentary about something truly unique.

Had there not been so much real original footage from that time I personally would have not believe this story because of its huge scale and number of people involved.

10/10"
Wild Wild Country,Great subject but not in depth enough,"I loved the subject content, and really could not believe I had not heard about this before. But I did not like how it glossed over subjects, missed information entirely and didn't look into osho enough, it definitely felt biased towards rajneeshes but I loved the interviews and seeing how some people still believed, they definitely had that glassy eyed look and I was fascinated watching them still in total awe of osho and I'm still in awe as to why they can't see the truth.

So 50/50 in my opinion, great subject matter and interesting interviews but for 6 episodes it should have been more in depth."
Wild Wild Country,It's all about where you put the emphasis,Comentario no disponible
Wild Wild Country,"Superb, riveting documentary","In the early 1980s, a guru, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, moves from India to near the town of Antelope, Oregon, USA. He buys a large ranch and sets up a commune for his followers, building an entire city from scratch. The architect and implementer of his plans is his devoted secretary, Ma Anand Sheela. The local townsfolk react badly to their new neighbours, resulting in a very antagonistic relationship between the two sides. Tensions eventually boil over in a series of bizarre events. Eventually, law enforcement authorities, state and federal, get involved.

Superb, riveting documentary. Some of the events are so bizarre that if this wasn't a documentary you wouldn't believe they're true.

Cleverly, engagingly presented: if it was just told in straightforward linear fashion it would be quite dull watching for the first two episodes or so and you would probably give up before getting to the really interesting stuff. Instead, the directors tease you from the word go with interviews that indicate vaguely what will happen down the road, sucking you in to the story.

Very balanced in the way the story is told: there is no narration, everything is told through interviews, newspaper headlines and TV news items. Leaves you to make your own mind up who the good and bad guys are (if, indeed there are any good guys in the story).

Quite emotional towards the end, as you feel a sense of injustice and unnecessary loss.

On the down side, it does take a few episodes for the series to get a good momentum going. The story seemed to drag in the early-middle sections, episodes 2 and 3 or so. It felt a bit over-detailed and could have been trimmed down in that section. The directors labour their point from time to time.

In addition, the teasers that keep you engaged in the early episodes also make you impatient. I kept wanting them to get to the part where it all unravels.

Overall though, an incredibly interesting, thought-provoking and enthralling series."

Black Mirror,Wow,"I just finished Black Mirror and the first word that comes to mind is...wow! I've never seen anything like it. The stories are all shocking, disturbing and thought provoking. Most of them are about how technology is changing, has changed us, and not always for the better. It's almost like a satire of how media obsessed we have gotten. Each episode really makes you think afterwards and will make you want to talk about what happened. Every episode is like a mini movie, there're stand alone episodes and every episode has an incredible cast filled with A-list actors. While everyone will have their own favorite episodes, every single one of them will make you think and there's not a ""bad"" episode in the entire series."
Black Mirror,Message to reviewers..,"You're reviewing the whole show here,not individual seasons or episodes. Don't give a low rating just because you didn't like Miley or the 5th series. Keep everything in context and just rate on your overall impression of Black Mirror. Carry on."
Black Mirror,Doesn't Feel Quite Like Black Mirror Anymore,"I've been a longtime fan of Black Mirror. It had always felt like a modern Twilight Zone with a focus on the potential downsides of future technologies. With season 6 it feels like they threw the premise out the window and went with an anything goes approach to storytelling, including the supernatural. In addition, the overall quality of the writing has declined in seasons 5 and 6. The first 4 seasons of the show is among my favorite TV shows ever, but they seem to have mostly lost their touch.

It's not that the most recent seasons are irredeemable because there are some pretty good episodes, but they are nowhere near the high bar that was set by the early seasons. Don't believe me? Go watch from the beginning and it will become obvious how much the show has changed. None of the newer episodes are remotely close to the quality of ""The Entire History of You"", ""White Bear"", and ""White Christmas."" Even the weaker episodes of seasons 1-4 are significantly better than most of seasons 5 and 6.

I suppose it's nice to get some new episodes of Black Mirror even if it isn't what it used to be, but I was hoping for much better. Despite my misgivings about the last two seasons, I hope there ends up being a season 7 because I am a big fan of the anthology series format. Overall, I still think the show deserves a solid 8 when considering the entirety of the series to this point."
Black Mirror,"RIP Black Mirror, it's all over","This is purely for seasons 1-4 and for Bandersnatch from season 5.

Season 5 was boring and silly. Season 6 is a mixture of terrible episodes and some quite well done episodes that have nothing whatsoever to do with Black Mirror.

Seasons 1 through 4 are masterpieces. Some episodes are better than others, like with any Anthology series. But the good ones are just next-level, even when you have to suspend disbelief sometimes (full nervous system VR systems the size of an M&M - no, not unless everything else is up to the same level of tech!).

It seems that once a series peaks, we just have to accept that that's it, it's done, it will never get up there again. For me the high water marks were CROCODILE, METALHEAD and WHITE BEAR. Though I have to say, I still got back and watch the speech from 15 MILLION MERITS for the thrill of it. It's too good.

4 seasons, 1 special - that's pretty good. Now we need something of equal calibre!

""Somebody"" removes negative reviews so I hope this one will just sail through."
Black Mirror,Mind Blowing,"Black Mirror is one of the most original and best Mini-Series ever created. Each episode tells a different story about the modern world we live in and the technology we all love and while not all, most of them are fascinating. They are all filled with a-list stars and made by great directors. Each stand alone episode is thought provoking and filled with enough drama and suspense to keep you at the edge of your seat. While there are a few episodes that are not as good when compared to the others, most of them are fantastic. This show gets compared to The Twilight Zone a lot and while it's a pretty good comparison, I think Black Mirror is actually a lot better. It's hard to explain how incredible this show is so just go watch it."
Black Mirror,"Fascinating mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy","Amazing British anthology series with a very intriguing concept. The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: ""...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now – and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.""

The resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.

Black Mirror,"Makes me long for more, and sadder that more are not like this.","Brilliant.

Absolutely brilliant.

This is NOT anti-utopian, it is an actual mirror of a utopian idea gone terribly wrong.

I've only watched 3 episodes so far and each one has made me think, made me go back and look again, made me ask myself why this had never occurred to me before.

I would call this sci-fi in the richest sense of the genre.... it is not about science, but how science affects human beings. The one thing that never seems to change is us. Technology evolves, mutates, advances and declines, but human beings, our feelings, our courage, fears, and desires remain within us.

I love this show. I hope you will love it too. And I hope you will think."
Black Mirror,Utterly disturbing in the best possible way,"The double entendre that is Black Mirror's name summarizes the show perfectly. The first interpretation is that the show looks inwards, at the darker aspects of humanity and society. This is done through the theme of technology, hence the second meaning. The black mirror is the screen that rules our lives.

Each self-contained episode is brilliantly crafted and produced. The stories are compelling and the acting is phenomenal. This show is not for those looking exclusively for entertainment, as the episodes leave you with a distinctly empty feeling. Although this is obviously the intent, one cannot help but wonder at the creators' bleak outlook on the world. The presence of bestiality in the first episode could very well deter some viewers, but I would remind them that the show is Twilight Zone-esque in structure as well as theme. The episodes may be watched in any order, as they are all completely independent of one another. The second episode in particular is storytelling of the highest form.

Black Mirror is disturbing in the best possible way. It unflinchingly explores the issues of society through deeply intimate stories and characters and their interactions with technology. Let me be clear, it will not leave you feeling fulfilled. Watching it was an exhausting experience that shook me deeply. The thought provoking subject matter combine with powerful, desolate stories and excellent performances to create one of the most unique and brilliant shows that I have seen. It not only holds the viewer's attention while it plays, it enthralls your thoughts long after the credits roll."
Black Mirror,The best program I have seen in years,"I have only seen the first two installments of this series and but was impressed enough to leave a review. Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead.

I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity.

Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters.

There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture.

Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us."
Black Mirror,Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.,This is the biggest surprise i came across these last couple of years. This series is one of the best i've seen. Every episode is unique yet criticizes the same absurd society we're living in. I was shocked at the great filming/acting/directing and of course writing of these different stories. My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode. I wont miss anything else Charlie Brooker does and i'm patiently waiting for the DVD to come out. I hope this also gets a Blu-Ray version and maybe some new episodes after wards?
Black Mirror,"It Could have been a 10, but...","...season five was bad (episode 1), mildly acceptable (episode 2) and are you kidding me? (episode 3). Miley Cyrus? This series started out as an inventive, original and disturbing show. When it became ""Americanized"", it went downhill fast. Please, either return to the original premise, or don't put out more trash."
Black Mirror,One of the best TV shows.,-1 because of that Season 5 that I wished I never knew existed.

Black Mirror,Series 6 a huge drop in quality,"Latest series is on the rails, by the book, it almost feels like series 6 has been written by AI.

Hold on. Is that going to be the final twist - that Charlie Brooker got ChatGPT to write series 6? That would explain the lack of plot twists and the by-the-numbers predictability.

If Charlie Brooker is playing 4D chess and has willingly created a poor series 6 to make a brilliantly executed point to the suited streamer overlords that AI cannot create as well as humans, then hats off to him. I'll revise this review to an 11/10.

But if that's not the case, then what did happen between series 5 and 6?"
Black Mirror,Everyone's nightmare,If you watch this whole series...you can see the reality of it...and it's horrifying. I believe that this series really makes you think about how easily and fast things can get out of control. It was an awesome show!
Black Mirror,"Disturbing? Yes, it's ""Black Mirror""","I found myself irritated with one of the reviewers who gave this mini-series a terrible review because it left him feeling ""disturbed"". Ermm.... I think that's the intention....

As many others have pointed out, the series is superbly put together: the actors are great; the script, if anything, is minimalist and the production excellent.

This isn't reality TV. This picks out the darkest aspects of how are future in this this modern age could end up, in extremis....

Personally, I think it's a Facebook/Twitter/Flickr/Android/iPhone/Tab/internet horror story and whilst I think it's probably too brutal for most people, it is a reflection of how we give up and of ourselves to the digital, overwhelmingly public way that the world now wants us to be.

I love the show. Will it change my FB or other behavior? No but, truth be told, I might be watching out of the corner of my eye...."
Black Mirror,Brilliant and disturbing,"Watching it was disturbing and shocking at the same time.

Depressive in a way, but also genius and defying! The way it makes you question and think about reality and our modern technological ages it's brilliant!

And although being fictional and mostly sci-fi, it's so realistic in the scariest way!

It's not about tech... it's about us and our ""human nature"", the good and the bad, our best and worst as humans and that is definitely the most disturbing aspect of it all.

Worth seeing it all with detailed attention cause it's probably one of the most intelligent and critical TV series done recently!!

Thank you Mr Brooker and all the team!

P.S.: the first two episodes are probably the most disturbing ones and it's curious that all the bad reviews focus only in the first one... Reading those bad reviews only make more sense to the all series idea... Shocking uh? But wouldn't we be all in the pub watching it?"
Black Mirror,Genuinely Amazed With the Pilot and What Followed.,"To sum up this series for me is quite easy, It's a dark look at what could be, and a very deep look at the worst of human nature.

The cast and set are different every time, but one theme I found recurring was that each episode was extremely haunting, and it definitely gets the viewer thinking about what could be if the world was just a little bit different. I don't think Black Mirror will appeal to everyone because some themes are a slightly uncomfortable especially in the pilot episode. So far the actors that have been cast have done an amazing job, and the writers have managed to make some far fetched ideas seem graspable. Basically this series is unlike anything else on TV and for that it gets a big thumbs up from me.

I don't want to write any spoilers, but what I will say is this if you want a drama with dark twist or a series that is completely Original make it Black Mirror."
Black Mirror,A Game Changer Show,"In the new golden age of tv shows, this one is on another level. That's saying something, considering the expectation we have now. Black Mirror is an anthology series that, if you follow dope stuff, has achieved that rare-air status that if there's another season you feel blessed. It's that good imo. Absolutely a 21st Century version of The Twilight Zone. And it keeps coming back, but on nobody's timeline. And A list stars just flock to it?! I don't really love each and every episode. But there are so many episodes of this program that really leave ya shaken. Because us doesn't seem that far removed from a plausible scenario. Check it out. It'll make ya wonder......"
Black Mirror,"""Just skip the first episode...""","When I talk about this show I always tell people to ""Just skip the first episode and watch it at the end."" Other than that it's a mind blowing, ground breaking, and terrifying series. It shows exactly where humankind is currently heading and has already reached in some instances. A mirror can only show a reflection of what's already there so Black Mirror is an apt title.

I've watched all the episodes multiple times and wish like crazy they had continued the show. It was one of the truly rare shows willing to take an unflinching look at humanity and how screwed up it is, and how much worse it's getting. In my experience, those who don't like the show seem to prefer living with their head in the sand while humming loudly to drown out the noise. Ignorance doesn't change the world, seeing it for what it is and then choosing to be better is what can do it."
Black Mirror,Definitely worth seeing!,"This is truly an amazing show. The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. The stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. What makes ""Black mirror"" so great is the attention to detail and inter/intrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world. Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. It asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing! Treat yourself and watch this. 9/10"
Black Mirror,Disappointing Season 6,"Black Mirror has always been one of my favourite shows. It is completely different from everything else. It has been fresh, quirky and gripping in every respect. Every episode has been different and has transfixed me. It is now described as a Netflix original. It was on U. K TV years before it got to Netflix.

I have been anxiously awaiting the release of season 6 which I've just binge watched over a couple of days.

I was quite disappointed in Season 6 with some episodes having a familiar ring to them where I've seen very similar themes before, even in previous episodes.

The best episode of season 6 from my perspective was episode 2 Loch Henry which was scary, original and brilliantly acted. Overall I found season 6 patchy and disappointing."
Black Mirror,This is not Black Mirror,"I COULDNT tell i was watching black mirror through the whole 6th season. All the time I was waiting for that mind-f black mirror moment and plot where i really pause to process but I didn't get any.

On joan is awful Salma presence felt like she was shooting a commercial rather than filming TV and wro wasn't strong.. such a waste for the amount of talented actors and actresses in 1 episode.

On the Loch henry, it really felt just like watching a documentary, any random documentary only showing you behind the scenes except for the ending.

Mazey Day, was a Don't Look Up wannabe TV which is very mediocre.

I don't know what's happening to the show but bring us Black museum, white Christmas, Nosedive, White bear, Playtest creators...

chatGBT, TikTok, Crypto, Podcasts...all of these addictive concepts and you went with a documentary..."
Black Mirror,"A unique and different tv experience, with an episode for everyone.","Black Mirror is an anthology, meaning it is complied of different sci fi tales to make their seasons. This means the series doesn't really have any synopsis I can say, the only thing I can say is just watch the bloody show already. Every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. As far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like Jon Hamm, Daniel Kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. Every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. I would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. Smithereens was great, so was Andrew Scott's performance. So yes, a masterpiece still, I won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. So ignore season 5 apart from Smithereens, Smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. Think of it as a mix of mini films. Now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. There 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. And the Christmas Special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. But if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, Bandersnatch. An. Interactive. Film. You choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. So please, If you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed. Verdict: With something new every episode, Black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways. A+"

Key & Peele,Left Us Wanting More,"There was a void in Comedy Central after ""Chappelle's Show"" ended and, while I don't want to say that ""Key and Peele"" completely filled it, they sure helped me not notice the absence as much. ""Key and Peele"" were gut-busting hilarious and YouTube users have enjoyed them by the millions. It sucks they only gave us four years, but like they say: ""Leave them wanting more."""
Key & Peele,wooooow,"It can get a little repetitive...but that's precisely why it doesn't have that many seasons

the dedication and the quality of the sketches...mind-blowing!!

And that is really not capturing the true brilliance of key and peele

i feel like i can't pick the right words

les mis!! Fantastic!!

The cinematography on each sketch is just mind-blowing...the only reason i don't give this a 10 is because it's a sketch show and some sketches are not too great some over-the-top even for a sketch comedy...only that...the rest is just masterclass..."
Key & Peele,Clever and Ahead of it's time,"I was a bit afraid when I saw the teasers but blown away by the production value! Comedy is not just something to make you laugh. Comedy has levels to it watching Key & Peele I saw tragedy, Irony and humanity. There have been very few thought provoking comedy shows that have made me copy and paste youtube links and mail them to my friends. Key & Peele have somewhat tedious dialogs about their humdrum lives (sorry guys) But their comedic insights are brilliantly creative and should be revisited as ongoing themed webseries. I swear Jordan Peele is so dedicated to his scenes that his focus alone makes me laugh. This show is incredible and I search for new episodes of it in my comedy central on demand. Keep up the good work guys"
Key & Peele,Key and Peele make SNL look like the worst episode on Sesame Street,"Key and Peele make SNL look like the worst episode on Sesame Street.

If these two where put on earth to do this series and that's it, we've been blessed.

This is top shelf comedic brilliance in every aspect. The quality of the skits is outstanding. I'm shocked how they fit so much entertainment in 30 min. Yet it leaves me smiling all day. Even the extra actors in the skits have better acting skills than most of the hosts on SNL.

Good days or bad days, these guys make me laugh.

My only complaint is that I wish each episode was at least 60 min.

And very sad this legendary series is over."
Key & Peele,An absolutely brilliant series!,"This is and always will be one of the greatest sketch comedy shows ever. It's brilliant and practically perfect. The writing is smart, insightful and hilarious. But best of all, actors Key and Peele are chameleons who vanish into an infinite number of characters with a wide range of different personalities, and that's what makes this show work. Even the best writing can fall flat if the actors aren't up to the challenge. Those two are pitch perfect in every single sketch."
Key & Peele,Best sketch comedy show I've seen since Chappelle's Show,"I saw their ""I Said Bitch"" skit a few months ago when one of my friends shared it on Facebook. It caught me off guard with how clever, perfectly-timed, well-acted, multi-dimensional, and downright funny it was. I told myself that I would definitely start watching this showbut my hectic schedule caught up with me, and it faded from my memory before I was able to set aside time to watch one episode.

But the videos kept going viral on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, and after clicking on ""McFerrin vs. Winslow,"" ""Ultimate Fighting Match Preview,"" ""Yo Mama Has Health Problems,"" and ""Gay Marriage Legalized,"" I was hooked! Next thing I know, I was ripping through episodes on Hulu, and posting and emailing episodes to my friendsI was even pulling co- workers into my office and telling them, ""You HAVE to watch this sketch RIGHT NOWit's only 4 minutes long.""

This is the closest production I've found to Chappelle's Show, although the comparison isn't exactly fair. Chappelle's Show was outrageous and far beyond the bounds of anything anyone had seen on TV before (not taking away from the fact that it was extremely creative, witty, and funny), leading to ROTFLMAOs. Key and Peele is a bit more subdued, and much of its humor lies in its subtext. You'll still get a few ROTFLMAOs, but a lot of the laughs may just be LOLs, or smirks. Not every skit is a hit, but the producers manage to cut the less-funny skits before they get annoying, unlike Saturday Night Live (again, an unfair comparison because that show is live, while Key and Peele is pre- taped and edited).

Key and Peele are both extremely witty, charismatic, and talented comedians and actors. I enjoy their two-man stand up (I think it's a successful formula, when you have the right team), and watching the entire episodes actually allows you to enjoy the episodes more than simply watching them on YouTube because the setups often give you additional insight. Dave Chappelle used to do the same thing successfully. Peele's imitation of President Obama is impressive, and the ""Anger Translator"" skits are hilarious. I can't wait until Season 3.

Key & Peele,My seasonal ratings,"Key and Peele is a highly clever and hilarious sketch comedy series. It feels like a descendent of Chappelle's Show. Some of the skits are legitimately the funniest things I've ever seen in my laugh. Many of them having me crying from laughter. I love this show.

The show does dip in the later seasons. In the future I will only rewatch the first three seasons.

Season 1: 9 stars (about 4 viewings, 7/12/2023)

This show is amazing. There are multiple times per episode where I have to pause it because I'm laughing too hard. So creative. And they're both so awesome and naturally funny.

Season 2: 8 stars (about 4 viewings, 7/15/2023)

The misses are more common but the hits are just as strong. I love when they show crowd reactions when someone is dying from laughter.

Season 3: 8 stars (about 4 viewings, 7/24/2023)

Season 4: 6 stars (about 3 viewings, 7/31/2023)

This season has a few hilarious sketches, including my favorite KP sketch, Consequences! But more than half are either misses or just mildly amusing without laughter. And I miss the crowd. The car conversations rarely make me laugh.

Super Bowl Special: 6 stars (about 2 viewings, 8/1/2023)

Season 5: 4 stars (about 2 viewings, 8/11/2023)

More misses and very few hits. It's difficult to get through."
Key & Peele,"Started out slow, keeps getting better",Comentario no disponible
Key & Peele,Genius,"I'm not saying it's perfect. Genius is not equal to Perfect. It's a little hit and miss... and yet I feel it deserves a '10'.

I think it deserves this because these guys (and their writers, natch!) have stumbled upon a wondrous land of infinite possibility. Not many people attain to this; which restriction is also an indicator of true artistry. From top to bottom, the produced sketches reek of talent and inspiration. From conception to writing to directing to acting... We are treated to comedy on blue-flame fire. It's head humor, it's body humor, it's slapstick, it's transcendent, it's bestial.

It'll be interesting to see how long ComCent lets it run.

And, btw, I PREFER the new format (using road trip bits as ligature).

Highlights: S04E03; Georgina and Esther (*gotta* watch it uncensored!). S04E10; The scat duel (brutally mocking and lovingly homaging the tradition at the very same time!).

I'm looking forward to K&P continuing on an upward trajectory... Forever and Ever, AMEN."
Key & Peele,two new voices,"This is an American TV sketch comedy show created by MadTV alumni, Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. As with most of this genre, each skit is a bit hit and miss. There are a few that is hilarious although I probably laughed more with MadTV. A couple has even reached cultural pinnacle of the moment. There is something insightful and imaginative with Obama's anger interpreter. It's a show of a moment in US history. It is a show which announces the arrival of two important voices. It's a show of cultural importance. It's a smart show that makes you think. It doesn't hurt that it's good and these guys seem like the best of friends."
Key & Peele,The Thief of Though.,"In the current state of movies and TV shows, executives try their best to appeal to a demographic obsessed with authenticity and genuine absurdity with purpose. With that being a handicap for some, most writing leans more toward absurdity for the sake of being absurd for no reason. When that happens, the line between genuine originality and simple stupidity becomes blurred. However, this show is the perfect polar opposite. Key and Peele manage to merge genuine ridiculousness with unparalleled brilliance. This show is sheer genius cloaked behind sheer nonsense which makes it the quintessential candidate that will represent absurdity and brilliance alike, and without prejudice. The very thing Shakespeare once held true himself."
Key & Peele,Funny but superficial,Comentario no disponible
Key & Peele,When taking jokes too far goes wrong...,"I really want to like this show more that I do. As pure comic talents, Key & Peele are great. They possess natural comedic talent and they are both very likable. The problem is that every skit devolves into yet another joke taken way too far. While the ideas and premises are mostly good, the skits are written such that the joke is revealed within the first 15 seconds and then exhaustingly repeated over and over and over until it has been milked to the point at which it is no longer funny, rather, it has become annoying and tiresome.

I remain convinced that these guys can do so much better and frustrated that they have yet to do so."
Key & Peele,Masterful comedy series!,I had already seen this several years ago or so for some reason I didn't review then. I absolutely love the humor throughout it's legendary entertainment that is well deserving of the award wins! Keegan Micheal Key and Jordan Peele are so wonderful throughout in this sketch comedy. I think it's great Jordan Peele became a masterful horror director a couple years after this ended. So many awesome comedic scenes that are loads of fun and memorable; some are stale yet sill effective. Maybe one of few things people would complain about is the racial issue enlightened in this but that's a great thing especially that Jordan is known for.
Key & Peele,In the pantheon,"Key and Peele are the most acerbic, gutsy, and funny duo on American television today. In fact, comedy duos seem to be a lost art form in the United States (gone are the days of Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, and Martin and Lewis). Perhaps, that's why Key and Peele seems fresh, while at the same time, hearkening back to pre-war era comedy. The writing is heavy on satire, but the performances are rife with pratfalls. In an era of snark and ironic distance, it's invigorating to watch a comedy in love with the execution of a sketch, not just the target of a joke. The cinematography also elevates the show above the usual crop, with its filmic look and splendid editing. Noting about this show is slapdash (Judd Apatow improv, this ain't). The show's writing and performing is deliberate and the dividends are many! Highly recommended."
Key & Peele,Comedy gold,Is by far my favorite TV show of all time it so funny my favorite season is 5 key and peele work great together it had great and funny and happy ending I give a+
Key & Peele,Best if they made fun of famous news and clips,"Some stuff like ""I got shot in the penis"" was just wrong, but the ""Racoon not Zombie bite"" and ""Unicorn Sighting"" are very good! They take famous you tube clips, movies, and news and creates a spoof off of them. However I miss the ""Bad Luck"" skits and ""Deal of no Deal"" spoofs on Mad TV. The on stage jokes and skits that were done in front of an audience need a lot of work on, it can be funny from time to time however they tend to be stretched from what actually happened, for example, how key talks about how he cant sit in his seat while he laughs on a plane. Needs work but it seems like there is a lot of potential for this show."
Key & Peele,Not bad but needs a few changes...,"At first when I heard of a Comedy sketch show starring 2 bi-racial (half black-half white) guys who's sketches coincide with them being bi-racial, it didn't sound too appealing.

However, I saw a small clip of ""Key & Peele"" on Conan and found the clip to be very funny. So, I decided to catch it on TV.

To my surprise, I was not disappointed. Not all of it is laugh out loud funny but it does make you smirk and at times you do indeed laugh out loud. The opening sequence was hilarious.

""Key and Peele"" do grow on you. That being said, there is still a lot of work needed. For example, cutting out the whole stand-up bit they do in front of a live audience in between sketches.

The show should be purely a sketch show. Much like Portlandia. It is the same concept for Portlandia except for that it is the ""black version"".

The show is funny to all demographics especially black and white Americans which I believe was the main aim.

I will definitely be watching the next episode."
Key & Peele,"Not hit and miss, but hit hit HIT miss hit....","I first thought these guys were soo stupid, but when you see a couple of their great skits, it makes you kinda GET their humor, so pretty much all of the skits are funny in their own way. If one skit doesn't hit, 3 others do, and they have plenty of great and/or iconic characters, Obama and Luther, Meegan and Andre, Cedric and Levi, Wendell, and who could forget the Continental breakfast guy? Whether they are tackling race issues, or just being stupid, these guys are great. My favorite skits are: Two old Church ladies vs Satan, the East/West bowl, Stan Lee, Luther and Obama going away, Levi's lightning in a bottle, Wendells superman bed, Andre breakups with Meegan, Teris on a plane, and the parole puppet."
Key & Peele,A spiritual successor to Chappelle's show....minus the spirit,"Key and Peele are both great at comedy. This show definitely shows how talented they both are at writing and acting. They are insightful and thought provoking at times. With this show they tap into the millennial generations psyche. So why do I feel a bit hollow watching this show?

Having spent the better part of a decade trying to figure out why, I think I figured out the issue. This has been done before - and better. The show (compared to Chappelle's Show) lacks bite or any form of social anger, despite the consistent theme of being a black person in the USA. The sketches are good for the most part but you will be left wondering 'could they have gone further with it?'.

On reflection, the Key and Peele show is a sketch show by two people who make commentary but are hesitant (at least at the time because Peele has gone on to make movies that hit the point home much more than this show does) to commit fully to their own comments. They would rather make the audience laugh the pull away in shock. That is why at times this good show can feel rather formulaic."
Key & Peele,The sketches are the best,"The stand-up parts of the show aren't that great, but the sketches are always hilarious. I normally skip the stand-up show, but its the sketches that really make it worth watching. Key and Peele is definitely my favorite sketch show, despite the lackluster stand-up in between. Sketches come across really well over a screen, but for stand-up you really just need to be there in the room. It loses a lot if you're not. They make some of the funniest sketches I've ever seen though. They're always very funny and very high quality. A lot of work goes into the design, the sets, the costumes, the characters, even the acting; its all very well crafted. And the humor is very on point. Its a shame the shows no longer running, hopefully someday it comes back."
Key & Peele,Its hard making a sketch show...,"Remember a guy named Dave Chappelle? Take him and dilute his blackness between two guys and you have Key and Peele.

The show is designed exactly the same as a lot of other shows focused around one or two people; quick stand-up bits between skits. This being said, the show is pretty good. Its not all laughs all the time but when they nail a joke they really do NAIL it.

If you like racial humour mixed with truly creative writing (in the skits at least) then you should probably watch the first few episodes. The only bad thing about this show is the over-scripted and frankly very awkward stand up bits in front of the audience. Good show, good guys, bad stand-up. The skits are way to good to stop watching this show just cause of a little bad stand-up (which they might figure out SUCKS later on) i'll keep my digits crossed."
Key & Peele,Acting funny isn't being funny and these guys try to act funny as opposed to being funny,One of the worst sketch comedies of all-time definitely not madtv or chappelle show so how anybody ever thought these guys were funny is beyond me but this show sucks donkey balls
Key & Peele,"Really, really good...but by season 5, it was time to move on.","I never watched ""Key and Peele"" during its first run on TV. My oldest daughter finally convinced me to watch it, and I was thrilled to see it's currently on HBO Max and I really enjoyed the show. Many of the skits are terrific and are hilarious. However, I should add a caveat. The longer the series was made, the weaker the skits...particularly by its final season, season five. Because of this, I'd rate the early seasons a 10 and the later ones 5 or 6...the drop in quality was THAT noticeable. So, my recommendation is that if you watch, start at the beginning and don't watch the later episodes until you are hooked...otherwise you might just assume the show isn't all that great."
Key & Peele,Seminal and hilarious,"Key and Peele is incredibly funny! With any sketch show, you usually describe them as ""hit-and-miss"", however this breaks the mould and is 95% hit. Both Key and Peele are just very naturally funny people, and their chemistry is second-to-none. A lot of the best sketches centre around race, with no holds barred. They are unapologetic in their humour, tackling issues big or small with subtle satire which invariably develops into absurd, sophomoric, and slapstick humour.

It must be said that the best sketches do come early on in the show, as might be expected. Nonetheless, series 4 and 5 have some excellent, very quotable, sketches which stand the test of time.

If you haven't seen this show, but enjoy ""silly"" humour, then this is a must watch."

The Mole,Enjoyable but pointless,"Let me start off by saying that the show has a great hook and I enjoyed it quite a bit.

My problem came around half way through when I realized that the mole didn't really have a role. The mole can't be eliminated, the mole can't win, and the mole doesn't have to sabotage because 1. They gain nothing from it and 2. Everyone else is already busy sabotaging to draw attention to themselves. There's no point keeping track of who might have sabotaged consistently because the motives are all wrong.

The most frustrating thing is that the mole literally CANNOT win or lose, NOTHING is at stake. Someone is just going to walk away with a bunch of money at the end.

Lastly, I wish they would show more of the conversations between the characters so that we as viewers can feel closer to them and develop favorites etc. Nothing is at stake for the viewers either, because we don't get to care about the characters."
The Mole,A lot of copy paste from the mole Belgium season 9,"I am a huge fan of the original series: The mole Belgium (De Mol), that is running since 1998 and has 10 seasons and more to come.

Also I like the Dutch version (with celebrities), Wie is de mol? Which has done 20+ seasons.

Now I am enjoying this Netflix version set in beautiful Australia. The landscapes and locations are great, the group not so much. They are a bit to sporty, goodlooking and ""in to it"" for my taste. I would have loved a more diverse group, different body types etc.

The games and missions look very familiar is you're a The Mole Belgium fan, a lot is copied from season 9, which was set in Germany.

The part that's missing for me is the interaction between the contestants on location, that is we're the original series is so strong, you really live with the kandidates and can do your own mole search."
The Mole,Entertaining but obvious,Comentario no disponible
The Mole,The best reality show in years,"Loved every minute of this show.

What makes this show stand out from others is how engaged you get in it. Instead of passively watching, I found myself making notes during each episode.and got totally hooked into this world of trying to work out who the mole is. I don't believe it's obvious at all. My mind was changing with every episode and there were a few gasping in shock moments throughout.

The contestants are fun and have personality. The scenery is beautiful and the challenges are interesting and make you think. I don't watch much reality tv but this was my favourite by far. Really hope they make a 2nd season! Give it a go. You'll probably know by the end of the first episode if you'll like it or not."
The Mole,The Mole Has Returned With A Vengeance,"Back in the day of roughly 20 years ago, two of my favorite shows on US TV were The Amazing Race and The Mole. While The Amazing Race has continued to have tremendous success for the past two decades, The Mole was sadly cancelled after only a few seasons. So I was pleasantly surprised to see it pop up on Netflix recently after not knowing ahead of time that it would be returning.

So how did it turn out? Overall I'm happy to say that it had plenty of intrigue and fun challenges. The contestants were hit and miss in terms of entertaining to watch, but that is true of all reality and game shows. There were some nice surprises along the way as well. Of course, nothing is perfect. The identity of The Mole became undeniably clear to me with about 3 episodes to go, and there were too many obviously scripted interviews with the contestants during each episode, particularly with contestants making mole accusations. I would have liked to have seen more natural interaction among the contestants in between challenges instead.

That said, it's hard to complain too much about what we got. Even with its flaws, this is still a far superior reality show compared to much of the trash reality shows that are on modern TV. It's not quite up to The Amazing Race standards, but then again that's not a realistic expectation. It's a quality season one reboot, and I'm hoping for another season with a few adjustments in the right direction to make season two even better."
The Mole,"I was initially glad to see a revival, but there's some issues","The revival doesn't hold a candle to ABC's Season 1 & 2. I feel a lot of the cast members are caricatures and the production team's edits are very suspect (such as the countdown clocks, contestant confessionals, and how the missions are structured). In contrast to earlier seasons, we really don't get a full sense of the competitors' motivations. I really can't say that I'm rooting for any particular player to bring home the prize money. The show is a way to eat up my time; I'm not as fully engaged in it as I thought I would be. This is because very few of the missions are exciting. Many of the games have ambiguous rules or just seem downright impossible. I felt lost when I tried to make sense of some of them, especially the Detonator mission and the bank heist mission.

Alex Wagner is a fair host. She has a good mixture of motherly warmth and seriousness. I can't rate her as highly as host Anderson Cooper, who incidentally also is a journalist.

The aforementioned ABC seasons were set in France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, and Monaco. This season in Australia simply doesn't have that same spark.

It's just another scripted reality show. Watch at your own leisure but be prepared to be let down."
The Mole,The best reality show today!,"As a huge fan of the original The Mole series, I was so excited to find out that Netflix brought it back. Of course, I was also worried that they would screw up the show like most reboots these days, but thankfully they didn't. The new host (Alex) is both enjoyable and fun, and the diverse set of contestants were all likeable and all suspicious at some points. Also, it was interesting how it was in Australia this time, which broadened the scope of the game. Unlike other reality shows, this show makes the viewers suspicious and play along, and the producers do a good job at throwing us in various directions to throw us in various directions.

I really do hope we get more seasons and that Netflix promotes this show more, because it's really well made and it's a fan favourite and I didn't even know it was back until a friend mentioned it.

My only feedback for (hopefully) next season - is I hope they get a better actor/actress for the Mole, and that they give the Mole some stake in the game as well (e.g. Maybe the money that's lost from the pot, actually goes to the Mole, which gives them better incentive to be more discrete and shady lol)

Great job Netflix, the producers and the cast!"
The Mole,Addictive Concept but Missed Connection,"First let me say I've come to love ""reality"" television - that while it's over-the-top at times, the sense that a real human is behind the screen draws me into their story. I also love spy shows and mysteries. So I was pumped about this show, and the first several episodes had me hooked. There were so many characters sabotaging, the Australian views were incredible, and there was a fun energy in the cast. Above all, I wanted to see if my prediction about the mole was right, so I kept watching.

But, a small missing piece grew into a gaping disconnect when I realized that 6 or 7 episodes in, I knew NOTHING about these people. I saw no footage of them interacting during down times that weren't missions or quizzes to see their personalities come to life. Their confessionals were SOLELY about the mole and the missions, nothing else, so I knew nothing about their lives outside of the game. We didn't get to watch them interact off-script, and that started to feel empty.

""The Mole"" needed Survivor-esque moments where a player catches two people forming an alliance, or finds them plotting. What about times where characters get to read letters or watch video from their family? Why are these people on this show? The ""real"" drama was just missing here, as was character building. By the end, I found I didn't care who won the money. And once it became more obvious who the mole was, the show dragged - it appeared the contestants felt that as well.

I hope they continue and build the concept, but if it continues as only a game show without any ""real"" people or vulnerability, I don't see this lasting beyond another season."
The Mole,"If you weren't impressed by s1, watch s2!!!","The second season of this show is undeniably better than the first. I hated the way the mole played in that one but this one was genius!!! I really hope they keep changing the location. I find that to be a really enjoyable part of the show!

The cast is awesome and everyone is deceitful and selfish which makes it incredibly hard but fun to guess who the Mole is! Your guess will probably change after every episode with the way these challenges go 🤣

What a fun show. I'm so happy that Netflix did a reboot of this. I never knew how much I missed this until I saw it on Netflix! Can't wait till the next season to see where they play next!"
The Mole,Room for improvement,"I don't think it's bad. I do think they fall into some of the same pitfalls that plague so many other reality shows.

The weird thing is that this version is very clearly based on the latest Belgian run (some games are almost literal copies) but they don't quite get why that version is superior.

* You barely see people interacting when not playing a game.

* The constant skipping to the interviews/contestant voice overs make it seem very scripted. They need to limit those. Let the action and interactions speak for itself.

* Notebooks! Bring back the notebooks!

* Diversity. What you have is a group of people from a fairly narrow age range (25-40) who all look like they could start a modelling career and whose hobby is cross fit. Diversity is more than a bunch of attractive millennials with a different skin color. The Belgian runs have people between 18 and 50+. It's their personalities and different experiences that bring so much more to the game.

* I do like the use of cell phones instead of the large screen they use in the Belgian version.

* I didn't like the ""ending on a cliffhanger"" of the episodes. Why does everything have to end on a cliffhanger? Just finish after the selection. It destroys the pacing of the episodes because the elimination should be the emotional high point of the episode. Not the lead in.

* More of a personal note but the Belgian presenter, Gilles de Coster, has a very dry, factual way of interacting with the contestants during the games. I think that works better than Alex Wagner's.

If you want to see how good it can be, try and find the current Belgian version (especially series 9 (Germany) )."
The Mole,Engaging and easy to watch,Comentario no disponible
The Mole,Wasted potential,"I really hope someone in charge of making this series is reading this. I get that you choose selfish people for this show to make it interesting and also throw the viewer off but this is no longer a fun watch. Genuine people getting screwed over by a majority of selfish individuals that don't even care about the money! This game should be about winning, sure but also empathy and TEAM effort and respect. All of these shows only showing us how ugly people get in order to win- doesn't even matter whether there's money on the line or not... please cast less of the corporate screw over type. It's unfair und really sad to watch people who don't care about anything win this show at all costs. It hast potential but this is just a sad representation of human ""nature"" bred by a capitalist society."
The Mole,Half of those people are actors,"If you look up those so called contestants, half of them are legit actors. You can look it up yourselves right here on imdb. Has tv really got so bad that producers think people will just eat up every trash thats thrown at them. Where is the ambition?

Everything on this show feels so over the top and completely out of touch with how real people talk. Even the acting is just ridiculously bad. The audacity to think anyone would think this is okay just baffles me.

Hopefully canceling this show will show future producers that trying to use real people for a reality show might be worth the risk. Even tho the drama wont be as forced."
The Mole,Great psychological challenge of who done it,"I work in sales and like reality TV shows to test my understanding of human behavior.

Most reality TV shows I watch are team sports with the audience solving who is going to work together and who isn't. The mole involves team dynamics too but is more an individual sport based on knowing who the mole is.

That means the players and the audience really have the same goal and are playing the same game.

That said, its pretty hard to catch someone in a lie, from what I've read we only have 50/50 odds on reading truthful behavior. Even if we catch the lie, someone could be pretending to be the mole and now we're trying to read intentions too. I believe the odds are against the audience figuring who the mole is. But its fun trying so I give this show 10/10."
The Mole,Second season please,"I really, really enjoyed watching The Mole. The fun part is not only the challenges, but also deciding who the mole is. I thought this show is inspired by Among Us but actually, it's a revival of the same 2001 reality contest show of the same name.

First, the challenges are fun except for that lame Two Truths and One Lie episode.

The host is really fun and great, and almost all of the contestants are suspicious and it's really quite hard to determine who the mole is because everyone can screw up during missions and it's either an honest mistake or a mole behavior.

I do want a second season and hopefully the challenges can be as fun and challenging as the first season."
The Mole,What a setting...!,"Having not watched The Mole before and not being that big on Reality shows I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this was. From the casting, production value, concept and intrigue, it really was great and worth a recommendation. Travelling around Australia was absolutely beautiful too!

A fantastic premise that will have you loudly guessing who The Mole is from start to finish and you won't know who it is till the very end.

Here's hoping we get another season with a similar budget. The on location filming really made this a spectacle for both Australia as a travel destination but also as a way to really emphasis the adventure they're all on.

I'm ready for season 2!"
The Mole,No catch phrase?,"No one saying ""Who is...the Mole?""

It's okay. But missing some of the elements that made the first ones so great. A better host to amp the suspense. Where are their handy dandy little notebooks they were always writing in?! I remember them always writing notes in their little notebooks. Also the phones instead of a big screen is a bad choice. The huge screen was fun to see turn color.

Overall I am glad it is back. But don't ditch the things that made it so good the first time.

I really miss Anderson Cooper, though I get her has other things to do. But the host could really do a better job of saying things to build suspense, etc."
The Mole,The best,"I normally hate reality shows or game shows but this was so engrossing I watched it within 2 days. I loved it! All the players were perfect for the show and it had me guessing the whole time. I constantly was changing who I actually thought the mole was. I need another season! I highly recommend watching this show if you need something to watch, are bored or love mystery/psychological shows! Best game show I have watched in years. The winner also deserved it, they put their all in every challenge. My favourite on the show was Joi, I won't spoil if she won or not or was the mole but she was the best!"
The Mole,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, this reboot isn't a patch on the Australian version from the 2000s. Whilst very attractive, the cast blatantly ticks off boxes to attract/ repel certain demographics and are blandly portrayed (to their detriment). The over produced, slick vibe doesn't allow the viewer to feel like they're ""working out"" who the mole is but instead, careful editing tells us who we should be suspicious of. The Daintree setting is just gorgeous.; fingers crossed that more Australian communities recently damaged by flood and fire will be featured to bring more visitors to those areas. It's a great time to revisit ""The Mole"" but sadly the magic is lacking in this US version."
The Mole,Some of this doesn't add up,"It's hard to know whether some of these people are just ridiculously thick, or if they are the mole. You spend a lot of the time thinking ""if there's only one mole, why did 2 people simultaneously make the dumbest possible choice?"".

It's not scripted, but it's not entirely real either. Netflix keeps pumping out this sort of show, 70% reality, 30% people being told what to say or do, or at the very least being guided in a specific direction.

There's a specific challenge right near the beginning where it's clear the dude knew where to look for an object that really changed the game up. Without him finding it there would have been very little drama, and it just seemed implausible to me he would have found it unless told ""go check over there"" by a producer.

It's great fun, but infuriating at times. At one point there is entirely self destructive behaviour for absolutely no reason, and you do keep asking yourself ""does anyone here actually deserve this money?"". I started to really enjoy it once I started rooting for everyone to fail, which I'm not sure was the shows intention."
The Mole,Surprisingly good!,"I was originally planning to hate watch this series because it was in Netflix top 10 and I was sure it would be like any other tv reality show, boring.

And... the first episode hooked me. I watched like 5 episodes until 4am because I couldn't stop (probably because of the cliffhangers). The concept is simple, each episodes have games played in teams, if they win the game, they had money to the pot. The catch is that a mole was chosen at the beginning of the show, and their goal is to lower has much as possible the pot money without getting caught. That's where sabotaging happens. After each episode, a quiz is taken about the mole, the person with the most wrong answers is eliminated. This goes on until there are 3 players, including the mole. The person that has the rightest answers about the mole wins the pot.

The games are fun, the elimination method was cool and there were little events between the actual big game of each episode so that the show wouldn't be too repetitive. The cast was ok, some were a little boring, some you would just simply hate, others you would root for, but the fact that there is a mole makes this way more interesting. Are they being nice to make others believe there in for the pot or are they genuinely hiding in plain site. Some players are also doing mole behaviors because it's better for them in the long run. But aare they doing it to keep their place in the game, or to lower the pot money.

It's great, I would recommend.

But... I'm actually curious on how the mole works. What are the advantages of sabotaging the mission, are they rewarded with money at the end for the money that they sabotage? If so, what's limiting them to just sabotage has much as possible since they cannot get eliminated from the show? Is it something like they get a part of the money they sabotage, but for each of the last contestant that identifies them, they lose a part?"
The Mole,Entertaining and Addictive,"The Mole is a reality game show where contestants compete for cash prizes. Just one catch, there is a mole trying to sabotage missions. The mole doesn't win money, but the finalists who can identify the mole wins the cash pot.

It's addictive, I watched it in one day... mainly driven by the desire to know who is the mole. The contestant commentaries were well-balanced. The games ranged from great to average, some games were more entertaining to watch. The mole was kept off the radar snd got less commentary time, so perhaps future seasons can remedy that. The cliffhangers of the first few episodes were more effective, I felt. The contestants were a good blend of personalities, and didn't really have an a--hole standout unlike other reality shows... perhaps one or two might drive up the drama. A bit obvious, at times, as to what the show wants you to think. But all in all, well-played."
The Mole,Poor Choices by Producers,"I love nearly all competition reality shows including previous versions of The Mole and I'm usually an easy audience. I also worked for years as a reality tv and game show producer. With that said, this show is disappointing to me for two main reason.

First, it's an unusually unlikable cast. I'm struggling to find anyone to root for. The only person I like is the host.

Second, nearly all commentary throughout the show are just contestants accusing each other of being the mole for any reason. This would be fine if it felt sincere, but it doesn't. It's like the producers decided that constant, empty, accusations without substance would be an easy way to produce the show. It's exceptionally hollow...even by reality show standards.

I REALLY wanted to like this."
The Mole,Best really show EVER,"As a diehard since S1E1 with Anderson, The Mole has been like an addiction. Can't say every season was great (S5), but the reboot is FIRE! Missing Alex in S7 (Netflix S2), but Ari is killing it!!!

I know a lot of people get frustrated since we, as viewers, are at the mercy of editing. However, the hidden clues ARE there, and they always play fair. I miss the older seasons that were more ""interactive"" on ABC.

Even the Celebrity seasons nailed it by never taking it too seriously. If you like a good mystery, and a lot of yelling at the TV, this show is for you!!!

I would also highly recommend the global series as well. In early days, a lot of the games crossed-over, but they are just as fun!!!"
The Mole,So happy this is back!,"I know you're all probably reading my review and wondering about the title! I know during the horrific events that happened on September 11th, 2001 Anderson Cooper was hosting the show the mole! I was so excited about the show back in 2001 but of course understandably when 9/11 happened the show was cut from the air and really I never got to see the ending in fact I don't even know if the show ever ended!?

Anyways I am so stoked to see that the show is back on Netflix I mean I don't even know if it is a continuation from the old production. After we see who the mole is I will dig deeper. Please please continue this show!!!!"

Hellbound,Did I watch the same show?,"I felt compelled to write a review based on the negative comments. I watched this over the course of a day and a half and thought it was very good. Now I understand that not everyone will enjoy the same types of shows but in no sane world is this show a 1-4.

For the reviewers that only made it through 2-3 episodes you missed the jump in the timeline. For the reviewers complaining about a lack of closure after six episodes, well thats because there will be a second season. It's a cliffhanger pretty standard.

I would recommend giving it a go. In my opinion it is better than most of what Hollywood has been putting out for years."
Hellbound,Food for thought,"The story is about broadening your outlook about things that can't be explained scientifically and considered supernatural. Instead of labelling every supernatural event as an act of God or an act of cleansing the sins of humans ,we should consider alternate versions as well , instead of suppressing the voice of people who try to decipher it. Asking questions doesn't make anyone against any religion . The story is about not having blind faith in the name of God ."
Hellbound,Wait until you watched all of the 6 eps,Not sure why with the bad reviews here but it seems mostly on watched the first 2 eps. The story picked up starting from the 3rd eps. To me it is worth watching.
Hellbound,A good offering in this genre if you are ok with cliff hanger endings,Comentario no disponible
Hellbound,Korean is full of surprises,"There is speciality in K-drama is its always have something that suprised and kind of new .the supernatural part in story is small but reaction of humans in it is amazing , its a must watch series,action scenes are missing otherwise its must watch series."

Hellbound,"This is too slow but make it to the end, waiting for season 2 now","I was mostly cold watching it and waiting for it to pick up . I managed to get to the end and i am now very curious to see what happens next. Korean dramas usually have 16 to 20 episodes so I am guessing they did with this one like they did with Kingdom and divide it in two parts. I was expecting more for the first part but I am hoping it will compensate in the second .

For the rest, the show is well made, great acting ( Yoo Ah-in is just chameleonic in everything he does) . The effects are outstanding, the quality of the series is evident and the concept is very original. It just lacks pace and thrill, most of the time but we will see what happens next."
Hellbound,what i think...,"This show is amazing, I think people are hell-bound on the religious aspect of it. This show portrays the morality and philosphical ways of man explored in the concept of fear. I personally enjoyed it, to the extent it got me questioning life. The show uses religion as a factor which could be subtitiuted with anything else, but because there are people out there who still have faith of high begin it has a impact on them. The show develops quite late but express a need of change within society."

Hellbound,The Squid Game Effect,"Here we go....with the popularity of Squid Game we now have many new trendy viewers watching Korean media. These low reviews saying it's ""boring"" after only watching 2 episodes is typical of the average viewer in 2021. If it doesn't have grown men flying around in spandex, or some controversial woke topic at it's heart people simply are not interested."
Hellbound,What happened!,"Season 1 Excellent, Season 2 Trash compared to Season 1.

The whole theme of the show changed and it looked like the wow factor from Season 1 got stuck there.

The characters had no bond created with the audience and it came across like a thrown together script. I'm so disappointed as I waited for Season 2 to complete the questions of Season 1 yet it was so mismatched it looked like a completely different show.

I don't understand the point/direction this show took. Neither do I understand what message the show was trying to convey! I kept watching hoping for it to get better and I could only manage to get up-to episode 3 then I was done as I couldn't watch anymore as it was obvious the script was not upto pare."
Hellbound,Slow start but oh my god!,"Firstly, people who have posted there reviews without watching the whole of first season please...just...

Sit through the first episode and you will end up binge watching till the end. The first two episodes had there moments but they were necessary to set the universe and timeline in order for the people to understand whats about to happen.

Overall the acting of all of the people was great and so many questions were left unanswered (in a good way) that i can't actually wait for the next season."
Hellbound,Great concept with too much drama.,"I like slow burners for psycological thrillers, but a sci-fi fantasy like this needs better pace. It is still worth the watch though. The acting was good, and Korean films and shows in gemeral have really been picking up the last couple of years."
Hellbound,Disappointing and Incoherent Storyline & Where is the Army?,Comentario no disponible
Hellbound,HELBOUND 's review,"I personally watched the English dub version .

Dub quality is decent Acting is good The main thing about this series which makes it likable is its open to INTERPRETATIONS .

It has many major plot holes which feel kind of irritating while watching .

People interested around the RELIGION / atheism will enjoy it .

Series leaves us on a cliffhanger ."
Hellbound,Pretty Good but hard to get in first few couple of episodes,"I watched this over a few weekends. I was lost as to what was going on until the final 2 episodes. If you stopped after a couple of episode you will not the final understanding of what is really happing to these people being ""demonstrated"". Even at the end of the series you still wonder what's really happening. I like the series because it is really making me think about religion, doctrine and how it is used and how it can be used to control people."
Hellbound,A gripping series,"I started just thinking of watching one episode and perhaps leave the rest for a later time. Instead, I ended up binge watching the whole series. The story line, suspenses and gore are gripping and will leave you numb at times. Nevertheless, it's a brilliant series and can't wait for S2."
Hellbound,"actually turned out different than I thought, which was a good thing..","It's a decent show, I liked it. It was pretty darn brutal though, which got tiring (for me) at times, never boring though. Then, by the end, what I thought would, or might, happen, didn't, and I'm really looking forward to season 2 now. It's a bit cheesy in the very beginning but that passes, and you can really tell that they put a lot of money into the effects.

It's definitely not for everyone but it does have a good payoff for those that stick with the 6 episodes."
Hellbound,Overwhelming technical shortcomings with ingenuity and insight,"When I saw the CG monsters in the trailer, I thought, ""Director Yeon has come up with something strange again"" and I didn't have much expectations for this show. Fortunately, the focus of this show was not on the supernatural phenomenon itself, but on the human reaction to it, and the overwhelming insight and originality of the work offsets other technical shortcomings.

While ""Squid Game"" by Hwang Dong-hyuk or ""Train to Busan""(2016) by Yeon himself were entertainers for many people, this show seems to be a work for the audience who put more weight on the subject matter of the work. In terms of originality, it can be compared to ""The Wailing""(2016) by Na Hong-jin, and the ending of the last eposode is reminiscent of ""Children of Men""(2006) by Alfonso Cuarón.

As a Korean director, Yeon Sang-ho is not yet at the level of masters like Park Chan-wook and Bong Joon-ho. But he has proven within the mainstream that he is an original storyteller that will continue to be noticed."
Hellbound,Chill out Korea,Comentario no disponible
Hellbound,Season 2 just killed this show,"The first season was really enjoyable-maybe nothing groundbreaking, but still very intriguing. I was eagerly awaiting the second season.

Unfortunately, it fell short of every possible expectation. I haven't watched a show this dull in a long time. Endless, meaningless dialogues drag on, feeling clichéd and predictable in every episode. The characters act irrationally, without logic, and their actions often seem forced. The storyline that once held so much potential now feels scattered and repetitive, and any suspense or tension from the first season is completely lost. I'm not very familiar with Korean TV tropes, so I'm unsure if these are common; either way, it's hard to find redeeming qualities here."
Hellbound,It Is More Philosophic Than You Guys Might Have Ever Imagined!,"""Upholding righteousness and justice in fear of damnation. Is that truly righteous and just?""

Right off the bat, I must clear up some obvious misunderstandings! This isn't one of those typical Fantasy/Sci-fi/Supernatural shows that deal with Monsters or otherworldly creatures; as opposed to what Netflix might have suggested through their various promotional content on numerous social media platforms lately.

This show goes way deeper in scrutinizing not one but many societal demeanours and it is indeed way more philosophic than you guys might have ever imagined!

On top of having a powerful statement heeding Religious beliefs, faith, cults etc; Hellbound seemingly speaks against the core idea of Extremism, Radicalism too. The show with much profundity contemplates and argues the very foundation of this dangerous, self-destructive stuff, that can only give rise to chaos and social unrest in society.

However, the exact representation here isn't as simple as it may sound. Believe it or not, It has got multifaceted layers of complicated matters and countless subtexts which can only be found out only if you pay good enough attention.

Speaking of attention, the terrific writing willingly takes on the mantle and manages to withhold the all-important momentum and that too in a quite sophisticated manner! On the other side, you will get to know an array of versatile characters and each one of them's individualistic narratives that feel so relatable on so many levels!

Let us all just appreciate the whole ensemble, the entire cast; who had shown tremendous commitment and sincerity to each of their respective roles! And kudos to the technical team (Especially, the guys who were in charge of the Background Score); for giving it justice from a technological stance as well.

My main criticisms lie in its core storyline, which at times, reveals glaring loopholes and is yet to provide transparency in regards to a few of the questions that sprung to my mind. Even though, it was expected that the story would take more than one season to come to a feasible conclusion; got to admit, I was expecting to get at least some kind of closure."
Hellbound,Korean series are having a big problem: they take too long between seasons.,"Something bad is happening with Korean series, it happened to ""Sweet Home"" and it will surely happen to ""Squid Game""...many years pass between seasons. The same thing happens to ""Hellbound"" which has an incredible, compelling, striking and dark first season and a second one, which although it is in that line, changes the focus quite a bit and we go from the mystery of the monsters and why they send people to hell to a more apocalyptic plot focused on humans. But all this, 3 years later, makes it lose interest and surely numbers.

I think that the series is correct, the script seems consistent to me and the performances as well. I especially highlight Min and the detective from the first season in the moments that he appears.

In season 2 the mystery is less than in the previous one but it takes it to a more political side. We are shown how the government intercedes between a religious organization and a group of religious fanatics in order to benefit and generate an order that no longer exists. On the other hand, we are shown the appearance of the ""resurrected"" but in two different ways: Park Jung-ja, who learned from her stay in hell and has a happy ending, unlike Jung Jin-su who did not and his actions lead to becoming another envoy.

The effects are better than in the first season, but as I say, it lacks the mystery that characterized the previous one.

Perhaps its biggest problem is the pace, at times slow, but not boring.

We will see if there is or not a third season, it would seem the most correct, but that does not mean that so much time passes..."
Hellbound,Very Bleak & Depressing Series,"Finished watching all 6 episodes in one night. It reminds me a lot of ""Death Note"" if you've ever watched that series but the idea of divine punishment for sinners and how it's received by the world is a lot different in this series or course. There isn't any explanation for the phenomena the people are experiencing...only that they must have done something to deserve their fates. The series drags you through 6 episodes (so far) that get more bleak and depressing as they carry on and then the series ends on a wtf moment. Hellbound is just not a satisfying experience to watch. There really are no redeeming characters and everyone seems to make deliberate bad decisions for the sake of plot progression.

On a side note... Korean movies are also funny sometimes because only the police have guns so a majority of the ""violence"" involves groups of people or a person hitting someone with a bat or club. There is a lot of that in this movie and after a while those scenes get tiring to watch because it's almost like the people they're beating are made of rubber or something. After getting beaten nearly fatally by pipes and bats they just get up and start running like nothing happened. Not just in this series but in just about every Korean movie or series. It's kind of comedic after a while."
Hellbound,Slow at times but certainly interesting. I was gripped after a fairly slow couple of episodes,"After a fairly slow start I started to really enjoy it and as TV series go it's one of the better ones.

It's a very interesting series and had they pitched the idea of the series to me I couldn't have seen how it would work... and yet work it does!

The only troubling part for me was the end of the series... as these South Korean films/series do... they tend to cross the line for me and in this instance it was with the baby.

7 out of 10. Recommended."

The Match,Good flick,"This film is, in my opinion, quite solid. It's not perfect, but the story flows well and the message is most important. The human spirit cannot be defeated.

And for all the reviewers who expected star power and high-octane action movie, look elsewhere. This is, after all, drama-indie flick.

The Match,"Sub, Please!","Poor retelling of a great story about courage and resilience. Based on real events, I could let it slide if it was a solid drama that was lacking a bit in the sports department or an excellent sport movie with dramatic elements sort of bolted on around it. Unfortunately, The Match fails in both areas.

Being indie or low-budget doesn't have to mean low quality. It's not even an attention to detail issue. It's just bad. The script is ridiculous, acting was stiff, and direction felt like they had a two-take limit and just took what they got. The two biggest-name actors (Nero and Assante) are in the movie for less than five minutes combined. ""The match"" itself, which is supposed to be the highlight of such a film, is laughable from a technical perspective. It feels thrown together, shot, and edited in the same afternoon. The choreography is unskilled, uninspired, and amateurish, even though they cast pro footballers.

The rules and equipment are completely wrong for the era. Now, if they had missed by a few years or even a decade, OK fine, whatever, let's not nitpick... but they missed by 70+ years in some cases! It's no exaggeration to say it would be more accurate if characters had cell phones in WWII. That's how far off they missed. Yes, this is a low budget, indie film. Pretty sure they could afford Google and could spare 5 minutes.

2/10 .. Referee, sub please!?

Such a great story deserves to be told in a way that isn't so painful to watch. For example, a dramatized version is told very well in Victory (1981), starring Pele, Sylvester Stallone, Max von Sydow, and Sir Michael Caine (not a lot of people know that). I can't stress enough that you need to go watch that movie instead, especially if you've never seen it before."
The Match,A poor version of a great story,"The plot is dull, the football action meek and amateurish. Three stars fully justified by cameos from Viduka, Kova & Lovren. More of a freestyle, pseudo-docu reconstruction that looks cheap and.fails to generate any emotional attachment. Really poor."
The Match,Touching and captivating,"The story is touching and captivating. It shows hope in the darkest moments, and shows how human spirits can transcend into selflessness for the greater good."
The Match,Victory 1981,Really? We have already seen this with great cast and script and story and acring and direction. I dont know what are all trying to do with remaking (nd failing)not so old classic films.
The Match,A 'soccer' for a soccer player,"Despite the previous reviews I loved this movie. You get hold by the granddad who is telling its lifestory to his grandchild... a beautifull life lesson to be passed foreword. It reminds you of the fact that the only thing in life what is important is life itselfs.

So no spoiler alerts here. But please see this movie and see this Hungarian man standing his grounds... by God almighty, this is what humanity should be...

Be fair, be right, be justice

Help eachother when in need and respect one another, if you respect human life you respect progress..

The Match,I liked it a lot more than I expected to,"I did not begin to watch this movie with high expectations but I have to say it is very respectable. I do not understand some of the ""criticisms"", if you can even call them that. Sure, the actors in the film aren't famous but that's because it's an indie film, not a Hollywood production. I'd say the actors put in performances decent enough that they don't detract from the film. In terms of the production, perhaps someone would have managed to hide the small budget even better, but I didn't mind how the film was presented. In few insignificant places I did think some directional choices were a bit weird but not nearly enough to make me dislike the film. Because the most important thing works- and that is the story. I wouldn't say it's not comparable to anything else done before but it is a classic that works and is enjoyable. I would happily watch this movie many more times."
The Match,I don't have any words,"I am never speechless. But I really don't have the words. There aren't any You have to watch for yourself, and the actors, still no words.

Thank you for sharing this with the world."
The Match,Another side of the typical war story line,I absolutely loved this move. As I have seen many pre war movies. I already had an assumption in my mind about this movie. But it was different. Sensitive and daring at the same time. Ppl will give their last if they believe in what's it's right. You can't deny anyone talent.
The Match,Wonderfull,"This is not a real review, it should be understood more as a collection of impressions on the film.

A low-budget film that tells the story of a football match between Nazis and prisoners in a concentration camp, that said, the film seems to be a very sad half-assed film and instead it turns out to be a compelling and emotionally charged thing that fully captures you from the beginning to the end, mixing moments heavy and trying to beautiful scenes of lightness and lightheartedness so as to give a complete film which, even if it tells a tragic and terrible story, does not fall into total despair because it wants to teach us something and it does so masterfully."

The Irregular at Magic High School,Good? Bad? I hope this review will help you decide!,"The first 3 episodes seem muddled and confusing and may discourage some viewers. Western viewers will find the passionate love between the starring brother and sister rather disturbing. (As a side note, the anime series does not explain that the brother and sister are genetically engineered to be bonded and are not normal siblings.)

Once the series begins its story arcs, we have engaging stories, complex battles and technical strategizing. The plots involve magical-science theory, espionage, gangsters, and foreign invasions. The fighting becomes more intense and eventually rather gory. Depending on the magic used, some bodies simply vanish, while others may explode in a shower of blood and body parts.

I hope this gives you the info you need to decide whether to watch this or not. I expect some will love it and others will hate it!"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"good show, left me wanting more...","High school students with magical abilities are a dime a dozen in anime these days, but this show made you care about the characters, and their magic was unique and interesting.

Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba are new students at 'First High School', a school of top level magicians, set a few hundred years in the future. Miyuki is a 'Bloom', a top level magician (in the best magician school), while her older brother, Tatsuya, is a 'weed', a lower class of magician. Initially, Tatsuya, and most other 'weeds' are ostracised due to their limited ability to wield magic. However, it quickly becomes apparent that Tatsuya's magic wielding ability is anything but limited...

I really liked this show, but think it might be best to view multiple episodes at a time, as I watched it each week and seemed to forget what happened last week and was surprised by each episode. The characters all have distinct personalities and looks, but I did get confused occasionally, especially towards the end. Plus, the show seemed accessible to all ages, yet the last few episodes were very violent and maybe too much for young kids. Anyway, it's pretty cool...check it out"
The Irregular at Magic High School,Interesting story & action with creative sci-fi type magic.,"The Irregular at Magic High School is an interesting display of very creative high tech magic, which is to say, magic which is brought into the science fiction realm and treated as if it had rules and formulae and can be modified by skilled technicians, which they call ""magic engineers."" A lot of the series time is spent delving into the mechanics of augmenting the magic, but then it is Magic High School, and the rest of the time is spent displaying the magic at work. The first part of the series dwells on integrating the irregular, Tatsuya, who is the major character, into the high school. He is a pretty cool character in every sense of the word: powerful, unflappable, dependable. He and his beautiful younger sister, Miyuki, who is also a powerful magician, have a very close relationship, which doesn't quite ever descend into inappropriateness, but the sister does always show her powerful feelings for her brother. Could it work into something more, possibly, but it never happens in the series, and we're left with two siblings who care deeply for each other. The second half of the series is spent with the good guy magicians fighting off bad guy other people, although we're never quite sure why the bad guy people are that committed to wiping out the magicians - probably just because they're magicians! The leads to lots of action, fighting, & battle scenes that are entertaining and fairly well done. It never gets heavy and one is left with an interesting show that moves along nicely with lots of action and creative sci-fi concepts, which is unusual for a story with magic in it. Definitely worth watching."
The Irregular at Magic High School,Awesome!!,I loved this anime very much..one of my most favourite animes..i liked the story and MC very much..so cool and overpowered..waiting for the next seasons..hope this anime will continue..
The Irregular at Magic High School,It's not bad,This anime quite not bad actually. Though on the first season I wanted to stop watching. But somehow I ended season 1 and started season2. Season 2 is quite great compared to season 1 i must say. At the first I wanted to give it 5 or 6 * but because of second season I gave it 7*. Although it still didn't meet my expectations. It's not a must watch anime but if you have time you should give it a shot.
The Irregular at Magic High School,Excellent Cross Genre Anime,"When I searched for new anime to watch, the lead character of this show popped up many times as not only a great hidden power character but one that was just cool. And he is. His confidence or lack of emotional display rather, may give the impression he is overpowered but he is not though it is implied he could potentially reach that plateau, but so could dozens of others with the same kind of great powers he has. This anime shines mainly because it is anything but an atypical nor overly clichéd anime yet it brilliantly skirts the surface of many anime icons and popular genres without falling into those tired clichés that so often fill each of those genres. It does some of them in a rather skillful reverse gimmick like the harem theme. He is so socially awkward and unskilled such a thing does not even cross his mind but he is so smart and good at magical programming that he attracts girls' interests and guys as friends. Or the magic power theme, he has great and diverse power but he is not allowed to show it even if he wanted to which he doesn't since he isn't a showboat. His sister is essentially the princess of her class/grade but she is so dependent upon her brother she lacks confidence to take advantage of that position. He is a top notch martial artist as well but he doesn't flaunt it like in many other martial art focused anime. Characters are a bit more realistic who all have some flaws but not something so detrimental or unrealistic that could spoil the appeal of the anime or the main characters. You can see many themes portrayed in one way or another in the series like: High school; magic; mecha; espionage; martial arts; gunfights; sword play; sports; and more. The major drawback is the uneasy brocon aspect of Miyuki, which she always denies. It could do with a more in depth back story explanation that is only hinted at in the opening sequence. It does seem unfinished because it needs another 2 or 3 seasons. At the end we are left wondering how the others would react to all this new information and never quite get that satisfied probably because the studio must have planned more seasons and did not prepare an ending to slip in if no additional seasons were to be forthcoming. It is however one of the best animes, despite a few flaws, I have ever seen in part because it isn't the same as most and has few if any tired repetitive clichés. It is one of the few animes, I can also watch over and over or even more than once without getting overly bored or tired of it."
The Irregular at Magic High School,Too Technical and Cringeworthy,"I felt this anime could've had a lot more going for it. It has a good basis for a story but it comes off as cold and confusing. The hero isn't relatable to the viewer at all but somehow we are meant to pity him for not being able to cast practical magic like his sister. The interactions between the students are extremely cringe worthy and most of what they have to say embarrasses the hell out of them. Half of the episodes get in depth at all the mechanics of spell casting which might entertain some viewers but left me bored and surfing the web while waiting for a more interesting part of the episode to arrive.

I would only recommend this anime to people who are into the technical aspect of science fiction, otherwise I'd stay clear of this one."
The Irregular at Magic High School,It's amazing!,"This is one of the greatest animes of all time, on par with Monogatari and No Game No Life. It has a really good tory is really touching and amazing! It's so technical and mind blowing, yet it also has time to develop some really great and memorable characters. By mixing magic and sci-fi, this series is so unique and mind blowing, it leaves you wishing you went to a magic high school! The Irregular at Magic High School is really worth your time!

Edit: Season 2 is amazing!"
The Irregular at Magic High School,"If you like S1, you may dislike S2, and vice versa","Personally, I'd give Season One 8 * and Season Two 3 * After reading some reviews, it seems like anime watchers today fall into 2 different camps: people that enjoy novels, and people that enjoy mindless action flicks. I fall into the first category. I loved season 1, for it gave the world and characters depth, while season 2 opted to skip details and give you plenty of scenery.

Season 1: This series is filled with what someone else has described as ""technobabble"". In a magical society, care has been taken to explain the science behind the mystery, so that things don't just ""magically"" happen. For a work where everything is magic, the scientific logic is well conceived. Since a lot of what happens onscreen is related to how magic actually works in this world, these explanations are necessary, and I find it quite enjoyable.

The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, who is the polar opposite of Naruto. Ironically, people who dislike Naruto probably also dislike Tatsuya, but I liked them both. The general audience seem to conceive him as ""perfect"", however, that he certainly is not. The anime hints at this, but you'd have to look up the novel it's based off of to actually find out that he has a major personality problem. Tatsuya ends up resolving a lot of major crisis that occur around the school, a lot of which actually happen because of him. In fact, because of who he is, Tatsuya invites trouble. Through the story, his capability does not change, but as the events become bigger and bigger, in the end you find out just powerful he really is. Again, ironically, this one-man-army concept is also something action flicks enthusiasts have no problem with when it's in an action flick. While Tatsuya is certainly a powerhouse. His problems are personal and political in nature, and cannot be solved with just that. However, at the end of season 1, all we had was a brief journey, and Tatsuya's problems were not really revealed or resolved.

Season 2: This series was designed to cater to the action flick crowd. Almost nothing is explained and scenes consist of Tatsuya shooting his CAD at things just to shoot at them. Most of the show revolves around giving you action scenes, or giving you low level fan service. Almost every episode manages to squeeze in fan service in some shape or form.

In its effort to provide gratification, very little background is given to the story. They're in such a rush that they do not bother to set the mood, and you're thrust from scene to scene with little or no explanation. A lot of the times, they even offhandly give you a 1 or 2 liner about what happened offscreen to get to the current point in time. Details are just non-existent, so that the audience can try to figure it out themselves, or don't, since we're only actually interested in people trying to kill each other. I can only hope that this was done in an attempt to squeeze 20 episodes of content into 13, but based on reception, maybe this was intentional.

Many new characters are thrown into this season, none of which are given any introduction. There's plenty of character development, all of which was done off screen, so you don't actually see any. Now that I think about it, this is just like those flashback episodes you get in the middle of long shows telling you what happened through 50 episodes in the timespan of 2."
The Irregular at Magic High School,One of the Worst and Boring Anime with High School Setting and Boring MC,"First of all, the writer of this anime need help. What's with the weird brother-sister romance! This is the worst thing of this anime. But there are more. The MC is totally boring and uninteresting. He never smiles, never get afraid, he is like a robot. And he can beat up anyone. I mean we love OP MC. But there are settings for that. I know looks don't matter much. But this MC, he looks boring. Then there are Fake Magic ! The writer confused advanced technology with magic and made this hybrid sh**t. He thought it might be cool. Well, it's not cool, it's boring and nonsense. Isekai, Adventure Anime Fans beware, this Sh**t of anime does not have any Adventure in it. It is mostly unnecessary boring talking and some boring fight scene, the weird brother-sister romance shi**t. All within the school. There is no actual story here, that you can follow. Just by looking at the anime name, I thought there is a MC who is different and interesting, who study in a Magic High School in order to fulfill his mission or dream. No such thing exists in this anime.

I guess, the Irregular is the brother-sister romance.

God! I got bored real fast with just watching the first five episode. I managed to survive watching all the episode by fast forwarding. Don't waste your time with this shi*t Trash of a anime."
The Irregular at Magic High School,One of the great anime,"The main character is very powerful, because of that their is no space for other magics. The past of the MC is not yet mentioned till second season. Tatsuya and miyuki are brother and sister. Both loves each other. The story is great. Seems like little bit underrated."

The Irregular at Magic High School,It's for mature fan,"When i start this anime i don't expect much from it but when i crossed few episode i feel that's something i should watch. With time i fell addicted for this anime. I couldn't stop myself from watch it. You will feel thrilled when you overcome 10 episode. This anime so many different plot. You will feel excited slowly and can't resist yourself from watch it. I have exam after some days but i couldn't stop myself from watch. I completed 4 season and 2 movies within 3 days. Now,Shiva Tatsuya is one of my favourite character. He is very cool and calm. His sister Miyuki is so obsessed with him and i like this way. I root for them. I think you wil enjoy it."
The Irregular at Magic High School,"no... I was whrigt from the start, this is bad as hell","I saw one season and 5 episodes. I am not gonna tire you by mentioning what you can find in the official review. The Good: Lovely animations. Nice idea for story (magic and tech) The OK: It somehow manages to survive the harem tag, since there are some males B protagonists, but just barely since, nearly every girl is in owe by our awkward and (wanna be) socially distanced Main Character. There are some well written characters too. Tries to give personality to them all also. The flow of the story I haven't decided if I consider it bad or ok, it is kind of giving the impression that there is order in the chaos, but I can't put my finger on it, so I leave it here. The Bad: I will start with simple bad things... Brother & Sister(are they?) romance and an awkward as hell one at that. So many characters that you lose track after 7 or 10 episodes. Over powered M.C. just for the heck of it I asume, since I haven't after all those episodes come to understand why. AND my two biggest complaints... I saw over 30 episodes The story is a damn mess since sidestories interact with each other and then get out of the picture only to get back when the writer needs them. The M. C. alone has over 4 different occupations (student, bodyguard, magic mechanic, soldier, relations with high profile clan, ninja, you name it) and is not like the other characters are far back on that subject. We are talking about 15-16 year old people here may I remind you. After over 30 Episodes I know NOTHING! I don't know how he became so strong, how he became so ""weak"", how he has the connections that he has, what are his connections, I have only a very abstract idea of how the magic that the whole show stand upon works, making it feel like the whole magic power is just broken and new spells get drown out the hero's hat every time is needed. The show tries to sell it as Sci Fi but no, is just magic, and a soft type (with little understanding) to say the least. Conclusion: I started and saw 5 episodes back in the day and didn't like (mostly because of the brother-sister relationship) I considered it a joke. Now that it started again I decided to give it a real chance since it would pop up in every recommendation... I feel I wasted nearly 10 hours of my life. I leave it with the only second thought that if it has a manga it might solve many of the story's issues. That's all from me."

Yeah I understand there is love between brother and sister but it takes to some another level. They are just chattering everything from episode one like bro you aren't teaching us magic. It doesn't exist so dont be so real with ur fantasy. I think writer of this thought too much about magic. Anyway its nothing in 6 episodes half of the time goes where they teach us about magic and half of the time goes to brother sister love ( really cringe, there are other ways to show love between siblings)"

Between,"Watchable, entertaining and unbelievable (but who cares)","Yes, it is unbelievable, parts of it could be better, but nonetheless, it retains interest throughout. Watchable drama that does not pretend to be anything other than entertainment. Also, so fitting for the times. An entertaining way of passing the time in isolation caused by the COV-19 virus."
Between,Not as bad as it's being made out.,"I think the reviews on this are pretty harsh. While it's not going to win any awards, the first episode wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be based on what I read here. It kind of is what it is, an Under the Dome copy with a different scenario. Some of the acting could be better,some of the script could be better but I'm not going to judge it badly based on the first episode. Sometimes these series take a few episodes to bed in properly. I'll come back and do another review a few episodes in which I guess means I intend to keep watching! I didn't really think much of Jericho after watching the first episode but ended up hooked so I guess I'll wait and see."
Between,"It's watchable, but the storyline is dull","I'm only three episodes into the first season. Aside from nickelodeon's Jeanette McCurdy (who really hasn't gotten much time to shine), the acting is horrendous and the dialogue is weak. This isn't a show to binge quickly but if you're looking for something to keep you distracted every now and again, I would suggest you watch an episode or two. There's not really any depth to these characters and the scenes of guns being drawn get tiresome after awhile. I'm not emotionally drawn to what happens to the characters, but at the very least I'm curious as to the cause of the illness."
Between,Not as bad as some people make it to be ...,"I don't know why people have this movie.

It is a combination of ""Behind The Dome"" and ""Lord of the Flies"". It is not going to win any awards but in a strange way, it is actually entertaining. Maybe it is so because the idea, why a combination of others, is new. In a way, it feels realistic, of how children would actually act in such a situation.

There are many logical plot holes (even from the basic premise, a bio-weapon or such that kills anyone who is over 22, including 22) but some of the actors have some charm about them - in a way that it looks so amateurish that it looks realistic.

It is good having it in the background on Netflix, while doing something else. I've seen many police procedurals rated 7 - 8 here on IMDb.com that bore me to death. This at least, is not amazing but it is relatively interesting."
Between,Yawnful - Please make it stop!,"First, let me start with the positive; There is some production and budget here. I watched the first episode a while ago and my only positive thought was ""how is the writing so bad but there was money for the rest?""

The dialogue is bland and just silly, first brought to my attention when someone kept yelling ""grandfather, grandfather..."" over and over. Nobody does that and from there the rest was pretty obvious.

The characters try to be believable and relate-able but they seem to just pulled from someone's experience of other shows and not real life. Nerdy kid, troubled sister, the admirable jock, the bad kids, the rich kid...

The characters seem to make decisions that are so, so , so bad that you forget how stupid the overall premise of the show is and stop believing the whole experience.

Worse yet is that this show is really just ""the dome"". A ""mysterious virus"" that causes sudden tongue bleeding and bad acting seconds before death causes a town to become isolated and quarantined. The only difference between this show and the dome is that the characters ages are restricted, that and the role of the dome is being played by the military.

What makes this show even worse is that there seems to be a series of stupid shows out now that revolve around small towns and something mysterious happening; Wayward pines, salem, bates motel, sleepy hollow, the dome, haven and more. If you restrict the location and characters in a show you have to elevate the sub-plots to ridiculously unbelievable levels. These shows are becoming predictable and trying to out-stupid each other it seems while adding slight variances."
Between,A solid 7,"I give this show a solid 7. Yes, some of the dialogue/acting seems a bit wooden at first but, as the season progresses, the actors and their characters grow. The apparent ""holes"" in the story are there to create suspense. As the characters grow and learn more about themselves, the virus, and their places in the ""new"" Pretty Lake, so do we the viewers. For such a young cast, I think they did an outstanding job! I only wish Krystal Hope Nausbaum had been given a bigger role. She is totally awesome as Amanda! Oh, and I watched every episode of the first season before coming to any conclusions, rather than after 1 episode like most of my fellow reviewers."
Between,It takes a frightening science fiction premise and then generally fails to execute anything terribly scary or thrilling.,"The first episode of Netflix' new ""Between"" web series (2015) reminds me a hell of a lot of ""Jericho"" (2006). It takes a frightening science fiction premise and then generally fails to execute anything terribly scary or thrilling. ""Jericho"" told the story of a small town surviving a mysterious nuclear holocaust — it looked to be a serialized ""The Day After"" (1983), but ultimately became a chipper, too-safe family drama that almost seemed to channel ""The Waltons"" (1971).

The premiere of ""Between"" introduces us to the small town of Pretty Lake, where a mysterious illness is killing anyone over the age of 22  which is kind of convenient for the young-adult target audience that this show is going for. The show sounded like an update of ""The Andromeda Strain"" film adaptation in 1971. But after we see the town quarantined, it seems to borrow a page or two from the television treatment of Stephen King's ""Under The Dome"" (2013). (I disliked that book, and have heard some pretty mixed things about the TV show.)

""Between"" has a few things going for it, like well-scripted characters and capable young actors. But it has problems with pacing and tension. There's a nice flourish here and there, including the shot you see below. But for a TV show about a potentially world-ending plague, it fails to scare. I'd give this first episode a 6 out of 10.

What's the deal with naming the town ""Pretty Lake,"" anyway? Is it intentionally generic for thematic reasons, or just lazy screen writing? Are neighboring towns ""Big Mountain"" and ""Long River?"""
Between,Great series!,Wish they had made season 3! I thoroughly enjoyed this series from start to finish. Every episode had drama and action. Storyline was interesting and not predictable like I thought it would be. This is an underrated gem!
Between,Between... what?,"This series was very much like ""Under the Dome"" (which aired earlier, and was considerably more stupid. Alien eggs and Butterflies...).

The most confusing thing is the name. What does ""Between"" have to do with anything?

Other than that, the acting was decent, directing okay, script a bit cliche but held all the way through. The characters were interesting and diverse.

The biggest problem was ""nothing new here"". Re-done, re-hashed, and some of it unbelievable.

There were numerous logic flaws in the writing. Why didn't the government regularly airlift supplies into the town? Exactly when do gas masks and hazmats work and not work? (Randomly, it seems.) But most of all, the basic premise of people dying off the VERY DAY they turn 22? Sorry Hollywood, but there is nothing biological that magically changes the very day one turns 22 years old. Age is counted from the day of birth... which could be right on time, premature or late. Further, people have different biological clocks. Some live fewer years, some live to a ripe old age. There was no logical explanation of age 22 being the trigger. There are other biological markers that might have made more sense for triggering the virus. Or simply make it a random death factor like real viruses: some people it kills, some it doesn't... but it has about a 50% morbidity rate. The 22 years old thing was illogical. Someone should have caught that right off. (And for the record, that female prison guard wasn't under 22. Give us a break.)

So the consistency was off, and of course the drama over-played. But it wasn't totally unbelievable, as we well know what people can become when authority is totally removed. That part was the most believable of all. We saw here a regular battle between good, neutral, bad and evil. Pretty fed up though, with yet another ""government conspiracy"" plot. Not that I don't think there aren't government conspiracies... but come up with something new people.

So 6 stars for being an entertaining watch, which is all I hoped for. I was disappointed there wasn't a third season, but maybe the caliber of this series didn't warrant a third season. By the time it ended the government conspiracy bit had been overplayed and overcooked. I don't see where they could have gone much beyond this."
Between,"A virus is killing people over 21, there's just one problem...","All the survivors are played by actors that look 25-28.

A mysterious illness is striking the people of Pretty Lake. I can't tell you what country the idyllic small town of Pretty Lake is in cause the show never tells us.

'Between' is basically a festival of cinematic clichés: there's a pregnant teen, we aren't old who the father is, some bad clues can give us a good guess, there's a rich family that easily earns our hate, there's a poor family that is easy to like, there's a hacker--or at least cinema's idea of a hack--complete with fancy graphics on his computer that no one has ever seen, there's the overused motif of an aggressive military cordon--but they let the dude smuggling drugs and weapons pass through the checkpoint. ""Here, you'll need these,"" an ambiguous military person says as he hands the drug smuggler his guns back and releases him into the quarantine zone.

And yet, the above things are believable. What is not believable is a disease that presents no symptoms and then *BANG* a person spits up some blood and keels over in five seconds.

Netflix will be releasing one episode a week... and I cannot wait to not watch them."
Between,Why wasn't this brought back???,This show was so good when it was on! It was like the Walking Dead done right! They had a good story with building a society but also trying to figure out the mystery behind the disease. Really wish Netflix would bring this series back.
Between,Fools one and all,"Everytime you think, ""this character is the one that I will enjoy"". Try again. All characters are losers, who will always do the wrong thing when the chips are down. I really wanted to enjoy this show. And there is enough to make you wonder what will happen. If you are smart you just won't start watching. You will be sad if you do. Frances the little black girl on the farm is probably the only character I would want as a friend from this town."
Between,Virus should have just got them all,"The jam packed cast of high school cliches was pretty bad, but I'm the type to try and give things a chance, and honestly a couple of early portrayals and characters had me wanting to give the show a chance.

But (extremely mild spoilers) the young ""genius"" trope bound for MIT proceeds to hack extremely secure government servers in a matter of seconds and a dozen keystrokes. He then looks at roughly 15 data points in a collection of literally thousands of numbers in an irregular distribution and gleans the pattern miraculously - handing us, the viewer, the hook to the show. Turns out only old people are dying, yay!

He then proceeds to tell exactly no one, tries to escape, and is seemingly shot dead.

Don't worry though, less than 15 minutes further into this train wreck the government itself will reveal the big secret to the entire (remaining) town, making the entire series of scenes utterly pointless!

I didn't make it past the government video tape, but I have zero doubt our hacker friend survived his bullet too.

The farm boy knows how to save a birthing that's going badly, the drug dealer magically has the SWAT dudes who shoot on sight let his drugs through, and don't worry - early signs tell us that the elitist 1%er is going to be the trouble maker that interferes with our more likeable teenagers from seamlessly setting up a functioning society.

In my head cannon, the virus finishes off the rest of the town and the series ended by the end of episode 2, because I'm not wasting more of my time to find out otherwise. It's better this way."
Between,Overall something you should totally watch if you're into the thrill,"I looked at the reviews and people are pretty harsh. The show isn't the best but it's far from the worst I watched season 1 and 2(yeah for the people that said it wouldn't make it there looks like it did)and they were pretty good of course there was things you would be like ""wtf"" to and asked ""why didn't you do this instead of that"" but it kept me interested. For the people saying why didn't they tell why the virus is happening I mean that is the whole point of the show why would they just up and tell you it doesn't make sense. I never saw the shows that were mentioned to be like it like Jericho and Under the dome but reading the things of saying how similar they were didn't surprise me because nowadays they love making remakes. I wouldn't say that the acting was terrible but it wasn't good. For instance Adam really killed me with how bland he was I was like Where's this dudes emotion and most of these kids are from degrassi which is also funny . But you should really stay tune for what happens at the end of season 2 it's really crazy but at the same time still confusing."

Between,Gets better in Season 2,Comentario no disponible
Between,Such high hopes,"Honestly, this is a great concept; however, the acting is meh on a good day. The details of story are extremely predictable, but it's still somewhat entertaining to watch. Nothing new under the sun, am I right?

I'm to the point now where I've lowered my expectations, and am just waiting to see how bad it gets. First time I've been disappointed by a Netflix title.

But I'll keep watching. Gotta give it at least a season, right? While other shows like Orange is The New Black and House of Cards show their hand all in one fell swoop, I can appreciate that Netlix is releasing this season one episode at a time.

Because, at least then, I can forget just how abysmal the last episode was.

Good day, and happy viewing."
Between,The show really does ramp up in Season 2.,"This T.V. show started off slow in season 1. Not offering much depth to the viewer. The acting looked as if it was for a college film class, but everything changed in season 2. This show has to be one of the best Netflix Originals of 2016, and that is saying something with shows like House of Cards and Marco Polo being in the same class.

Most viewers, after watching season 1, will not return to watch the second installment. That will be a loss to them. ""Between"" is shaping up to become a must watch on your binge watching list. I believe that a year or two from now people will hear of what a great show this is truly is.

I say we let Season 3 roll around, and see more development in the story line, because if it is anything like season 2... we will all be in for a treat!"
Between,Not bad - worth binge watching,Comentario no disponible
Between,"Bad Acting ,Bad Actors,Bad Script horrible bad story","What is it with all these young actors these days?? They all walk around with one facial expression all the time, is that a requirement to get a foot inside the door in Hollywood?

Can you act?

No What can you do? Look stone faced all the time.

Great! You get the job

In Between is sort of a new version, of :Under the dome.Only this version has everyone over a certain age die of a mystic deceased ,and leave a city full of Tweens.(oh the horror)

Which of course involve the usual stereotypes. The drop out,the dope dealer,the blue color worker down on his luck, the teen pregnancy chick(guess they substituted her for the easy/promiscuous one,which is they one usually use)

The worst part is you don't really care about any of the characters,they are totally uninteresting.You don't even get a reason to care. Don't waste your time,unless your die hard fan of the under the dome"
Between,These reviews are unfair,"People focus too much on trying to find the bad and tear it to pieces. Just enjoy it for what it is, a simple TV show. Some of the negative reviews are completely over the top and totally unjustified. I personally really liked it and it has a lot of potential. Rating it so poorly will just get the show axed without it having a chance. Some of the best TV shows around started off slowly, Breaking Bad for example, and you can't fairly judge a show after only 6 episodes, I'd have given up on so many shows if I didn't give them a chance. I'm looking forward to season 2 if we ever get one due to people being so awfully harsh with their reviews."
Between,Won't Let My PVR Record This Show,"This show is terrible, the production is terrible, the acting poor, the script is very poor, the lines are laughable. All in all it looks like a second rate Canadian production.

If I was one of these actors I would refuse to read this script but work is work I guess. I was looking forward to this show as it was hyped on City TV here in Ontario, Canada but after watching the first 30 minutes it was obvious that this show did not have what it takes to be satisfactory.

Timing of actors entering the scenes was a joke in parts and the guards at the fence had lines that made you cringe.

This show needs to succumb to a virus!"
Between,Why are Most Canadian TV Shows Fuzzy and Blurry ?,"Disappointed because it looked like someone had recorded the original with a cam corder and showed us the copy, was very bothersome that I couldn't get a clear picture unless they were outside in the sunshine. This seems true of most Canadian shows (I assume because of the fuzziness that it is indeed Canadian but could be wrong). And since when is finding food for a month old baby such a crisis ? They never say the mother couldn't breast feed but the baby didn't exactly need a ham sandwich, there had to be tons of baby formula in the town that since it was the only infant, both premix and powder. The story line isn't bad, and the writers hit the mark a couple times and for that I finished both seasons. Not the most enjoyable but with the other junk Netflix has been offering lately I have to say it was watchable. Just wish they demanded better quality, I watched it on a tv and two different devices so the blurriness wasn't my imagination."
Between,"Bad Scripts, Subpar Acting, and Lack of Focus","I will start off by saying that I did watch the entirety of the show, so it wasn't incredibly boring. The original premise of the show is totally up my alley. That said, it was far from good.

There are too many main characters all pulling the story in different directions that don't necessarily click well together. And on top of that, all of the characters are rather unlikable; I can't think of a single one that I had any sort of investment in. This is only made worse by the fact that the acting is AWFUL and they all have flat affect. Oh, our world as we know it is in ruins? Our parents and many others we're close to have just died? You wouldn't have any idea that was the case if you just watched snippet of the show since it got way too caught up in nonsensical drama while only occasionally revisiting the plot."
Between,YA sci-fi TV,"The town of Pretty Lake has a population of eight thousand. Something is killing anyone over 22. In a few days, the town is quarantined by the military and soon all the adults are dead. Wiley (Jennette McCurdy) is a pregnant teen. Melissa is her religious sister. Her friend Adam is the smart kid accepted into MIT. Chuck Lott is the entitled rich kid. He clashes with the Creeker brothers, Pat and troublemaker Ronnie. Gord signed up with the military but is left with little sister Frances after his grandfather's death. Mark is a prisoner who finds himself the sole survivor.

This is basically trying to be a YA sci-fi TV show. It's one way to get hot young teens into one spot. Like the others, the premise gets a bit wonky. The arbitrary age of twenty two seems way too arbitrary. Otherwise, there is a bit of YA fun with this weak Under the Dome premise. This Netflix show was able to get two short seasons. I doubt there are more coming. It kinda runs out of steam as it gets closer to the outside world."

Fauda,Changed my views on the conflict,"I am American. I am biased.

With that out of the way, I wanted to... no, felt that I HAD to write a review about Fauda. Being completely honest with myself, I can't review this show based on ""realism"" or the whether the portrayal of ideological differences are genuine or not; I'm not exposed to that on a daily basis like those in the Middle East are. What I can review is how this show changed my mind and opinion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it made me feel.

I went into this viewing with a prideful appreciation of Israel (I still have one) and expected to see an action-packed thriller about undercover operations. You do get that, don't get me wrong, but that's not the point of the show. What you get from this show is a very poignant lesson about the physical, emotional, spiritual, and ideological toll that is felt in the battle that this show is portraying. You get the sense that what you are viewing is real. The writers do a masterful job of convincing you to sympathize with even the most unwavering of Hamas supporters and warriors and with the Israelis tasked with hunting them down. You get a front row seat to the endless killing that is carried out by both sides for reasons that are not even clear to the triggermen. ""An eye for an eye"", to what end? There is no Hollywood romance sideplots, no flashy explosions or high speed car chases through oncoming traffic, only death and despair.

This show has been incredibly difficult for me to describe to my friends and family, and I can only tell them what it's about and why I believe it's not a biased depiction of the real war going on. But I can't describe how you feel watching this show. It's profound and eye opening. All I know is that we're all human, we all mourn the same way."
Fauda,"Action packed, but with characters that are three dimensional. Excellent.","I'm amazed at how the Israelis can make such high level series like this, dealing with such intense subjects relating to dealing with the Palestinians, but still manage to be fairly even-handed and treat both sides sympathetically - even terrorists. I think it's this that makes Fauda so good. Yes, you're on the side of the Israeli team - sort of their undercover SAS squad dealing with Palestinian terrorists - but you also see the other side's viewpoint. Fauda is violent and action-packed, but all the characters, on both sides, have depth and believability. Watched all three series in a couple of weeks. Well worth the time."
Fauda,Captivating,"I have never lived in the West Bank, and thus cannot speak to whether the script is as severely biased as some claim. What I do know is that among those who voice this particular criticism, there does appear to be roughly the same number of people who think it is demonizing the Palestinians as there are those thinking it's the Israelis that are getting the unfair treatment.

Why I don't believe it is possible to ever be completely unbiased, I do not get the sense that the show is trying to convince me one way or the other. This tale of ruthless killing and unending retribution does not, in my opinion, make any attempt at justification. I believe it a story, not primarily about the common Palestinian or Israeli, but about the combatants on both sides.

However, I can see how a passionate supporter of either side might find this show a bit unpalatable. Those who simply want their convictions justified can probably find something more to their liking elsewhere. Propaganda is easy to come by these days. The rest of us can enjoy this well made fiction, listen to the beautiful semitic languages and be captivated by the awesome culture and piety of these ancient civilizations.

I pray for lasting peace among all the seed of Abraham."
Fauda,The best Israeli series made until now.,"The best Israeli series made until now.

Surprisingly authentic, played out great, well filmed.

The highlight is a language, Arabic language, spoken language, music to the ear.

No language barriers ""gib AL hawia""(Bring your ID card).

Excellent playing actors.

Faithful to reality.

A Must see Series to Arabs and Israelis. Muslims and Jews.

For those who want to see and understand how a country forced to operate in an environment full of terror driven of national motivation.

And anyone who enjoys quality action series."
Fauda,"It grabs your attention, but it can make viewers hate Arabs or Israelis even more.","I just finished watching season 3, and in short, it is a good series that depict the life in both Israel and Palestine, like what they eat, their culture and traditions. So in the beginning, you feel hopeful that Israelis want to learn from Arabs and vice versa, but then, the series become very cyinical, when in fact the only reason they ""learn each other language and culture"" is to creates pain and sorrow.

I wanted to root for the Shin Bet team headed by Doron, but I couldn't. The lack of morals and restraint when inmocent Palestinians are involved, just show how imbalanced this war is. They have no policy of taking prisoners. They simply shoot to kill, even enemies that already surrendered.

Also, they recruit informanta and collaborators among Palestinians, who endanger themselves to help Israelis, but Israel never helps or rescues them, so normally they end up dead.

And another irony, is that the more terrorist they kill, the more replacements they create, because all the orphans, siblings that become destitute and homeless (it shows Israel blowing up houses of innocent people), so in the end offering their life to Hamas is the only resource left.

The show missed an opportunity to show how to de escalate the conflict. In the end, it jsut fuels more hate and sectarianism"
Fauda,An impressive Israeli thriller series,"This Israeli series is centred on a counter-terrorist squad working to stop Hamas terrorists operating in the West Bank. This involves them frequently going undercover into situations where they must pass as Palestinian; the slightest mistake will put them in grave danger. In the opening episode we are introduced to Doron Kavillio, a retired member of the team who is asked to help when a terrorist leader who was thought dead re-emerges. Soon he is back in this deadly world. Their first operation goes wrong; the target is wounded but escapes and his innocent brother is killed. This leads to tensions rising and revenge attacks. While this storyline is wrapped up in the first season a new terrorist leader emerges in the second so it is effectively a continuation of the same story. The third season sees operations against another terrorist which leads to the kidnapping of two young Israelis. They are taken to the Gaza Strip... a location far more dangerous than the West Bank.

I really enjoyed this series; I can't comment on its actual authenticity but it certainly felt real. We observe characters on both sides of the divide and while it is clear that Doron and his team are the 'good guys' there are plenty of sympathetic Palestinian characters, and the Israeli's actions aren't always what one would call moral. There is plenty of tension in every episode and early on it becomes clear that just because somebody is set up as a main character doesn't mean they can't get killed. The cast does an impressive job bringing their characters to life although as I relied on subtitles I can't comment on the quality of accents or Arabic spoken by the team... something that would need to be near perfect in reality. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the genre.

These comments are based on watching the series in Hebrew/Arabic with English subtitles."
Fauda,Intense action drama that will blow you away,"Fauda is a very intense and rough show about the Israeli - Palestinian conflict. No side is a saint or hero. All means and methods are used from both sides. Sometimes with success and sometimes big failure. Terrorism, revenge, fight for injustice, all causes are there.

The show is very well produced with a nerve and authentic feel that is not present in similar US productions.

The characters are strong and very well performed by actors and actresses, unknown to me but nevertheless stellar performances.

Key character is Doron, an undercover Israeli agent that is both prudent privately and ruthless as a professional. But he is often held back by his own emotional turmoil, impulsively guided by his natural instincts and careless maneuvers.

Also the acting and development of the character Walid, on the Palestinian side, is absolutely splendid.

The action is constantly there and it is impossible to predict what is going to happen next. This really brings an intensity and always keeping you on the edge. Still it feels natural and not overdone.

The show has been critisized for being Isreeli propaganda. It is an Israeli production so it might be a small bias here, but still there are good people and bad people on both sides. And both sides can be totally ruthless without any sense of moral and ethics. So all in all the show is a great two-sided portrait of this ongoing conflict. It is very intense and unique because you see both sides of the conflict.

A very refreshing alternative to traditional US action productions. Don't miss Fauda!"
Fauda,A captivating and engrossing program.,"Kudos to other reviewers who intimately understand the Palestine/Israel conflict. Their reviews are in-depth and broadly cover the topic.

Allow me to present the perspective of someone who knew little more than the fact two countries are battling over land. One heavily represented in the media as an ally of the Free World, the other portrayed as a nation of extremists and terrorists. And this from the occasional media I watch and hear in Australia (another allied nation).

So here's the kicker: Fauda, an Israeli series depicting the very conflict I've just mentioned, manages to infuse its tale with humanity, love, family and friendship. And it does so on both sides of the fence. Two clear enemies, major stakeholders in the war they wage, are shown with objectivity and fairness. Both men are flawed, both men are biased and heavily indoctrinated in their cause. Yet both have wives and kids they adore, and both men wage their war in the hopes of creating a better future for their families.

That being said, war is ugly and the price paid is often high. Fauda does not stray from this reality and the ripple effect is ever-present, slicing its way through the lives of those embroiled in the fight; some guilty, some innocent.

Woven through these fundamental connections are the various political and military involvements. Watching the puppet masters at work is both interesting and disturbing. Nothing is ever straightforward and Fauda is no exception. There's always someone watching or listening and there's always someone a step ahead of you.

In essence, Fauda is wonderfully acted, riveting, fast-paced and even educational. It is a superior series and deserving of the praise it has received. I truly look forward to Season 2."
Fauda,"Brilliant: gritty, engaging, enthralling and thought-provoking drama","(Review updated after Season 4).

Doron Kavillio was once a member of an elite Israeli counter-terrorism team. Seeking the quiet life he has retired to own a vineyard. His peaceful existence is shattered when he learns that a Hamas military leader, the mastermind behind the deaths of scores of Israelis, a man he was convinced he had killed, is alive and well and planning another attack. He quickly rejoins his team in their hunt for Abu Ahmed.

Superb drama. Shows well the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, from both sides. Solid, very gritty plot: feels very realistic and there are no indispensable characters. Not at all predictable: some great twists and turns, all without feeling like twists just for twists sake. Great action scenes too: once again quite realistic in feel - not over-the-top gung ho stuff.

From the outset the series also demonstrates the vicious cycle that is the struggle in the Middle East, as violence just begets violence. One side will kill someone from the other side, and the other side will avenge them, perpetuating the cycle. Also shows how innocent civilians get pulled into this cycle: people determined to stay out of the conflict get sucked in once a relative is killed.

There's also a great sense of pointlessness to it all. The Israeli team is tasked with tracking down and killing high profile terrorists / operatives. When they accomplish this there is a sense of achievement but they know it will be short-lived as someone will just replace that person and the whole thing starts again, never to end. This is even admitted to in a discussion by two Israeli agents in one of the reflective moments in the series.

Amongst all this there are also some great sub-plots involving family life and relationships, making for quite engaging viewing as you get to know the characters and what they're experiencing behind the scenes.

Season ratings: S1: 9/10, S2: 10, S3: 10, S4 9.5. S1 was less well-rounded in that it didn't show much of the family/relationship stuff and concentrated almost exclusively on the intrigue and action. From S2 onwards the writers added more depth to the plots and characters. S4 started strongly but dragged a bit in the middle episodes before returned to its best. Incredibly tense and powerful ending."
Fauda,review after Season 3,"The most important message of Fauda is that there are no good guys.

Both sides in the show are doing essentially the same thing, one under the pretense of maintaining law and order, the other under the pretense of freedom fighting. However, if you're watching Fauda in order to learn more about Israeli - Palestinian conflict, you're obviously in the wrong place. This is not and never pretends to be a documentary.

Season 1 and Season 2 offer a bleak insight into the lives of the Israeli special forces team trained to infiltrate the Palestinian side in plain clothes. Their job is literally nerve wrecking, both on and off duty.

However, Season 3 takes more of a Hollywood approach, meaning that we're led to believe that a group of highly trained individuals may take on a (small) army and emerge victorious. Therefore you might as well stop watching Fauda after Season 2."
Fauda,Good action TV,"I didn't watch this to fully understand the complexities of the Israeli and Arab conflict and to believe it represents fact. That out of the way its a good, well acted action drama series. The very end to series 3 was also quite unexpected. Never going to win an Oscar but a very good and not too taxing to watch action series. I recommend this. Binged on Netflix using Hebrew dubbed into English and with the Arabic in English subtitles."
Fauda,Became a little too much like an ultra-violent soap opera in third series,"Liked the first two seasons a lot, but series three definitely tipped over into melodrama, involving too many improbable coincidences and contrived situations for comfort. The show even became quite soapy in places, with the Doron character sweeping every female character off her feet, in spite of looking like Vin Diesel's tubbier brother! He was a problem for me in other ways as well, mainly to do with his almost pathologically unwillingness to obey orders. Would any special forces unit really go to war with someone so unstable in their ranks? Still worth watching, but lost quite a bit of its realistic feel."
Fauda,Getting more and more ridiculous,Comentario no disponible
Fauda,An amazing show....,"I don't know exactly how many series were made about Israeli palectinian conflict, but this one is, I am sure, among the best. Taut, sharp, gripping, pulled by an awesome actors directing, above the best I have ever seen in a TV series, but unfortunately smashed by some mistakes that should have been avoided. The gunfights are for me the weak points; Palestioians are too easily shot, like in a sideshow shooting gallery, see? So, the Israelis seem to be the super heroes, and I think that's pretty lousy, if you consider the quality of the show. The same as I you sa a fly in a bowl of milk. The contrast is too obvious. But, I repeat, acting is here over the top. The second season is the best of the series so far, and the third is, for my taste, too much focused on the hostage case, and this is different fro the second season. But the sad and totally unpredictable ending saves this third season, that, why not, asks for a fourth seaon. Let's cross our fingers."
Fauda,So good!,"I have never seen an original Israeli TV shows before. Since the war on Hamas started, after initial shock, I've decided to look it up a bit further. So this show popped up on my radar.

This show is amazing! It's everything the Hollywood gritty shows are trying to be, only so much better and more realistic. Both me and my wife started watching and we've watched 4 seasons in a span of 6 days, missing sleep time, and it was absolutely worth it! My wife who doesn't like or care too much about the action scenes, even got emotional toward the end of 4'th season. That's how good it is.

The actors aren't ""Hollywood pretty"", but they are perfect and amazing in their respected roles. They aren't superheroes. But a hard boiled professionals with deep psychological wounds, deeply engaged in the conflict, all while embracing both cultures. For the most part they speak Hebrew and Arabic, and it's perfect for the show (yes, subtitles are a good thing). I especially loved phone conversations when it was Hebrew on one side and Arabic on another.

I don't believe this show can have a good remake in Hollywood. It just doesn't build like this. Western values don't work in Arab world. Only hoping to see more seasons of the same. Maybe with different actors as they get older, but the same spirit.

Amazing!"
Fauda,Good series.,"There is a story to tell from both sides and I clearly see that in this series.

Acting is really done well, effects are good. I keep on watching since the story is tense."
Fauda,MAGNIFICENT,"Very personal and dramatic.

The characters are great and the relationship between them is enlightening and fascinating.

There is bloody action and vicious deceit within a torn community. The cost of human life amongst divided families and toxic relationships is staggering.

It isn't pretty but it's insightful and very compelling to watch. The language and respect bestowed between the characters is ultimately meaningless as death and destruction will surely follow. The level of secrecy and surveillance that pervades everyday life is hard to fathom. Meetings between families are carried out using a high level of security that is frightening and not conducive to trust or a normal life."
Fauda,Immersive Political Thriller,"Season 4 is as interesting as earlier seasons and some. This time the action and the drama take place outside of the West Bank and Gaza and into Brussels, the Golan Heights and over to Lebanon. The production team led by Lior Raz, co-creator and lead actor, succeeds in sustaining our interest and holding our attention.

To be sure, the series gives us a glimpse of the security apparatus of Israel and how it works to defend itself from threats from within. But, at the same time, it shines a light on the Palestinian struggle. As the viewer finds himself immersed in the action and the drama, he can't help but wonder whether the Palestinian question will ever be resolved considering that the issues seem to be intractable.

Engaging cast. Season 4 offers more in terms of drama. We witness how the topnotch team of Eli is worn down and succumbs to the incessant pressure that their work inherently entails.

After 4 seasons, we get to know the actors better. For me, my personal favorites are Lior Raz, Yaakov Zadi Daniel, Itzik Cohen, and Rona-Lee Shima. Newcomers Lucy Ayoub and Inbar Lavi are impressive.

The series is by no means over. And I trust that Lior Raz and Avi Isaacharoff haven't run out of interesting ang engaging stories to spin based on their own experiences as intelligence agents."
Fauda,very good! Recommend it!,"Reading some of the reviews I have noticed that those who sympathize with the Arabs hated the series and those who sympathize with Israel or don't know much about the conflict loved the show. Knowing a lot about the conflict, I can say that the series is a little bit GENTLE to what really happens in real life. The conflict is deeper and unfortunately will not be solved in my lifetime or (in my opinion) ever. However, the show gives a semi-realistic glimpse of what happens in the area. The actors are authentic, raw, and some of them have lived it in real life during their military service. I loved it! The acting is great, the filming is good and can't wait for the 3rd season that is now being filmed."
Fauda,Flat cliche Israeli propaganda,"There are too many films and series about the Israeli Mosad and IDF to go into. Suffice it to say this one simply tries to throw in every known cliche and just comes off bland. It is almost a parody of itself in that only the israelis could have the lead of a balding, obese hairy middle-aged man be the love interest to a hot professional, younger Arab woman. It is unapologetic about killing Arab civilians in the course of their operations from the beginning of the episode. So, if you like watching creepy israelis having sex with their subordinates/co-workers' wives, all while killing Arabs, then this is your wet dream."
Fauda,"Great, Good,Not so Good",1st series was excellent. 2nd series was good 3 series is just meh? I was looking forward to another season of Fauda but I was left disappointed.
Fauda,Intense and Engaging,"Wow , just great is all i can say. Didn't seem to have any bias. it demonstrated how complex the conflict really is. Its great that they show how there is pain on both sides. I also loved how the actors spoke a mix of Hebrew and Arabic. Arabs and Jews came together to make this show and I think that is really great. This is super addictive so watch out! I watched 6 episodes in a row and I definitely don't regret it one bit. Definitely recommend this show, you wont regret it. The acting, the filming, the effects-its all truly amazing. Unfortunately , I think this show only has one season, which is really upsetting to me. Hopefully the series will continue for as long a possible. 10/10"
Fauda,Doron is an insubordinate goon,"I loved seasons 1 and 2. Walid was a great and memorable villain. When season 4 was about to be released I went back and watched all the seasons again. Doron becomes more irritating each season. He doesn't follow orders and ends up getting people hurt or killed. Plus, the villains after Walid are not memorable or are sort of sympathetic characters radicalized by Doron. The gullible boxer, or his newly-released from prison father. Doron is a bull in a China shop and a pouty, self-absorbed man-child prone to tantrums. Please just fire this guy already! The women always fall for him for some inexplicable reason and his kisses are stomach churning as they sound like he is slurping soup. Season 4 was still entertaining, but the plot holes are more glaring (the convoluted plan involving tricking the police officer into going to Syria) and it is difficult to root for Doron as the seasons go on. I dropped my rating from 8 to 7 after watching Season 4 because the show and Doron went downhill."
Fauda,Season 3 is laughable,Comentario no disponible
Fauda,"Ignore the negative reviews, they are folks with an agenda","There are many negative reviews, saying that this is not anything close to reality. The reality is yes, there is some dramatic license, but much of it is based on truth.

From what I know, having a connection to the production, only the characters are dramaticized, but the storylines reflect the reality, sad as it is.

As for the absurd comments about the Arabic spoken. Many of the actors are native Arabic speakers, so there is no basis to them.

There's a reason why this show is so popular, it's because it shows balance. It also let's talk understand both sides, caught in a miserable situation."

Resurrection: Ertugrul,I fell in love with this series,"I am a Christian, but I have never enjoyed a series as much as this ever,! I learnt so much about the spirit and traditions of the Islamic faith and was amazed at how passionate Muslims are about their faith in God. If only the world today had a leader like Ertugrul. I was struck by his determination that all people no matter their beliefs would live in a just political system together. I had lost faith in God..but this series has brought me back to my God. Thank you....Ertugrul the series.."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Best female character I've ever seen,"As a man, I love this series for the adventure and fighting and great plot. Not to forget the great costumes - extremely well done.

However, the biggest surprise I had was falling in love with Mother Hayme, the mother of the lead character and matriarch of the tribe.

I can easily say I have never seen a role of a strong, traditional motherly figure portrayed this well in any film or TV series. She is a strong figure that forms the backbone of her tribe - honoring her husband's lead role, but never afraid to point him in the right direction if he makes a mistake. Any time he is absent, she takes control and makes sure the tribe has sound leadership. Not to mention how she guides her sons through their difficulties and fights. Solid acting and all around great character!

Oh and Ertugrul is pretty cool too! ;)"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Worth watching!,"This is series worth watching. The storyline is excellent, every episode end in a cliffhanger making you watch the next, again and again and again. The only reason I did not give it 10 stars is the english subscripts that is not good, a lot of spelling and grammatical errors, but despite this, you can follow the series easily. What I enjoyed, was to see a world portrayed from the Muslim side. As a Christian it made me think that we should rather look at the similarities between the Christian believe and the Muslim believe, than the differences, and start from there. The underlying values seems to be very much the same. It is a long series, but definitely worth watching."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,History Made Personal,"Most excellent entertainment offering a wide range of pleasures for the viewer to partake in. History, adventure, love, intrigue, drama, costumes, suspense, betrayal, life, death, with very well captured living styles for back then from herding animals to making clothing and goods, weapons and their daily diet too. Interaction on a grand scale not only with their fellow tribesman but with all cultures and peoples friendly or not is realistically acted out with the end result being that the viewer is captured and held from episode to episode. Have you ever watched something so good that you wished it wouldn't end? How about you wanted more and there was none? Relax here completely for there are so many continuing sagas that have so much going on that one not only gets lost in them but if you let go entirely, you forget its being acted and directed out and have no trouble that this live history as it was and is. What greater entertainment is that? You will take a side of your choosing with the different actors and characters and learn to love and hate with them and one thing this movie dishes up well is suspense and not far behind is the second best thing they do which is to allow you to see those that have it coming get their comeuppance. In fact you cant wait but it comes in due time thus the viewer remains ready for the hook and that hook comes with satisfaction and closure. But wait, another injustice goes down and the whole tug on your emotions begins again. Well done to all actors in this movie. They wore their hearts on their sleeves and gave all they had making it extra-ordinary and exceptional. Notice too the beautiful horses of all colors and how well they perform awe natural. What they didn't spend in lavish backgrounds, thousands of extras and set pieces they more than made up for in story telling and allowing the viewer to travel along without effort. Highly recommend eating during some of these episodes as they eat meat, bread, feta cheese, porridge's, rich fresh milk and dried fruits. Have more than one snack standing by as well with a tasty drink. Great movie for sunflower seeds or pistachio nuts. Do you want to know what it was like back then and there? Start watching and prepare to be unprepared for this is not your casual viewing experience but a more intimate one. Added bonus? I learned a little Arabic and quite bit about early Islam and its practices. These people loved God and included him in everything. Humility abounds! Enjoy!"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,TV series about justice.,"Best TV series ever made, absolutely mind blowing I can't praise this enough, some great acting and a very long series but when 5 seasons have finished you will be yearning for more."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Sublime Ertugrul,"This series is a must watch. It has an excellent story, coupled with great performances and perfect cinematography. Entertaining from start to finish with an inspiring message of belief that good triumps over evil."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Legend.,"This is a story which removes the negative stereotype that is associated with Islam in current society, and shows the history of it's proud Ghazi and Beys. A story based on the father of the man who founded the Ottoman empire, created to give insight in the culturally diverse past often ignored. A tale which can be used to inspire many of all beliefs and learn the meaning of what it means to live."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Totally amazing series that pulled me in from the very first episode!,"First let me start by telling readers that I have never written a review for a movie or series. Second, let me say this... I'm a Texan all my life- lived in the country growing up - and the city during my adult life. I never knew much about Muslims or their faith, and to tell you the truth - I never cared to know. Third, I have never watched a foreign movie- and friends/family thought I was crazy for having to read everything that was said by each character. I don't even know how I ended up watching this except for one day I was board and starting looking at previews. I watched the preview and went straight to season 1, episode 1. Once it started ... I was hooked!!! I couldn't stop watching it. I watched it every chance I could get. That's all I thought about was trying to get home so I could watch the next episode. I binged watched most every night and sometimes it was filled with so much drama and excitement that I couldn't turn it off and go to sleep. The production, the sword fighting, the music, the drama was action packed every moment. The actors where unbelievably good! One thing that I can definitely say, if most Muslims are like the character and his family in this series- what a loving, caring, religion it is. It shocked me how much their religion played a part of their everyday life. Praying all the time, always trying to follow their religious convictions and ""their cause."" Everything about the series was just magnificent! From the script, to the characters, to the unbelievable music throughout- it was done by the best of the best! I learned so much about the history of these Turkish people and I know from reading and studying about the making of this series, that they had the best historians and professors that helped put all the information and historical facts together. It is fiction, but most of the history is true. They added story lines to make it like a drama. I almost cried when I realized that season 5 was the last season. I quickly googled to try and see if they would pick back up and continue a season 6 sometime soon. There was talk about doing it but nothing has transpired as of yet. However, the main characters (Ertugrul) youngest son Osman, was made out to be a world power as he got older. They had dreams about how great of a leader he would be and powerful. Apparently they have a spin off of this series which Osman ends up starting the Ottoman Empire as he grows older. It was mentioned that is was not on Netflix yet, but you could see it on YouTube. It was aired recently on Turkish television and was very popular with the viewers. So I googled it and read a lot of history on this leader. Just amazing. And this series is back in the time frame of the 1200- 1400's. Back when their was fierce fighting over land and tribes - as they migrated to find peaceful lands - which didn't seem to ever happen. Just amazing history, and amazing culture and religion. It really did open my eyes and I have a totally different view of this culture now- even though I'm Christian. Please please watch this series. I hope you will be hooked just like I was and continue to watch and learn. Just wish it wouldn't end! Season 5 has 88 episodes... I watched 81-87 last night and this morning and stopped. I just can't bring myself to watch the very last one right now. Lol."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,TGOT!!!,"Admittedly I was saddened when Game Of Thrones ended. The adrenaline rush was crazy! This show was recommended to me by Netflix. I figured I'd give it a shot. So glad I did!! This show is GREAT!! My Turkish Game Of Thrones!! I am hooked on the storylines and character development. It has it all...treachery, deceit, sword play!! But it also has hope, love and faith. I am emotionally involved!! I am happy when the characters are happy, and sad when they are sad....(It's made me cry!!) I am on season 2 and I know I will be extremely satisfied, emotionally exhausted and sad when it's over.... Love, love ...love."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,10. Could not pull away from the beginning!,"I have seen many series and movies but this was by far the greatest acting, fighting scenes, love stories and the love of their religion put me to shame with my own. I am more determined to speak to my God and let others see him through me! I am thrilled at seeing a Turkish film of their history and everyday life then and I am sure now. Thank you for producing this and thank you Netflix for airing this fine historical series. I hope to see more from Turkey and help me to understand and learn their culture."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Unecessarily long,"I liked the serie but the only problem that stopped me from watching it is its length. Season 2 is 100 episodes on netflix and full of unecessary scenes !! If the length was reduced it would be great, but most people wont watch it because of its length ."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Excellent,"I haven't watched the entire series yet but what I have seen so far is nothing short of excellent.

Brilliant acting and an intriguing storyline.

It is slow moving so I had to skip some scenes and sections but if you have ample time you could easily watch it all without getting bored."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Good Series About Turkish History,"A very good series about Turkish history. This series was a good production about Ottoman. It made several series on this subject, but none of them reflect reality. Previously there wasn't such series. It was a nice job for Turkey. Unfortunately we are behind other countries. I really take enjoy watching this series. A successful business. This series will come to a better place. I just want to mention one point. I especially love the battle scenes. But bloody scenes too fake. They should show a little more attention to detail. If you pay attention to them this will be a better series. A number of really useful for Turkey. I advise... 7/10"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,"Weird cinematography, mediocre plot","The cinematography was very weird. Almost looked like the whole thing was shot by some newbie student. I understand Turkish entertainment industry is still quite primitive but a show that is being pushed around by Prime Ministers should have some artistic edge to them. The plot at least from what I understand isn't quite complex. And most people who are watching this show are watching it for the religion, Islam, rather than the merits of its own. To a non-Muslim, this show offers nothing new. It's eulogizing a religion, mocking the Christ's Templars, and offers nothing new to the table."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Incredible,"The best series for anyone who wants to learn about the true, vast and gorgeous Islamic history."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Mustttttt watch,"Has there anything being made on television history better than this series ? The answer is No. by far I've never seen anything as beautifully directed, acted & produced than Ertugrul!! Can't stop talking about it. This drama can be easily compared with the top Hollywood series & still I'm sure the level of acting & class will be better than anything ever made. It's a must watch! Especially the fact that it's based on true incidents, just makes it more worthwhile to watch."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Best Show next to Game of Thrones,"Me and my wife really enjoy this show. It reminds us very much of Game of Thrones but without dragons. Good acting, great fighting scenes. The Story is addictive and told in a great way.

This is first Turkish series we have watched as we can not speak Turkish but was recommended to watch by a friend. We will definitely recommend it to others!"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Excellent Show with so much History,"My sons and I have been watching this show for a month now. We watch a couple of episodes a night. Being a Roman Catholic and also my love for history this show is excellent. No one was perfect, the Crusaders did was they thought was right, the Mongols and their dreams, but the Turks were fighting for their very existence and a land to settle. This show has everything and Hayme Ana looks so much like my late mother that at times I cannot hold back my tears. Enjoy this wonderful production."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,One the the best series i have ever seen,"Dirilis: Ertugrul is one the best TV shows I have ever seen if not the best. once you started you will not be able to stop watching it. I really liked the story line, the script and of course the actors chosen. Every episode is 2 hours, I know it a lot but you will not feel it because of the excitement of it. I highly recommend this TV show."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Halal Version Of Game Of Thrones,"This is a must watch... what makes this awesome is the fact that it promotes Unity, compassion, kindness, loyalty and overall a slap in the face of media that tempt to promote the religion of Islam as barbaric. After all it is all fact based on historical events and proves how good hearted Muslim and Christians worked together as one and together were also against terrorists."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,Completely blown away,"Watched the first episode purely by chance and betcame addicted to it. Even though Turkish isn't a language I can speak and understand, even faintly, the story line is exceptionally well written and easy to follow. The characters, the script, the acting are all superb - Bravo Team Ertugrul! On Netflix only seasons 1 & 2 are currently available, can't wait till season 3!!!! Keep at it guys - you're doing an exception job!!!"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,It's nothing special,"Do not deserve 1 star but don't deserve 7.9 rating either.. these ratings are mostly givern by people of pakistan and India who have only watched their saas bahu type trash serials..so it was awesome for them ..but after so much hype..when i watched it , it was nothing They showed the whole history different,5% facts and others are just made by themselves.. Moreover,action is just so dull...vfx , cgi is poor..acting is also just average.. storyline is just a little better and bigger version of Indian serials and oh yess..it has above 400 episodes..each of 1 hour..and it's not worth it"
Resurrection: Ertugrul,authentic feeling,"This series thru Netflix is the longest series I've ever watched..im thru season 1 and into season 2. This is a very Authentic feeling series and the characters really ring true. It is an incredibly talented cast and the sets are lush and believable with no details lacking. Even with subtitles which are often comically misspelled with poor English the show progresses smoothly with surprises all the time. I think it is an excellent interpretation of the true Muslim spirit and portrays Muslim saints and followers with a more realistic feeling that could cut across religious lines and reach a western audience.. The story portrays a Muslim version of the events of the day which is not often found in western cultural history. There is very little CGI that doesn't look real. The bad persons are really bad and the good persons are really good! with some exceptions! The nomadic life of the early Turkish people is portrayed with astounding realism. It can get a bit soapy at times and they really take their time in unfolding the plot so i found my self skimming thru some sections especially in season 2 but even now im not doing that anymore as the plot is very rich with emotional details of the lives of the characters and it does tend to grip the viewer. Having now reached the end of series 2 I have a few more points of criticism as follows:: The subtitles are translations of the Turkish dialect and it is very uneven and looks to be the work of more than one or 2 persons. The translations make the characters appear at times very fanatical and hateful towards non muslims referring them as non muslims and thus deserving of death! This , I believe, to be a mistranslation of the word for atheist or one who does not believe in a higher power. The subtitle non Muslim only appeared a few times in series 2 and thus I believe it was mistake which was corrected later on in the series. I hope that series 3 will provide a better translation for the subtitles..I very much enjoyed the series and I still cant believed I binged watched a 178 episode series over a period of 6 weeks! I hope that there will be a series 3 but even if there isn't it was well worth watching."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,"It's definitely something different, looks beautiful, but has problems","NOTE: I feel obligated to mention, that I'm reviewing this show as _entertainment_, as a TV-show, and I'm not commenting on the actual history or characters of history that it portrays. I have little exposure or knowledge about those things so I will not attempt to bring them in. This is based purely on the show, and I regard it as such. I will make a few anecdotal comments about these, but it will be apparent when this is the case.

I'm not completely buying all those 10/10 reviews voted crazily helpful, written by supposedly western reviewers. Influenced partly by those reviews I decided that it might be a good time to finally visit this show, since I had eyed it in the past in intrigue. It's definitely not a straight 10/10 show...

That being said, I'm not even halfway through the first season (these are some long seasons...) and have no intention of stopping as it's certainly interesting. But I had to come and share my thoughts in case someone else from the western sphere is thinking of checking it out and feels equally wary and suspicious of the flood of 10/10 reviews. I will gladly update the score and the review itself if it gets noticeably better (or worse, for that matter).

It's not a bad show at all. The scenery and the props look beautiful, and as for their authenticity in the time period, that I cannot comment. I am not familiar with the history of Middle-East, which is actually precisely one of the reasons why I thought it looked visually so interesting and beautiful -- it's certainly different from the western-centric shows I've been comsuming my entire life.

There's a recurring theme of cheesiness. I'm not sure how I feel about it just yet -- right now everything just feels corny, but the first seasons of any show tend to have that quality to them. Certain shows, like ""The Last Kingdom"" pull off this style of corny, but most don't make it work at all. There are a couple of sides to it:

Where western-centric historic entertainments seem to traditionally portray the Islamic peoples as the bad guys when there's an arc that has to do with them (usually crusades or something like that), this one doesn't shy away from reversing that dynamic completely and portraying the crusaders as these corny caricatures of evil people that just do evil things, seemingly out of joy or whatever. I find it's appropriate, and completely warranted, and I'm not going to be a hypocrite and act like that is in any way different from what a lot of western productions do. However, I find it equally cheesy when shows like Knightfall do similar things. It's just not really good writing in my opinion, no matter who does the writing. I had kinda hoped that the position of always (well, almost, in recent years there's been a lot of more complex and flattering writing and portrayals) being portrayed with ill intent would've allowed the writers to overcome the trope and be clever about it, but I guess people are the same, no matter where they hail from. And again, I'm not saying it's uncalled for, it definitely is, crusaders were foreign invaders with intent to conquer, kill and plunder, and the material I've read has not painted a very pretty picture about their methods. But it's still boring and dimensionless to watch (although I have to say there are a lot of things that take the focus and make you entertained anyway, but more on them later).

Then on other hand, some of the main (good) characters have so far been nothing short of perfect in terms of skill, mind and morale. Which is a little bland in my opinion. The timing in which some scenarios go down is just downright offensive to someone who's got a little bit accustomed to more complex and forward-looking writing of the recent years. I mean it's not a bad thing per se, it's certainly entertaining to have a classical hero saving the day with his buddies who don't get a scratch and all that, but I guess it feels a little old and musty by now.

I taste a lot of similar flavors here as I did with the ""Vikings"" show. I'm not sure where those flavors come from, since Vikings actually did a good job of humanizing the opposing forces (and even going as far as openly embracing the ""vikings are just plain bad guys"" theme!), but I think it has to do with the lead character, and him being charismatic and likable and has an authority and confidence to him. Or maybe it's the way it's filmed and edited, that could be it too. We do get scenes with leaders portraying the other sides of the conflicts, which is kind of similar to what Vikings does. I don't know.

The actor who delivers the lead character is very charismatic and has a very cool air about him. Again, the writers made him cheesily good in all things he does (so far). Also modest and humble... you know, perfect. But on the other hand that does increase the charsima of the character, and the actor does a very good job portraying this. He's a likable character (so far, anyway), and I think the only problem with him is the lackluster fighting choreography (I mean, most of the other actors have very convincing fighting scenes, whereas this dude is kind of laxly strolling around and doesn't have the same weight behind his swings and all that) and the corny writing.

The show shines when we follow this lead dude. It's actually very entertaining and very similar to ""The Last Kingdom"" that has Uthred, who's almost equally corny honestly. So it's not hindering the show all that much when you put it in perspective.

There's a lot of lovely details that a foreigner like me gets from a show like this. The recurring sayings (often about the islamic faith, but there are some others too) are interesting, even if they feel a little weird and over-the-top to someone who was raised mildly christian and turned atheist by his own accord very early on in life. It seems their god plays a big part in all they do. Which is fine, I'm not saying it's a bad thing, just feels a little weird (partly since I can't judge whether it's faith-backed propaganda or a realistic portrayal of the time).

Also, the clothing, the jewelry, the general visual styles are amazing. It's very different to what I'm accustomed to, and definitely interesting. I often thirst for a similar portrayal of my own country's history, where there were points in time where we weren't so close to the major European cultural strands. This, in a way, satiates that thirst somehow. Or, maybe it's about it just being different and interesting.

The scenery is just beautiful. The mention of the animals, the general way the people live and behave, it doesn't differ all that much from a western point of view. But then there's the huts, the way of life that is definitely very different, the clothings, and the people that do act different when looked at individually. It seems the influence of their god makes them a little bit humbler (and certain) than I'm accustomed to, though that might be a intentional (or forced?) propagandist maneuver to write the support cast that way. I don't know... I hate that I have to think about this, but I can't just turn it off either, seeing as how a lot of islamic authorities and states, even today, with unwavering support from their leaders, theologians and institutions, behead dissidents, hang non-hetero or otherwise different people and all that, a thing I can't in good consciousness simply ignore when a show has these themes.

It's also pretty funny to witness the absolutely unhinged, weird behaviour of the arabic leaders (I think that's what they are, it's hard to tell since the subtitles I found are not perfect exactly). They are written in a even cornier way than the European characters, and it's absolutely ridiculous I have to say, the way they just do the dumbest things because they are evil, without profiting from it or anything, just plain murdering people and smiling orgasmically. But they are hilarious a good way, since I think it's intended to be a comedic relief from the otherwise cheesy, preaching and serious tone of the show. Also, you can not NOT laugh at some of the actors who play the crusaders being regular Turkish shade of tan, but have a hilarious, obviously fake bright blonde wigs, akin to the children's wigs you see in markets, on their head :D Not very convincing, but then again I sympathize that it can be harder to find naturally Scandinavian looking actors who can also speak Turkish. Though most of these background characters never say a word, so I don't know what that's all about.

I mean I'm into it. It's different, it looks visually beautiful, people act in an interesting way (other than the leading cast or the antagonists who are just cheesy) and the actors do a good job, especially in the supporting roles. I also think Turkish (I think that is the language they use?) sounds beautiful to me (a thing I would not have expected to say, having their current dictator's speeches as my only previous exposure to the language). I have to admit that I find a lot of the characters pleasing to the eye as well, especially the very lead character.

I don't necessarily like the cheesiness, and the constant praise of their god (which I understand can be a very accurate portrayal of the time period, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing on its own), but it's entertaining enough.

I suspect it gets better with each season, as shows tend to do, until the one breaking season that falls flat and brings the whole thing down. According to the ratings, this one doesn't seem to have that specific season, so I'm optimistically waiting for what's going to happen."
Resurrection: Ertugrul,"Historically inaccurate, Uplifting, Amateur childish writing!!!","Historically inaccurate, Uplifting, Amateur childish writing!!!

For such an important historical and geographical event we the viewers expected some great TV and cinema! Instead Gunay and Bozdag ruined it with a very bad storyline, direction hence production."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,I fell in love with this series,"I am a Christian, but I have never enjoyed a series as much as this ever,! I learnt so much about the spirit and traditions of the Islamic faith and was amazed at how passionate Muslims are about their faith in God. If only the world today had a leader like Ertugrul. I was struck by his determination that all people no matter their beliefs would live in a just political system together. I had lost faith in God..but this series has brought me back to my God. Thank you....Ertugrul the series.."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Best female character I've ever seen,"As a man, I love this series for the adventure and fighting and great plot. Not to forget the great costumes - extremely well done.

However, the biggest surprise I had was falling in love with Mother Hayme, the mother of the lead character and matriarch of the tribe.

I can easily say I have never seen a role of a strong, traditional motherly figure portrayed this well in any film or TV series. She is a strong figure that forms the backbone of her tribe - honoring her husband's lead role, but never afraid to point him in the right direction if he makes a mistake. Any time he is absent, she takes control and makes sure the tribe has sound leadership. Not to mention how she guides her sons through their difficulties and fights. Solid acting and all around great character!

Oh and Ertugrul is pretty cool too! ;)"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Worth watching!,"This is series worth watching. The storyline is excellent, every episode end in a cliffhanger making you watch the next, again and again and again. The only reason I did not give it 10 stars is the english subscripts that is not good, a lot of spelling and grammatical errors, but despite this, you can follow the series easily. What I enjoyed, was to see a world portrayed from the Muslim side. As a Christian it made me think that we should rather look at the similarities between the Christian believe and the Muslim believe, than the differences, and start from there. The underlying values seems to be very much the same. It is a long series, but definitely worth watching."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,History Made Personal,"Most excellent entertainment offering a wide range of pleasures for the viewer to partake in. History, adventure, love, intrigue, drama, costumes, suspense, betrayal, life, death, with very well captured living styles for back then from herding animals to making clothing and goods, weapons and their daily diet too. Interaction on a grand scale not only with their fellow tribesman but with all cultures and peoples friendly or not is realistically acted out with the end result being that the viewer is captured and held from episode to episode. Have you ever watched something so good that you wished it wouldn't end? How about you wanted more and there was none? Relax here completely for there are so many continuing sagas that have so much going on that one not only gets lost in them but if you let go entirely, you forget its being acted and directed out and have no trouble that this live history as it was and is. What greater entertainment is that? You will take a side of your choosing with the different actors and characters and learn to love and hate with them and one thing this movie dishes up well is suspense and not far behind is the second best thing they do which is to allow you to see those that have it coming get their comeuppance. In fact you cant wait but it comes in due time thus the viewer remains ready for the hook and that hook comes with satisfaction and closure. But wait, another injustice goes down and the whole tug on your emotions begins again. Well done to all actors in this movie. They wore their hearts on their sleeves and gave all they had making it extra-ordinary and exceptional. Notice too the beautiful horses of all colors and how well they perform awe natural. What they didn't spend in lavish backgrounds, thousands of extras and set pieces they more than made up for in story telling and allowing the viewer to travel along without effort. Highly recommend eating during some of these episodes as they eat meat, bread, feta cheese, porridge's, rich fresh milk and dried fruits. Have more than one snack standing by as well with a tasty drink. Great movie for sunflower seeds or pistachio nuts. Do you want to know what it was like back then and there? Start watching and prepare to be unprepared for this is not your casual viewing experience but a more intimate one. Added bonus? I learned a little Arabic and quite bit about early Islam and its practices. These people loved God and included him in everything. Humility abounds! Enjoy!"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,TV series about justice.,"Best TV series ever made, absolutely mind blowing I can't praise this enough, some great acting and a very long series but when 5 seasons have finished you will be yearning for more."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Sublime Ertugrul,"This series is a must watch. It has an excellent story, coupled with great performances and perfect cinematography. Entertaining from start to finish with an inspiring message of belief that good triumps over evil."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Legend.,"This is a story which removes the negative stereotype that is associated with Islam in current society, and shows the history of it's proud Ghazi and Beys. A story based on the father of the man who founded the Ottoman empire, created to give insight in the culturally diverse past often ignored. A tale which can be used to inspire many of all beliefs and learn the meaning of what it means to live."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Totally amazing series that pulled me in from the very first episode!,"First let me start by telling readers that I have never written a review for a movie or series. Second, let me say this... I'm a Texan all my life- lived in the country growing up - and the city during my adult life. I never knew much about Muslims or their faith, and to tell you the truth - I never cared to know. Third, I have never watched a foreign movie- and friends/family thought I was crazy for having to read everything that was said by each character. I don't even know how I ended up watching this except for one day I was board and starting looking at previews. I watched the preview and went straight to season 1, episode 1. Once it started ... I was hooked!!! I couldn't stop watching it. I watched it every chance I could get. That's all I thought about was trying to get home so I could watch the next episode. I binged watched most every night and sometimes it was filled with so much drama and excitement that I couldn't turn it off and go to sleep. The production, the sword fighting, the music, the drama was action packed every moment. The actors where unbelievably good! One thing that I can definitely say, if most Muslims are like the character and his family in this series- what a loving, caring, religion it is. It shocked me how much their religion played a part of their everyday life. Praying all the time, always trying to follow their religious convictions and ""their cause."" Everything about the series was just magnificent! From the script, to the characters, to the unbelievable music throughout- it was done by the best of the best! I learned so much about the history of these Turkish people and I know from reading and studying about the making of this series, that they had the best historians and professors that helped put all the information and historical facts together. It is fiction, but most of the history is true. They added story lines to make it like a drama. I almost cried when I realized that season 5 was the last season. I quickly googled to try and see if they would pick back up and continue a season 6 sometime soon. There was talk about doing it but nothing has transpired as of yet. However, the main characters (Ertugrul) youngest son Osman, was made out to be a world power as he got older. They had dreams about how great of a leader he would be and powerful. Apparently they have a spin off of this series which Osman ends up starting the Ottoman Empire as he grows older. It was mentioned that is was not on Netflix yet, but you could see it on YouTube. It was aired recently on Turkish television and was very popular with the viewers. So I googled it and read a lot of history on this leader. Just amazing. And this series is back in the time frame of the 1200- 1400's. Back when their was fierce fighting over land and tribes - as they migrated to find peaceful lands - which didn't seem to ever happen. Just amazing history, and amazing culture and religion. It really did open my eyes and I have a totally different view of this culture now- even though I'm Christian. Please please watch this series. I hope you will be hooked just like I was and continue to watch and learn. Just wish it wouldn't end! Season 5 has 88 episodes... I watched 81-87 last night and this morning and stopped. I just can't bring myself to watch the very last one right now. Lol."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,TGOT!!!,"Admittedly I was saddened when Game Of Thrones ended. The adrenaline rush was crazy! This show was recommended to me by Netflix. I figured I'd give it a shot. So glad I did!! This show is GREAT!! My Turkish Game Of Thrones!! I am hooked on the storylines and character development. It has it all...treachery, deceit, sword play!! But it also has hope, love and faith. I am emotionally involved!! I am happy when the characters are happy, and sad when they are sad....(It's made me cry!!) I am on season 2 and I know I will be extremely satisfied, emotionally exhausted and sad when it's over.... Love, love ...love."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,10. Could not pull away from the beginning!,"I have seen many series and movies but this was by far the greatest acting, fighting scenes, love stories and the love of their religion put me to shame with my own. I am more determined to speak to my God and let others see him through me! I am thrilled at seeing a Turkish film of their history and everyday life then and I am sure now. Thank you for producing this and thank you Netflix for airing this fine historical series. I hope to see more from Turkey and help me to understand and learn their culture."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Unecessarily long,"I liked the serie but the only problem that stopped me from watching it is its length. Season 2 is 100 episodes on netflix and full of unecessary scenes !! If the length was reduced it would be great, but most people wont watch it because of its length ."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Excellent,"I haven't watched the entire series yet but what I have seen so far is nothing short of excellent.

Brilliant acting and an intriguing storyline.

It is slow moving so I had to skip some scenes and sections but if you have ample time you could easily watch it all without getting bored."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Good Series About Turkish History,"A very good series about Turkish history. This series was a good production about Ottoman. It made several series on this subject, but none of them reflect reality. Previously there wasn't such series. It was a nice job for Turkey. Unfortunately we are behind other countries. I really take enjoy watching this series. A successful business. This series will come to a better place. I just want to mention one point. I especially love the battle scenes. But bloody scenes too fake. They should show a little more attention to detail. If you pay attention to them this will be a better series. A number of really useful for Turkey. I advise... 7/10"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,"Weird cinematography, mediocre plot","The cinematography was very weird. Almost looked like the whole thing was shot by some newbie student. I understand Turkish entertainment industry is still quite primitive but a show that is being pushed around by Prime Ministers should have some artistic edge to them. The plot at least from what I understand isn't quite complex. And most people who are watching this show are watching it for the religion, Islam, rather than the merits of its own. To a non-Muslim, this show offers nothing new. It's eulogizing a religion, mocking the Christ's Templars, and offers nothing new to the table."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Incredible,"The best series for anyone who wants to learn about the true, vast and gorgeous Islamic history."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Mustttttt watch,"Has there anything being made on television history better than this series ? The answer is No. by far I've never seen anything as beautifully directed, acted & produced than Ertugrul!! Can't stop talking about it. This drama can be easily compared with the top Hollywood series & still I'm sure the level of acting & class will be better than anything ever made. It's a must watch! Especially the fact that it's based on true incidents, just makes it more worthwhile to watch."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Best Show next to Game of Thrones,"Me and my wife really enjoy this show. It reminds us very much of Game of Thrones but without dragons. Good acting, great fighting scenes. The Story is addictive and told in a great way.

This is first Turkish series we have watched as we can not speak Turkish but was recommended to watch by a friend. We will definitely recommend it to others!"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Excellent Show with so much History,"My sons and I have been watching this show for a month now. We watch a couple of episodes a night. Being a Roman Catholic and also my love for history this show is excellent. No one was perfect, the Crusaders did was they thought was right, the Mongols and their dreams, but the Turks were fighting for their very existence and a land to settle. This show has everything and Hayme Ana looks so much like my late mother that at times I cannot hold back my tears. Enjoy this wonderful production."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,One the the best series i have ever seen,"Dirilis: Ertugrul is one the best TV shows I have ever seen if not the best. once you started you will not be able to stop watching it. I really liked the story line, the script and of course the actors chosen. Every episode is 2 hours, I know it a lot but you will not feel it because of the excitement of it. I highly recommend this TV show."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Halal Version Of Game Of Thrones,"This is a must watch... what makes this awesome is the fact that it promotes Unity, compassion, kindness, loyalty and overall a slap in the face of media that tempt to promote the religion of Islam as barbaric. After all it is all fact based on historical events and proves how good hearted Muslim and Christians worked together as one and together were also against terrorists."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,Completely blown away,"Watched the first episode purely by chance and betcame addicted to it. Even though Turkish isn't a language I can speak and understand, even faintly, the story line is exceptionally well written and easy to follow. The characters, the script, the acting are all superb - Bravo Team Ertugrul! On Netflix only seasons 1 & 2 are currently available, can't wait till season 3!!!! Keep at it guys - you're doing an exception job!!!"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,It's nothing special,"Do not deserve 1 star but don't deserve 7.9 rating either.. these ratings are mostly givern by people of pakistan and India who have only watched their saas bahu type trash serials..so it was awesome for them ..but after so much hype..when i watched it , it was nothing They showed the whole history different,5% facts and others are just made by themselves.. Moreover,action is just so dull...vfx , cgi is poor..acting is also just average.. storyline is just a little better and bigger version of Indian serials and oh yess..it has above 400 episodes..each of 1 hour..and it's not worth it"
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,authentic feeling,"This series thru Netflix is the longest series I've ever watched..im thru season 1 and into season 2. This is a very Authentic feeling series and the characters really ring true. It is an incredibly talented cast and the sets are lush and believable with no details lacking. Even with subtitles which are often comically misspelled with poor English the show progresses smoothly with surprises all the time. I think it is an excellent interpretation of the true Muslim spirit and portrays Muslim saints and followers with a more realistic feeling that could cut across religious lines and reach a western audience.. The story portrays a Muslim version of the events of the day which is not often found in western cultural history. There is very little CGI that doesn't look real. The bad persons are really bad and the good persons are really good! with some exceptions! The nomadic life of the early Turkish people is portrayed with astounding realism. It can get a bit soapy at times and they really take their time in unfolding the plot so i found my self skimming thru some sections especially in season 2 but even now im not doing that anymore as the plot is very rich with emotional details of the lives of the characters and it does tend to grip the viewer. Having now reached the end of series 2 I have a few more points of criticism as follows:: The subtitles are translations of the Turkish dialect and it is very uneven and looks to be the work of more than one or 2 persons. The translations make the characters appear at times very fanatical and hateful towards non muslims referring them as non muslims and thus deserving of death! This , I believe, to be a mistranslation of the word for atheist or one who does not believe in a higher power. The subtitle non Muslim only appeared a few times in series 2 and thus I believe it was mistake which was corrected later on in the series. I hope that series 3 will provide a better translation for the subtitles..I very much enjoyed the series and I still cant believed I binged watched a 178 episode series over a period of 6 weeks! I hope that there will be a series 3 but even if there isn't it was well worth watching."
Ricardo O'Farrill: Abrazo Genial,"It's definitely something different, looks beautiful, but has problems","NOTE: I feel obligated to mention, that I'm reviewing this show as _entertainment_, as a TV-show, and I'm not commenting on the actual history or characters of history that it portrays. I have little exposure or knowledge about those things so I will not attempt to bring them in. This is based purely on the show, and I regard it as such. I will make a few anecdotal comments about these, but it will be apparent when this is the case.

It's also pretty funny to witness the absolutely unhinged, weird behaviour of the arabic leaders (I think that's what they are, it's hard to tell since the subtitles I found are not perfect exactly). They are written in a even cornier way than the European characters, and it's absolutely ridiculous I have to say, the way they just do the dumbest things because they are evil, without profiting from it or anything, just plain murdering people and smiling orgasmically. But they are hilarious a good way, since I think it's intended to be a comedic relief from the otherwise cheesy, preaching and serious tone of the show. Also, you can not NOT laugh at some of the actors who play the crusaders being regular Turkish shade of tan, but have a hilarious, obviously fake bright blonde wigs, akin to the children's wigs you see in markets, on their head :D Not very convincing, but then again I sympathize that it can be harder to find naturally Scandinavian looking actors who can also speak Turkish. Though most of these background characters never say a word, so I don't know what that's all about.

I mean I'm into it. It's different, it looks visually beautiful, people act in an interesting way (other than the leading cast or the antagonists who are just cheesy) and the actors do a good job, especially in the supporting roles. I also think Turkish (I think that is the language they use?) sounds beautiful to me (a thing I would not have expected to say, having their current dictator's speeches as my only previous exposure to the language). I have to admit that I find a lot of the characters pleasing to the eye as well, especially the very lead character.

I don't necessarily like the cheesiness, and the constant praise of their god (which I understand can be a very accurate portrayal of the time period, so I'm not saying it's a bad thing on its own), but it's entertaining enough.

I suspect it gets better with each season, as shows tend to do, until the one breaking season that falls flat and brings the whole thing down. According to the ratings, this one doesn't seem to have that specific season, so I'm optimistically waiting for what's going to happen."

Blood of Zeus,"If you liked Castlevania, you'll probably like this","Animation is decent, as well as the story. It's not a masterpiece but its quite entertaining still."
Blood of Zeus,Great show!,"Really enjoyable and a great story. I started watching just to give it a try and ended up watching the 2 seasons in a short period. I liked the development of characters and how the story evolves in each episode.

It worth the time and the hype. Provides a different perspective of the mythology as a I never have seen it before. The episodes are relatively short they last between 28-35 mins each, so I could be watched in a weekend

If you just want to watch a fun, different and enjoyable anime this is the right one. I don't have high standards my last anime was ATLA and is the best TV show for me that have ever existed."
Blood of Zeus,Solid! Enjoyable,"If you're not a super critic like everyone else on here and watch anime for the enjoyment then you will enjoy this. It's fun, exciting, and has some pretty awesome characters.The animation isn't bad and the storyline gets you involved, it is by no means a masterpiece but who cares it's a netflix anime. enjoy it."
Blood of Zeus,Masterpiece,"As a Greek, I have to say that it is the best anime series I have seen in my life with Greek mythology, especially the second season is amazing, every episode held me like nothing and I didn't understand when it ended, I hope the third season when it comes out will be just as good, I really enjoyed it a lot. The words that touch your soul and make us think of each one of us individually are a very good touch, wonderful messages in each episode, well we are also talking about Greek mythology that you cannot compare with anything else in the world, all the world got something from this mythology and made their own or made religions, anyway congratulations to the creators."
Blood of Zeus,Not the most accurate take on Greek mythology but you'll love it!,"The series starts off slowly but somehow manages to hook you up and makes you feel wanting to know what happens next. I'll call this series a success just by this cause not a lot of shows or movies can hook you up from the very beginning.The series eventually gains it's pace and starts getting better and the final episode is a BLAST!The best part about this show I'd say is there's no unnecessary cliché moments in this,the story is always on point and is short.That's what makes Blood of Zeus a perfect binge watch.

P.S. as the title says it's not really mythologically accurate.The main protagonist Heron and his counterpart Seraphim and some other characters are made up.Its a different take on Greek mythology and Netflix actually admits it in the very beginning of its first episode.So,bottom line is if you ignore accuracy a little you are bound to love it!"
Blood of Zeus,Good enough IG. Watched because of Hades,"The best thing about this series was Hades ( and of course his queen persephone ) for me. The characterization of the main character was lame. I would prefer to see more of demeter. It's a good thing they didn't completely demonizing Demeter. She is the best mother in whole greek mythology. People had a problem with demonizing hades or demeter which none of this two deserved.

And I prefer instead of ares another god should harassing pers. Ares like hades and demeter didn't deserve being antagonist.

The story of H&P is a complicated religion story and people usually judged it easily and don't understand the contexts of it, so I'm happy we have a good show of them. ( even though they changed the details )"
Blood of Zeus,I want more!,"I am such a huge fan! The reasons I have such love for the show besides the obvious is finally we have a universe dedicated to the Greek gods done right! From true power showcases to beautiful scenes this show gets better and better.

Why we need more? There's so many gods we only have started to see if we get more seasons we can finally get epic scenes from amazing gods done correctly! My personal favourites are hestia from season 2!

Overall this series is a 10/10 perfect fighting sequences characters with such good style! And good world building this is a universe you will want to get in on!"
Blood of Zeus,Had potential!,Got me hooked after the first episode. A typical Netflix series - twists kept me hooked but the overall plot had too many gaping holes to make it truly entertaining. There are definitely better animation movies/series out there deserving your attention.
Blood of Zeus,Well done,Good approach with different story of the greek gods. Similar to castlevania style.
Blood of Zeus,By the Gods..!!,"The drama is juicy between the gods and mortals in Netflix's Blood of Zeus. Zeus shines as a fallible god, and the anime-inspired action is bloody and gruesome. The pacing can be a bit slow, but it picks up once it focuses on the gods. It may be not a great one, but it will keep you engaged till the end.

My Rating : 3.5/5"
Blood of Zeus,Amazing!,I have been waiting for an amazing Greek mythology adaption for years and years. At long last this show had finally arrived. I enjoyed both seasons and can't wait for the third to be released. The characters and the plot twists are fantastic and well thought out. The animation is gorgeous and the vibrant colors really bring the fighting scenes to life. I'm excited to see the characters grow and develop over the next few seasons. I also just wanted to give kudos for the Greek producers who are making their people proud by representing their heritage through this show! Do yourselves a favor and watch this series because everything about it was adored by a Greek mythology nerd like myself.
Blood of Zeus,Cliché,"Blood of Zeus, like so many modern adaptations of Greek Mythology, is a disappointment. Characters are two dimentional and shallow, story is boring and way too stereotypical. You won't find anything groundbreaking or satisfying about Blood of Zeus, especially if you are familiar with the mythology."
Blood of Zeus,Great if you're only watching it in the background,"The animation seems to be both a big problem for some reviewers and a favorite part of others and I think that has a lot to do with fantastic and beautiful backgrounds contrasted with animation that feels unpolished/rushed at times. So someone watching this show passively while doing something else would glance up occasionally and see the beautiful backgrounds with a powerful score and think that it was epic, while someone actively giving it their attention would notice the flaws in the animation and see the score as not always fitting to the less than epic scenes being presented.

The story, like the animation, also felt rushed, but at the same time felt overly inflated with nothing (like long scenes of people walking) like it was rushing from story point to story point but lingering at each point for usually no real substantial reason. The characters themselves felt underdeveloped, which made most of their relationships feel very shallow, forced and seemingly out of nowhere (this mostly applies to the nongod characters as Zeus and Hera's relationship was the only one that felt fleshed out in any way). I think total there are, arguably, 4 main characters and 4+ supporting characters which seems like way too many to develop properly in 8 30minute episodes filled with a lot that didn't seem to develop anyone.

Overall, it was a story that suffered because of how it was broken up and divided between what felt like pointless characters because of lack of development. I think this story could have been told better if it had been cut down into a 2h movie length, a two part ""limited series"" or given more time per episode to develop fewer characters in a way that moves the story forward at the same time."
Blood of Zeus,Plot and main character are flawed but the gods and villains are very well done and worth the watch,The main character is a bit of a Gary stu but the portrayal of the Olympian gods and the twists/additions to the mythology are refreshing. Highly recommend to those who enjoy Greek mythology
Blood of Zeus,Very enjoyable,"I watched this in a couple days had a blast, will definitely be returning for season 2 of which I have high hopes for the same quality. I also really like the animation style."
Blood of Zeus,Just OK.,"Animation is good. Story is not intriguing at all. Creators doesn't put much effort in writing dialogues for a Mythological story, hence dialogues are flat. Don't watch if you are Japanese anime lover, it will surely ruin your mood. Other can try watching it, nothing special though. High rating only suggests that this is not rated by frequent anime viewers."
Blood of Zeus,"The show could have used more time to flesh out characters more, but otherwise a very enjoyable experience","As stated in the title, I felt like some characters definitely need more development. The pacing felt uneven sometimes, with some unclear character motivation. Those are the main flaws.

The animation is beautiful, and the score is amazing. The story, while incoherent at times, are in no shortage of epic moments. The main character - Heron, is a bit too generic and felt overshadowed by the supporting casts at times. The Greek Gods, while details might be different than their mythological counterparts, are still basically true to their main characteristics. Overall, the story is full of potential for seasons ahead, and I personally cannot wait what they will do with the story in the next seasons."
Blood of Zeus,I think i like it,I hope it will continue Might be a little longer It was nice to watching It wasn't waste of time
Blood of Zeus,Amazing,"If you like any type of mythology this needs to be your choice. One of the best animated series that i have watch. Incredible animations ,story and even the dialogues are amazing. It isn't the typical animated series because it contains a lot of violence so if yo don't like blood, war and some other sensitive things this isn't for you. The story is very original because doesn't take other previous ( Like Heracles or Perseus) stories to make the principal story, it obvious appears gods, titans and creatures that complement the trama. I really enjoyed watching this series and i hope you can enjoy too."
Blood of Zeus,Worth a watch if you enjoy Greek Mythology,"I was really excited to watch this when I heard it was animated by the same studio that animated Castlevania and I recently finished playing an awesome game called Hades that's all about Greek mythology as well so this was right up my alley.

It was a decent watch but you'd have to really love Greek mythology to give it anything above a 7. The animation was the biggest let down given how amazing Castelvania looked. I'm not sure what changed at the studio with this project but the action scenes were choppy with a few too many cuts to hide poor animation. It's not terrible by any means and there are some really cool moments it's just hard not to compare it to the earlier work the studio did that I was so impressed with.

On the positive side the dark atmosphere is very fitting for Greek mythology and once the gods become more involved in the story it gets pretty interesting if not a little cliche. But, It is Greek Mythology so that's expected. I'd say it's worth watching but nowhere near as amazing as some people are making it out to be."
Blood of Zeus,Watched 2 Seasons now awaiting 3 more,"As per review available online this series has total 5 seasons and these 2 has really kept me on the seat to watch these 2 seasons. Regardless of the adult theme, the producers have kept it clean and entertaining. Frankly, last episode of the season 2 is gripping and I hope to watch season 3 this year. 9 rating for this flick will be the first for me. I will advise to watch this Flix further than episode 1 as those episodes are always not easy to digest and never tend to explain the whole show. Never expected that Netflix can produce such a clean and good series for it's viewers a good story.."
Blood of Zeus,Good to watch,Comentario no disponible
Blood of Zeus,"Not sure how this is getting such high ratings, it's very half-assed","It's not the worst thing on Netflix, but it looks and feels very obviously low budget. I saw reviews say this was the best animation on netflix?? Hello? Avatar? The dragon prince? A million other things? The style is cool, but the animation looks more like a flipbook towards the end of the season (did they run out of money?). There's not enough dialogue and voice-acting is just okay. The animation isn't good enough to watch it attentively and the dialogue is lacking so you completely miss out on the story if you missed the key frames. I can't comment on the story too much, because it didn't hold my attention. Lots of pointless conflict and lack of adequate communication between characters."
Blood of Zeus,last episode was a cliffhanger..excited for season 3,Comentario no disponible
Blood of Zeus,Great series,"Absolutely love this series. The animation is on point and leaves you wanting more. The action is very tense in a good way. The announcement at the end of the last episode has me praying for a 3rd season. I will boycott if there isn't a season 3. The characters are really engaging. The story line is great because with each character you find yourself being able to relate. From the sad, love, and forgiveness. We all can relate. So it will suck you into that character till you see what they do to be evil and vengeful. So at that point you are like you suck for doing that. It is absolutely a must watch for something that is totally different."
Carmen Sandiego,Such an amazing first season,"When I first found out about this series, I thought it was a kiddie/girl series. But That was definently not what it is. Love the Graphics Style, character designs and overall tone of the series. I will gladly recommend this series to my closest friends. U developers deserve some praise. Hope session 2 is gonna be this amazing also."
Carmen Sandiego,"Good and also for older ""kids""","Show is definitely bing worthy and also fun for adults. Can't wait for season 2 (Netflix ordered 20 episodes, so 11 more to come)."
Carmen Sandiego,One of the best reboots I've seen!,"Like most, I was a little skeptical when I saw that they were rebooting Where On Earth is Carmen Sandiego. With the animation I was sure it would be a flop. But it isn't! I'm so glad that they made tweaks here and there and that it is a breath of fresh air. I see this as a prequel of the TV series in the 90's because of all that has happened in 10 episodes. I think it does deserve some work because all of the men are dumb and crave food while the women are smart and on point. While I do support gender equality, I feel like they should make at least SOME of the male protagonists/antagonists better. The design is flawless and I love the new music for the theme song. Overall, I love it and I hope they make a season 2!"
Carmen Sandiego,This turned out to be my jam,"2d animations have always had a special place in my heart, and this show makes me remember all the cool cartoons I used to watch when I was little and all the nostalgia I gained through 2d animation's amazing joy. The animation is stylized and fun to watch, a few things can be improved like walking animations and ease in ease out frames. Characters have variety and are enjoyable, their development is also done very nicely. Carmen's transition from a tomboy to a feminine badass fighter is really great and stunning to watch, although I think they still could do the transition better, the show shows that as a person, Carmen did become strong in many ways. As the main character, Carmen also does not lose her mysterious style to the watcher and to her rivals. I finished it in one day and now I am craving for more as the story does not lose it's interest it implements on to the viewer. So in short, you should get watching, you won't regret it."
Carmen Sandiego,What a wonderful surprise!,"Like many on here have said, I was skeptical of this re-do, but the team behind Carmen Sandiego really nailed it! My seven-year-old daughter loves Carmen, and we're currently on our third round watching the series. I was a little unsure as the first episode opens, but I like where they took the story, and the motivations they gave Carmen to excel. The animation style is modern and crisp, and the voice acting is great. Well done, another great entry from Netflix!"
Carmen Sandiego,Good possibly on the verge of something great,"As someone who enjoys Spy thievery espionage type stuff like James bond, sly I found Carmen Sandiego quite enjoyable, I feel like it could be a big hit because it's very high quality and well produced. The music is excellent and the opening is incredible. Carmen is a really likable protagonist, Player is cool, and the action is well choreographed, and at the end of the season the mystery and cliff hangers make you want more. however what holds the show back is i'm not quite sure what demographic it's trying to reach it constantly shifts from wanting to be some what mature to doing something more in line for a regular kids show would do. Its really weird after the becoming Carmen sandiego episodes the first 4 or so episodes are a lot more ""kiddie"" while the more mature story lines of the back 3 episodes of the season seem more mature. I personally think the more mature episodes fit the show better but that my opinion. I also really don't like Zack or Ivy they just don't seem to fit the tone of the show, and come across as annoying comic relief that I dont think the show really needs; however luckily there characters were reduced a lot in the back half of the season so that's was good. Which is probably why the back half of the season was better. So my verdict is It's a really good start with glimpses of greatness and in the future I hope the show continues on the more mature route because I think that's where it shines, and either Ditch Zack and Ivy or write them to be better characters because there honestly just annoying comic relief"
Carmen Sandiego,Very good,"It's like a blend of Kim Possible and Leverage, can't wait for season 2"
Carmen Sandiego,Competently done without being brilliant,"The 2D animation is stylized and looks fine. The story and characters are done competently but without brilliance. It will entertain kids. It doesn't have much to offer for adults, but it's watchable without offending the spectator's intelligence. It chooses to show off its modern sensitivity in a heavy-handed way, by making the male characters actively stupid (or, in one case, competent but passive) and all the female characters hypercompetent and kick-ass."
Carmen Sandiego,Overall satisfying but it could do with a few less stereotypes,"As a former geography major in college and someone who grew up on the computer game, the game show AND the cartoon, I was especially excited about this show and it largely lives up to billing.

It has a fair more effective backstory and it's hard to deny that rewriting Carmen as an anti-hero keeps things fresh. The geographic lessons aren't as strong as the animated series with much of it consigned to when Carmen switches locations.

Unfortunately the series will teach your kid about the broadest of stereotypes. Why the Japanese instructor hasn't been called out by anyone for his Chinglish or why Gray (AKA Crackle) is acceptable as a walking bundle of Australian clichés, is beyond me. And don't get me started on Ivy and Zach (holdovers from the animated series) who are from Boston and are worse than Jimmy Fallon and Rachel Dratch's characters on SNL.

The animation is geometric like a computer game and has a unique vibe.

One problem that often plagues serials is that the good guy always wins at the end. Even adult-oriented procedurals like ""Monk"" had the good guy winning in the end, whereas better shows like ""Burn Notice"" and ""The Good Wife"" teased out serial plots with the protagonist hitting peaks and valleys. This is just a kid's show but it ingraining it with a bit more sophistication would do wonders."
Carmen Sandiego,Refreshing new approach on a belowed 90s show,"The new 'Carmen Sandiego' is absolutely binge-worthy. I just watched the entire first season in one go. I think it was a very good decision to make it rather a prequel instead of a remake. This way, fans of the old show (like me) get thrilles when old characters show up before they became what they were in the 90s show. I especially loved a certain cameo scene in an elevator, but no spoilers here. Talking of characters, all of them are well-written and interesting. I love how they have managed to include 'The Player"". This brings me to my only point of criticism though: The gender equality is way off balance on this show, and it takes a lot for me to notice such a thing. Apart from The Player, all male characters are dull and clumsy, while all leaders on the show are women, and all women are agile and smart. This was just a bit too much even for me. I hope season two manages to balance this out a bit better - and I hope we won't have to wait too long for the show to continue because season 1 was great fun!"
Carmen Sandiego,First 2 episodes r good then the 2 sidekicks r introduced!,So I really like the start of this show it's a pretty good back story a way to set up some good advasaries along the way and The actress doing Carmen's voice is a golden globe winner for Jane the virgin and u have probably seen her in other things but she is actually a really good character actor so she knows how to transform! She will also be playing Carmen in a live action version! This show is NO TrollHunters but it made me feel good while I was watching it then u have the Finn from stranger things talking to her in her head piece and they should of stopped there! But instead they decided to bring in two stupid brother and sister duo the guy isn't as bad! But good lord the sisters voice is like a screech in my ear and it's like they gave her every bad line they had and she spits them out in this terrible accent that I don't even know where it's from! S2 if they get it they neeed to get rid of these two idiots because all they do is screw things up! When Carmen has always been a loner! They should just bring in a different side character that she meets every other episode or so and move it around like that! Have some reacure! Maybe a kinda live interest in there! But no they put two stupid twins in there that mess everything up! And it brings the intelligence of this show down! Our kids are not stupid they r getting smarter and smarter they don't need constant physical gags to make them happy! I do like how this show introduces different things about the country they are visiting it's a great way to teach kids and adults who r watching! I'm giving this show a 6 if they got rid of the twins it would be a 9!
Carmen Sandiego,Educational & important; for all ages,"I remember loving this show as a kid. And the game! Loving the new series as an adult. Im reminded of how much more I knew about the world as a child. Offers a great opportunity to teach youngsters about the world; geography, trade, culture and tradition, climate, species etc."
Carmen Sandiego,Nice animation but holes in the plot.,"The animation is nice on the eyes, the characters and voice acting are good but the writing is often too simple and full of holes (though does start to improve after season 2). Simple writing shouldn't have plot holes. This show has potential if it can tell a better story but it is improving."
Carmen Sandiego,"Show of global ""stuff"" that's too American","Just a couple of questions;
why are all (except for the guest stars) Good Guys Americans?
why are all the Bad Guys non-Americans (except for 1 person)
and the bumbling detective is French?"
Carmen Sandiego,Really great,Comentario no disponible
Carmen Sandiego,International Young Woman of Mystery,"A femme fatale/complex heroine from Buenos Aires, international travel, action and suspense - what's not to like? Not surprisingly, it's a slightly bigger hit with Sienna (as compared to, say, Avatar, which the kiddos seem to enjoy equally); but we all love the Boston sidekicks and their accent. I vaguely remember the computer game from the 80s (did I play it on my Apple IIe?), but there doesn't seem to be any resemblance.

First watched - 2019-2020. Update: season 4 watched 2021, Seb didn't like that she temporarily worked for VILE, but it all worked out at the end of the season!"
Carmen Sandiego,Good fun for adults and kids alike,"My 8 year old and I love this. Strong female characters, strong male characters, great writing; it's funny, action packed, and with great ethics and morals without ramming it down your throat or being preachy.

Can't wait for the next series!"
Carmen Sandiego,Something for kids and adults,"My kids (8 and 5) and I love the show. It's fun, educational, and gives a great example of a strong female character who does the right thing. Sad that there are only 10 episodes in the season."
Carmen Sandiego,"Potential to be great, but sexist much?","Carmen Sandiego, the lady in red, has the morality of Robin Hood and the thief skills to match. There'a no doubt she'll be the femme Fatale that inspires young girls to be the best they can be. This is the kind of show that everyone can enjoy...if you are female.

This series is more than just an action series, but also educational. It teaches children about cultures around the world and gives a 2-3 minute educational breakdown of what someone can expect if they were to travel to various locations throughout the world. But, it also teaches children to feed into stereotypes and think boys are stupid.

The two main male characters, the agent tracking Carmen down and Zack (the brother of the sibling duo that assists Carmen), are as dumb as a box of rocks. And it's not even subtle. The producers believe that the best way to shine the spotlight on women and empower them is through the degradation of their male counterparts. The ""boy genius"", a carbon copy of the tech genius from Kim Possible, is only heard and rarely seen. If uplifting a demographic happens at the expense of another - it isn't perpetuating equality. It's just a shift of dynamics via revenge mentality.

If you can get past the sexist mentality that girls are inherently smarter and more ""mature"" than their male counterparts, this is an otherwise great show. Even if it is simply a reboot of Kim Possible in every way possible."
Carmen Sandiego,Great for my daughter and me to watch together,This was ver entertaining. My 7 year old and I just happen to see this come across while searching Netflix. She and I thought this looked interesting and we were right. We both loved it and wound up binge watching it in one (rainy)day. There was fighting and action but not violent and no bad language. We can't wait for season 2.
Carmen Sandiego,Its Okay,"Its not the best show i have ever seen, buts it a great reboot. Its kinda slow too."
Carmen Sandiego,Please continue this collection,"I can only say that it was great and I wish it continued and did not end in Season 4. By watching this collection, you can show important parts of the history of different countries of the world to children and even adults, and this is wonderful."
Carmen Sandiego,Target Audience,"For what it is it's good, but I was hoping the target audience would be a little older. My kids like it though, to kiddie for me."

Attack on Titan,AOT: The Greatest Anime I've Ever Seen,"Attack On Titan is officially over. And nothing will ever be the same.

When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.

In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.

Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.

And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.

The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.

This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT."
Attack on Titan,Masterpiece. I've never witnessed this level of care for every detail.,"The moment you watch this audiovisual masterpiece you will immediately appreciate the level of thought and detail that went into this. From the initial scene that shows you the main and unique weapons to some of the frames that could literally be used as your desktop background or be hanged in your room as paintings. From episode to episode you'll think that you won't be surprised anymore and you'll be wrong again and again, every time I thought an episode or season couldn't be better I was proven wrong. You will get goos bumps from dialog alone and you will lose your mind in the epic fight scenes The characters and their development, the story covered in mystery that unveils beautifully, a dialog carefully written that shows the characters personalities and wisdom., sound design, music, illumination... you'll feel like you are there. The voicing of the characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way."
Attack on Titan,Nearly perfect,"Before I started watching this show, I couldn't imagine why it is rated so high. After I finished the first season, I understood. And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!

Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.

The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.

Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!"
Attack on Titan,My experience as a 42yrs. Old....,"Growing up in the 80's 90's during the time of top anime stories and always getting into arguments with my friends and my son that those were the golden anime era and now I have to admit. This is if not the best story telling I witness in all my years. This show raise the bars with each episode, with unpredictable twist and turns you won't see coming. After completing season 4 mid season finally I must say I'm happy to be alive witnessing a master peace in the making. Can't wait for the finally!"
Attack on Titan,Well deserved to be alongside other greatest TV series ever created,"I'm a more frequent American TV shows watcher than Anime watcher. I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.

Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.

I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and cliché is the same as saying GoT is predictable too 😊.

The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.

All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate."
Attack on Titan,Greatest Anime,"Review By Kamal K

Story 10/10

It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.

Animation 10/10

As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10. Animation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.

Sound 10/10

I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.

Characters 10/10

What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters. This season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her ""Christa Lenz"" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a ""gambler"". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her ""I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl"". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).

Enjoyment 10/10

I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.

Overall 10/10"
Attack on Titan,Shinzou wo sasageyo! Devote your heart!,"I'm not an expert of anime. I haven't even read the manga, which I'll do it btw. But I can assure you that attack on titan will keep you interested from the very beginning thanks to a gripping and original plot. There isn't a single boring episode, it's always suspance and action. It may seem a superficial fantasy anime but it actually deals with important topics, such as freedom. Furthermore, the soundtracks are so good that you will start feeling patriotism for an imaginary country."
Attack on Titan,A historic anime,"Incredible, I honestly have to say that this could be the best anime ever due to its development and plot. Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.

Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touch

The first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10

The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10

The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10

Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.

In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10. Sincerely from my point of view, the best anime ever, a work of art from post-apocalyptic fiction."
Attack on Titan,Amazing Anime,"This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them."
Attack on Titan,Legendary show.,Comentario no disponible
Attack on Titan,Just perfect,"Perfect from every prospective story,music, sound track, art and animation. This is not an ordinary anime it's a masterpiece."
Attack on Titan,One of the best ever,"Season 4 is halfway through already, and I have gone back once again to re-watch the previous seasons, and it truly is a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review as 9 minutes into that episode had me crying again.

I have been watching AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season, and it's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened"", and all that...

For a time my top 3 running shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings slowly fizzled out in quality after its fourth season, yet Attack on Titan has held strong and not only remained brilliant, but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.

I still to this day listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to pinpoint anything bad about it really. And I know some people will say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show also, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3, but when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the macro, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived or dramatized at the time, make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.

Anyway, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is so intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional and tear-inducing.

If you liked the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is indeed for you.

Now to slowly endure the agonising anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...

P.S. - a good companion documentary to this is Dominion (2018)"
Attack on Titan,"Season 4, what can we expect?","A lot of people have this question, can season 4 beat season 3 part 2? And the answer is yes! Isn't full of action, is like a combination of all the seasons, great plot, the best charachter development in all the serie, great action, and a lot of plot twist. October 2020, please I need you right now!"
Attack on Titan,Give your hearts !,Attack On Titan makes it hard for me to enjoy watching other Animes 😂
Attack on Titan,1 episode left..,"Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.

In AOT, you dont have to support the ""good"" against the ""evil"", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.

The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.

After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.

One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world."
Attack on Titan,Genuinely the greatest show I have ever seen,"*NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW*

I can't put into words the emotions I felt when watching this show over the course of two months. It honestly completely took over my entire life and personality, and it was all I could think about...

There's never been a show with as many plot twists as this, as deep of emotional connections to the characters through the screen as this, or written greatness as this.

But know that every single detail should not go unnoticed. Every single word that the characters say. EVERYTHING is foreshadowing, and the circular storytelling is revolutionary like no other.

Hands down, this is the most incredible show with incredible characters, storytelling, and attention to detail. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this story."
Attack on Titan,The Greatest Animanga of all Time,"Attack on Titan is the king of world building and plot. With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The Music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece of our generation and my favorite TV Show of all time."
Attack on Titan,I wish there was a reply button for some of the reviews here! Anything less than a 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece is stupid,"Some of the people have rated this show a 1 out of 10. And I understand why. The Plot is so well written, you won't even know the real storyline until season 3 or whatever. On the outside it seems a pretty simple story. Demons vs humans. Who will win? That is hardly the story at all... and even thinking that, I watched through the first 2 seasons. And even then I was hooked because of great story building and great great climaxes and actions and all. I thought season 1 ending was insane. Then season 2 came. I thought It was even crazier. Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling. You will thank me when you reach the season 3 finale, GUARANTEED!"
Attack on Titan,If I could rate this 100 I would.,Never have I been one to seek out Anime but this show was recommended to me very heavily multiple times. I eventually caved and watched the first episode. I was then sucked into the most intense binge watch I've ever experienced. It is on second to Band of Brothers in my personal favorite shows. I have no words to truly describe how incredible this show is. I wish I could go back in time and watch it for the first time again. This show had almost ruined all other tv shows for me because I know they will never even come close to being as perfect as this show. The characters and story line are impeccable.
Attack on Titan,Easily my favorite anime,"The entire storyline is constantly expanding with unexpected twists and turns. Seeing where the show started and where it ends up, you wouldn't even believe it's the same storyline. There are hundreds of hints and forshadowing that let you discover hidden things about characters and civilization before it is ever said. Everything is so fleshed out too. It is an intense, soul crushing, inspirational, fantastic show with some of the best animated moments with dynamic camera shots, dynamic movement, amazing fight choreography and beautifully written characters. This is my favorite show of all time, each time I rewatch it I learn something new, hidden in the storyline. Couldn't recommend enough."
Attack on Titan,Disappointing in the Best Way,"Season 1: 7/10

This is probably the best the show ever was, despite all the anime-isms that make parts of it hard to take seriously. It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.

Season 2: 6/10

This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.

Season 3: 5/10

I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.

Season 4: 6/10

This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.

Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch."
Attack on Titan,Amazing!!!!,"So good, I'm waiting the next season , and also a very good SGI and what a wonderful story , I don't know how to i'm gonna wait until next season"
Attack on Titan,Still recovering,Comentario no disponible
Attack on Titan,My god,"This series is really ahead of its time, its brilliant and its definitely the best tv show ive ever watched in my life. The fact that it has an imdb of 8.8 is a disgrace, it deserves way better than that especially after the glorious season 3 part 2. This anime is way better than rick and morty, way better than even game of thrones, but the ppl in charge of imdb give it a way lower ratings than those two?......balls. This anime deserves a lot more respect."
Attack on Titan,Master of Storytelling,"I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.

The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.

It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.

Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!

Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.

I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.

EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE: It's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!"
Care Bears and Cousins,AOT: The Greatest Anime I've Ever Seen,"Attack On Titan is officially over. And nothing will ever be the same.

When I finished Breaking Bad back in 2019 prior to ever watching anime, if someone told me an anime would be on the same playing field as Breaking Bad and even exceed it at times, I would've told them they were crazy. But in reality, I was the crazy one. This story took me places mentally and emotionally I didn't think I could go.

In this dark and cruel world created by Hajime Isayama, while some things are objectively wrong, there's never a moment where you can definitively say that someone's the good guy or bad guy. Once you see the full picture of the show, it's indescribable to explain the show in the manner of good and bad considering how much everyone's in this dark abyss of a gray area that has no objective answer to whom is in the right or wrong. And that's the beauty of AOT.

Attack On Titan is not meant to be joyous. It's a tragedy. It's an unfair world where everyone at some point is given a dirty hand whether they deserve it or not, and the characters have to try and live with that reality and keep moving forward. Now that doesn't mean that there aren't moments where you as a viewer can feel joyous for your perspective favorite character/side because there likely will be, but when you're no longer told the story through this small microscope, you won't be able to see the show the same.

And that's where the absurd genius of the creator Hajime Isayama comes into play. As much as I love the Vince Gilligan's of the world, David Chase, Peter Gould, Jesse Armstrong, David Simon and honestly any writer of any piece of fiction... no one comes close to the creativity that this man has. Isayama is able to create this large world in these small walls surrounded by humanoid creatures that live to destroy and ruin the human race. But as you continue to watch the show, it's like you're peeling an endless onion that doesn't stop, and constantly makes your eyes water and tear up due to the brutality and the absurdity that this universe subjects you to. It will boggle your mind then tear you to shreds in ways that I've never seen before.

The plot twists are second to none. The heartbreak will shatter you to pieces. The betrayals will leave you speechless. The world building will make everything before seem small. And the clashes of different ideals will leave you wondering how you could even pick a side. I could go on all day but to put it simply, the unique story in itself is what brings this all together. And that's not even mentioning things like the voice acting, music, animation, esc. Which are all top tier.

This isn't an anime. This isn't a TV show. This is a fictional masterpiece. And I'm honored and blessed to say that I got to live to see the day where I'd witness the end of it. Thank you, Hajime Isayama. And see you later, AOT."

The voicing of the characters is excellent... there is nothing below excellent in this. An absolute masterpiece and a bar of quality for any audio visual product to come. Be prepared to care only about Attack on Titan and nothing else, because nothing else will make you feel this way."
Care Bears and Cousins,Nearly perfect,"Before I started watching this show, I couldn't imagine why it is rated so high. After I finished the first season, I understood. And now, having watched the third season I don't understand, why it isn't rated even higher!

Truly a masterpiece, and deserves to be mentioned on the same page as other fantasy war epics like Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones. (I dare to say this is even better than those two.) There are countless twist and turns, shocking revelations and heartbreaking moments troughout the series, spiced with great voice acting, beautiful visuals and on top of all: a more than perfect, stunning soundtrack, thanks to Hiroyuki Sawano.

The story is brilliantly written, and does not slow down, not even for a bit. It keeps growing bigger and bigger, while you will find yourself tied to your chair, as you can't watch only one or two episodes. Behind the plot and the action, there is also deeper meaning about war, humanity and questions about moral dilemmas.

Toughtprovoking, exciting and most of all a masterpiece of our time!"
Care Bears and Cousins,My experience as a 42yrs. Old....,"Growing up in the 80's 90's during the time of top anime stories and always getting into arguments with my friends and my son that those were the golden anime era and now I have to admit. This is if not the best story telling I witness in all my years. This show raise the bars with each episode, with unpredictable twist and turns you won't see coming. After completing season 4 mid season finally I must say I'm happy to be alive witnessing a master peace in the making. Can't wait for the finally!"
Care Bears and Cousins,Well deserved to be alongside other greatest TV series ever created,"I'm a more frequent American TV shows watcher than Anime watcher. I have been watching multiple great TV shows in the past 10 years: Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Lost, Westworld, The Boys, Dark, House of Cards, Sherlock etc. - just to name a few. Attack on Titan caught my attention one day after I checked the top 250 TV shows on IMDB and saw multiple 10/10 featured reviews from other people, especially considering that it's an anime that is ranked very high on the list.

Hence, I came to AoT with high expectation and after watching it, I'm surprised that it only gets a 9/10. This show is definitely not inferior to Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, though I understand that being an animated, foreign show means that it has to try much harder to prove its worth.

I find AoT to be almost perfect, and I don't think it's realistic to expect any shows to be perfect. After all, these pieces of arts are all created by human being and we are imperfect! What other reviewers said about AoT is absolutely true: AoT has incredible storytelling, world building, plot twist, foreshadowing, character development and excellent soundtracks. On top of that, I trust the hype also comes from the fact that this show builds such a strongly immersive world for viewers where one can feel being part of its world and understanding the characters' motives and actions. This exerts a strong impact on our feelings and the theme itself is so thought-provoking, which is not something a lot of shows could do. And trust me, I believe I watched enough good series and movies so as not to be easily impressed. On a side note, I don't find the lowest ratings for AoT justified, but rather superficial. Among the lowest reviews I've seen so far on IMDB, none has truly given a critical analysis of why the show is objectively bad - it's either coming from pure haters, those who are too impatient to watch the story in full or those who just don't want to understand the series because of existing bias. Also, any comments saying that AoT is predictable and cliché is the same as saying GoT is predictable too 😊.

The show keeps getting better and better after each season with lots of jaw-dropping twists. As such, I do respect its consistently high quality after 10 years since its first episode and after seeing multiple great TV series starting off well and had degrading quality after a few seasons. There is only 1 episode left and the show so far has only raised the bar after each episode. I know about the ending through the manga and I find it absolutely satisfying. It's considered to be a controversial ending where the fandom is splitted. But I think that's the beauty of this series - it's more real than a live-action show and it correctly depicts the actual world. There is no boundary of good or bad, right or wrong - it's all about perspective.

All in all, a phenomenal journey that I'm utterly grateful to embark on. An absolute 10/10 for this masterpiece - a pity that 10 is all there is to rate."
Care Bears and Cousins,Greatest Anime,"Review By Kamal K

Story 10/10

It continunes few days after where we left off last season and it focuses more on political drama and dilemmas inside the walls. This season gets straight to the point and introduces new villain named Kenny that turns out to be somehow related to Levi. There are many parties trying to get Eren and Historia. For what reason? It is yet to be reveald. Mystery we all feel in love with is still there and there are even more questions, but don't let that distract you from the fact that this season ,even tho is only few episodes in, already has some major reveals in it. Pacing is amazing and i wasn't bored for a moment while watching. Things are only getting more interesting when Erwin reveals how he's planning to ovethrow the governmant without using the force. This season has a very refreshing and different plot compared to previous ones as we can see from the lack of titans and focuse on the issues inside the walls rather than beyond. However it's still as, if not more interesting than before. There is world buidling,mystery,back stabbing and some major questions answered which there is hopfully more to come.

Animation 10/10

As we can see characters in this season look a little bit different or older which some might not like but i do personally. It's a fresh change. They look closer to their manga designes. Some might notice that they removed those thick black lines around characters faces which made AOT art stand out even more. Don't get me wrong, it still does but that was something that was missing which kept me from giving it 10/10. Animation is brilliant for this season (it's Attack on Titan after all :D) and like every season it only got better. . Perfect combination between 3D background and 2D animation along with masterfull camera movement made this scene look like a movie. There is even one frame where levi is facing the wall and you can see his reflection in the window. Just goes to show how much detail and time was put in to this scene. After i done some research i found out that it took the animator of this scene 1 whole month to complete it. Just that one scene alone. All props to Arifumi Imai. Great job. Hopfully it keeps this quality because this season is said to be 24 episodes long.

Sound 10/10

I mean, is there anything to say? AoT is notorious for it's amazing OST and sound quality. Voice actors are great as always and the sound that stand out to me the most was the sound of falling shell from kenny on the roof in ep.1. It was just so satisfying :D. And again mad props to Hiroyuki Sawano (the composer) for the epic and emotional music.

Characters 10/10

What i like about AoT characters is the fact that they interact so naturally and nothing from their conversation seems forced which is immediately showcased in the very first scene in ep. 1. That cabin scene where jean and eren argue,sasha tries to steal bread, mikasa still does work even tho she's injured and armin cares for her deeply. And of course Levi the clean freak comes in at the end :p They are such fun and lively characters. This season already had some major development for our cast. We got to see Erwin's and Hisotira's backstories which also delved deeper in their characters motives. Both backstories were heartbreaking and made me care a lot more for them. Hisotira is slowly taking of her ""Christa Lenz"" facade (is that how you say it? lol) and Erwin is proving again and again why everyone loves him and would follow him to death. His childhood story is very similar to how our society and governmant wokrs today which is very scary. And we all need to remember that isayama is criticizing this type of government and society with these topics. Instead of just walking of Erwin comes back to Dimo Rivees's wife and comforts her saying he'll avange him. Erwin is charismatic,great leader, intellignet and someone that you just want to follow. Since the young age he was corious and as he call himself a ""gambler"". He is someone that would give everything for the humanity. Or is he? I think there is a lot more to his character. Hange got some development too. Eren is maturing and seems a lot more chill this season but unfortunately he is kiddnaped again :( Poor guy he just can't catch a break. In ep.1 he helps historia to overcome here pain and shows again just how honest he is by telling her ""I like you more this way, just a stupidly normal honest girl"". Also hugeee development for armin. To think that he would be capable of killing a human.. this will deffinitely have a huge impact on his character in the future. The way he selfreflects and his philosohpical speach about morals is great, it really makes you think. He kinda has a point too. He shows one more time how mentally strong he is even tho he lacks physicial strength. This time is just on another level. Now lets talk about our new villain. KENYYYYYYYYYYY. I love this guy lol. The way he roasts and insults levi and the cowboy vibe he gives. I love it. He immediately showcases that he is not a joke by blowing nifa's head off just like that. He also seems very mysterious. The way he treats levi is almost as if he looks down upon him. Speaking of Levi here is what i think: That chase scene where he's running away from kenny is not just a great action sequence it also represents Levi running from his past. Kenny=His past. Running from kenny or his past. This arc is also big development and challange for him now that he has to act as a leader/commander because erwin is absent or busy. There was also some smaller developments for connie (motivating himself to take on the beast titan),jean (struggling to remain human which almost costs him life, also selfreflecting), sanes (showing how he didn't want to do the things that he has done and over the time he just got used to it, also he was kinda easy to symphatise with too and his devotion to king is may be morally wrong but aslo admirable, the way he feels destroyed after finding out that he was actually the one that betrayed the king is also worth mentioning), flegel (stepping up becoming a boss saying how he'll protect the people of his city), zachary (showcasing that he cares more about himself rather than humanity and how he always hated the governmant because they looked up on everyone).

Enjoyment 10/10

I never enjoyed AoT more. It's great.This season has perfect balance between story telling, character development and action.

Overall 10/10"
Care Bears and Cousins,Shinzou wo sasageyo! Devote your heart!,"I'm not an expert of anime. I haven't even read the manga, which I'll do it btw. But I can assure you that attack on titan will keep you interested from the very beginning thanks to a gripping and original plot. There isn't a single boring episode, it's always suspance and action. It may seem a superficial fantasy anime but it actually deals with important topics, such as freedom. Furthermore, the soundtracks are so good that you will start feeling patriotism for an imaginary country."
Care Bears and Cousins,A historic anime,"Incredible, I honestly have to say that this could be the best anime ever due to its development and plot. Shingeki No Kyojin has one of the best character developments and plot in history (note that this series does not have fill), he even the secondary and third characters have a great importance in the story, but also has that sense of terror, action and drama that by the way is incredibly well done, makes you live the situation that the characters go through and transmit their emotions to you in a very human way. It has an excellent background story that is simply memorable.

Every decision they make is of minor importance to the series and should not be missed, their deaths and the surprise of knowing who are the real antagonists add a magical touch

The first season has a slight start, it ends up being a spectacular season, it is not the best but it is an amazing season with an incredible animation and plot, here you will be introduced to the first antagonist of the series. 9.4/10

The second season I think was epic, this is when you start to see the faces of the real villains (get ready for Senshi Tmp 2 Ep 6 which according to me is the best of the second season, an overwhelming chapter) Shingeki no Kyojin explains it to you perfectly without leaving gaps in the plot, an incredible season. 9.6/10

The third season is truly phenomenal, has a good start and lets you know the problems you will have in a society by not agreeing with something or the difficult decisions you must make to ensure your survival. After this, too many things are clarified without detours, the chapters that stood out most were Perfect Game (Tmp 3, Ep 16), Hero (Tmp 3, Ep 17), Midnight Sun (Tmp 3, Ep 18) and That Day (Tmp 3, Ep 20) (That day has no action or features our main characters, but this chapter amazes me, its development is spectacular and the way they explain everything is overwhelming, honestly, the best development chapter in the history of anime). 9.8/10

Season four is the start of the finale. A season practically perfect, in this season everything comes to light answering every question of the viewer, leaves no gaps in the plot and has a beautiful animation, besides that is incredibly shocking and demonstrates the incredible development in our protagonists, Eren has the best character development I think. For me the best chapters were in my opinion Declaration of War (Tmp 4, Ep 5) (Declaration of War is one of the most impactful chapters of development), The War Hammer Titan (Tmp 4, Ep 6), Assault (Tmp 4, Ep 7), Assassin's Bullet (Tmp 4, Ep 7) (Assassin's Bullet left me speechless...) and Above and Below (Tmp 4, Ep 16), has not yet finished this season, but still for me it is spectacular. 9.9/ 10 This season is the best.

In my opinion your average would be 9.3/10. Sincerely from my point of view, the best anime ever, a work of art from post-apocalyptic fiction."
Care Bears and Cousins,Amazing Anime,"This anime is simply amazing! The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime. One of the best so far. As it has only 9 episodes as of now ... many critics say that it is way too early to rate an anime. But, according to me, this is pure class. The soundtrack's tempo varies according to the situation and this makes it more exciting. The ending of the episode is something that NO one will look forward to as NO one will want it to end. A must watch for every anime lover and of course the manga is available as well. Although a bit gory, the epicness makes up for it! You know those animes that catch your eye from the first episode, this is one of them."
Care Bears and Cousins,Legendary show.,Comentario no disponible
Care Bears and Cousins,Just perfect,"Perfect from every prospective story,music, sound track, art and animation. This is not an ordinary anime it's a masterpiece."
Care Bears and Cousins,One of the best ever,"Season 4 is halfway through already, and I have gone back once again to re-watch the previous seasons, and it truly is a masterpiece on all levels. I had to pause S1E06 just now to write this review as 9 minutes into that episode had me crying again.

I have been watching AoT since 2013, eagerly awaiting each new episode and season, and it's hard to believe the series is ending very soon. ""Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened"", and all that...

For a time my top 3 running shows were GoT, Vikings, and AoT. Sadly, GoT collapsed before the finish line, Vikings slowly fizzled out in quality after its fourth season, yet Attack on Titan has held strong and not only remained brilliant, but actually improved in many ways as the show progressed, which is incredibly rare.

I still to this day listen to the amazing soundtrack while doing other things, and each time I return to watching the show, it's hard to pinpoint anything bad about it really. And I know some people will say that AoT is overrated, and I might have thought that at some points in the show also, such as at various points in Season 2 and 3, but when you see how it all connects together and makes overall sense in the macro, some seemingly weaker aspects or things that appear nonsensical, overly contrived or dramatized at the time, make sense upon revisiting it, or at least that was my experience.

Anyway, I would give Attack on Titan a 10/10 simply because it is so intensely watchable, engaging, inspiring, epic, thought-provoking, anti-war, spine-chilling, horrifying at times, emotional and tear-inducing.

If you liked the early seasons of Game of Thrones, Vikings, Breaking Bad, Fullmetal Alchemist, and other similar shows, then Attack on Titan is indeed for you.

Now to slowly endure the agonising anticipation for each new and final episode of the last season...

P.S. - a good companion documentary to this is Dominion (2018)"
Care Bears and Cousins,"Season 4, what can we expect?","A lot of people have this question, can season 4 beat season 3 part 2? And the answer is yes! Isn't full of action, is like a combination of all the seasons, great plot, the best charachter development in all the serie, great action, and a lot of plot twist. October 2020, please I need you right now!"
Care Bears and Cousins,Give your hearts !,Attack On Titan makes it hard for me to enjoy watching other Animes 😂
Care Bears and Cousins,1 episode left..,"Ive been watching this show since 2016, and I wanted to write a review for it but I couldn't because with every new episode i have a mixed feelings and i can't determine where am i from this show. But now, with only 1 episode left, i can finally write whats in my heart.

In AOT, you dont have to support the ""good"" against the ""evil"", because simply there's no such thing in this world. Usually, an any work whether if its a movie, tv show or an anime, there's sides and you as a viewer have the choice to support whatever you like good or bad. Most people choose the good side, some choose the bad one. This type of work represents almost 75% of all the works out there. So some of us have adjusted to the idea of good and bad sides.

The other 25% are shows, movies and animes like AOT, they are psychologically complexed with a lot of twists and most importantly no good or bad sides. These kind of animes describes the world and our reality in such a scary truthful way, it mixes your emotions and feelings and you dont know what to think, makes you consider a thousand time before calling a character good or bad, this is AOT.

After completing most of the show i can say, that AOT reached a high level of realism. That you dont have to determine in which side are you.

One advice for anyone who hasn't saw AOT or is still in the beginning, dont take sides, just enjoy the anime because I believe its the best anime in the world."
Care Bears and Cousins,Genuinely the greatest show I have ever seen,"*NO SPOILERS IN MY REVIEW*

I can't put into words the emotions I felt when watching this show over the course of two months. It honestly completely took over my entire life and personality, and it was all I could think about...

There's never been a show with as many plot twists as this, as deep of emotional connections to the characters through the screen as this, or written greatness as this.

But know that every single detail should not go unnoticed. Every single word that the characters say. EVERYTHING is foreshadowing, and the circular storytelling is revolutionary like no other.

Hands down, this is the most incredible show with incredible characters, storytelling, and attention to detail. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this story."
Care Bears and Cousins,The Greatest Animanga of all Time,"Attack on Titan is the king of world building and plot. With ultra realistic consequences missing from a lot of animation, Attack on Titan stands out as it has an incredibly dark world with actually stakes. The aspects of horror and adrenaline when there's an action scene is stellar. The characters, action and music could carry episodes but don't have to because the show is already that good. Characters have depth and feel like real people, they die constantly and never feel 100% safe. The action is some of the best action in any show. Mystery aspects make even moments that could come off as bland feel so much more impactful. This is perhaps one of the best stories ever written. The Music makes this epic world feel vast and important, while also sounding phenomenal. Attack on Titan is a masterpiece of our generation and my favorite TV Show of all time."
Care Bears and Cousins,I wish there was a reply button for some of the reviews here! Anything less than a 9 out of 10 for this masterpiece is stupid,"Some of the people have rated this show a 1 out of 10. And I understand why. The Plot is so well written, you won't even know the real storyline until season 3 or whatever. On the outside it seems a pretty simple story. Demons vs humans. Who will win? That is hardly the story at all... and even thinking that, I watched through the first 2 seasons. And even then I was hooked because of great story building and great great climaxes and actions and all. I thought season 1 ending was insane. Then season 2 came. I thought It was even crazier. Then season 3! A literal masterpiece... specially the second arc. and the 4th season is expected to be God Level. And I expect nothing less from the greatest anime of all time. That's how good the story is! It's complex yes. Greatest Plot I have ever seen on a show. I love breaking bad, I love Avatar the last air-bender, I love Game of thrones. But The story line, music, and the voice acting are all 10/10 easily. Do yourself a favor, don't judge it by it's cover, get through some quality anime till you reach God level story telling. You will thank me when you reach the season 3 finale, GUARANTEED!"
Care Bears and Cousins,If I could rate this 100 I would.,Never have I been one to seek out Anime but this show was recommended to me very heavily multiple times. I eventually caved and watched the first episode. I was then sucked into the most intense binge watch I've ever experienced. It is on second to Band of Brothers in my personal favorite shows. I have no words to truly describe how incredible this show is. I wish I could go back in time and watch it for the first time again. This show had almost ruined all other tv shows for me because I know they will never even come close to being as perfect as this show. The characters and story line are impeccable.
Care Bears and Cousins,Easily my favorite anime,"The entire storyline is constantly expanding with unexpected twists and turns. Seeing where the show started and where it ends up, you wouldn't even believe it's the same storyline. There are hundreds of hints and forshadowing that let you discover hidden things about characters and civilization before it is ever said. Everything is so fleshed out too. It is an intense, soul crushing, inspirational, fantastic show with some of the best animated moments with dynamic camera shots, dynamic movement, amazing fight choreography and beautifully written characters. This is my favorite show of all time, each time I rewatch it I learn something new, hidden in the storyline. Couldn't recommend enough."
Care Bears and Cousins,Disappointing in the Best Way,"Season 1: 7/10

This is probably the best the show ever was, despite all the anime-isms that make parts of it hard to take seriously. It's exciting, it's mysterious, and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone.

Season 2: 6/10

This season is fine, it strays from the first season's tone a bit more than I'd like and it's full of conversations between major characters that the audience has zero context for, making this is a frustrating season to watch. On top of that, what should've been one of the show's biggest reveals is extremely downplayed to the detriment of the season.

Season 3: 5/10

I'm very mixed about this season. It's divided into two distinct arcs, the first of which is awful and the second of which is nearly the same level of quality as the first season. The structure and pacing of the first arc is terrible, the villains are bland and either not fleshed out at all or too late for the audience to care. The second arc of this season, however, is exciting and much more important to the overall narrative of the show. It still fails to perfectly recapture the tone of season one, but it's very good. The first arc is a 3/10 and the second if a 7/10, so rating-wise I took the average.

Season 4: 6/10

This season was difficult to get through for me, not because it was bad but because it was so different, There was so much information, and there were so many new characters and conflicts. It was a lot, but I think in the end it mostly worked. Not every new character or plot thread mattered in the grand scheme of things, while others mattered a lot and significantly impacted the narrative. The animation style was also very different this season and unfortunately it was to the show's detriment.

Overall, I like this show a lot, but it has some significant problems. My biggest complaint was that the tone was set perfectly in season one, then largely abandoned for the rest of the series. Despite this, the show is exciting, the music and animation is (mostly) great, and the characters are well-realized and fun to watch."
Care Bears and Cousins,Amazing!!!!,"So good, I'm waiting the next season , and also a very good SGI and what a wonderful story , I don't know how to i'm gonna wait until next season"
Care Bears and Cousins,Still recovering,Comentario no disponible
Care Bears and Cousins,My god,"This series is really ahead of its time, its brilliant and its definitely the best tv show ive ever watched in my life. The fact that it has an imdb of 8.8 is a disgrace, it deserves way better than that especially after the glorious season 3 part 2. This anime is way better than rick and morty, way better than even game of thrones, but the ppl in charge of imdb give it a way lower ratings than those two?......balls. This anime deserves a lot more respect."
Care Bears and Cousins,Master of Storytelling,"I am not the regular anime fan, I've seen some really good ones but Attack on Titan sits on a whole other level of amazing writing.

The way the story unfolds is so well written and engaging, that I was hooked since the first season where the plot seemed to be a very basic revenge story between humans stuck living inside mysterious walls and their nemesis, humanoid titans which seems to exist with the sole purpose of eating humans alive.

It's hard to make a detailed review without giving up on spoilers, I've shared the premises, but Attack on Titan is so much more than that... From the parallelisms with the real world depicting themes like war, greed, complacency, the inherit curiosity for exploration all the way to the grey characters and their respective development, I can only say good things about this anime.

Ambiguity is an ever present concept in our lives, and this show depicts it like very few do, this associated with how brilliant the characters evolve throughout all 4 seasons its remarkable, you can empathize with someone that made the most awful things and that shows how brilliant the creator is.

Adding to all the above, you will be facing many mind blowing twists and unexpected dark turns on the story, with one of the best animation work I've ever seen on screen, specially the most recent episodes - considering this started almost 10 years ago!

Outstanding soundtrack, I get the chills on many of the fight scenes and of course it goes without saying that the fights themselves are brilliant, nerve wracking and make you so hyped with all of the elements of the action combined, really a one of a kind TV show.

I am eagerly waiting for the final part next year I don't know if it wraps up badly but up until this point it's a flawless masterpiece and I don't say that lightly.

EDIT AFTER SERIES FINALE: It's quite the challenge to say the least to end a series like this one, after having watched the final episode I can safely reinforce how much of a masterpiece this anime is.... The message in the end transcends entertainment, it's a timeless lesson and it is scary how close to reality it is. It's almost impossible to get into detail without writing a full script so I'll leave it at this; this is one of the best TV shows ever created, don't take my word for it go binge it now that it wrapped up!"
Kota Factory,"They never disappoint, do they?","I know i might be exaggerating a bit or i might I be over-reacting a bit .. But this is getting out of hand..

Series after series they are producing gems which we as human beings can only just applaud to.. Starting from pitchers, permanent roommates,tripling, yeh meri Family, immature and then KOTA FACTORY.. I know everyone is telling that tvf is trying to give stiff competition to amazon & netflix but i think it's vice versa.. Amazon & netflix are trying to give stiff competition to tvf....They may not have the resources to show mammoth battles or big fat Indian weddings but they certainly have the writing prowess to make you cry, laugh,be sad, happy,nostalgic all at the same time."

Kota Factory,A black and white gem which shines the brightest,"It's not hard to make a tv series especially on a topic that you have lived... It's like making or writing your own stories so it was not hard for tvf guys because they have lived the life themselves. But, it is not a web series like other. It is a study of the situation and not simply presenting the situation. How we feel, why we feel it, how does it impact our behaviour voluntarily or involuntary. Everything has a meaning including the black and white scheme of the series... Which describes a rather colourless and one dimensional life of a student who has been living with blinders. The while series is a study of all this behaviour.

Thank you from bottom of my heart..."
Kota Factory,Amazing.The Best Series from TVF yet.,"Whenever anybody would blame about the lack of quality content in India (I include myself too), they are given subtle reminders in the form of some of the most amazing shows. The irony to the same and complain about content, however, is the fact that there is a barrage of shows and films that either go unnoticed or just don't click with many viewers.

TVF (The Viral Fever) is one of the flag-bearers of making the digital scenario the massive juggernaut it is today. Responsible for Pitchers and Permanent Roommates, the channel has now presented another show in the form of Kota Factory."

Kota factory uncovers most of the problems faced by these students right from the politics behind admissions, placement of batches, living conditions, study materials, quality of teachers, internal politics of the coaching centres, Marketing techniques, teaching methods, freedom, campus fleecing, friendships, student lifestyle and tons of other problems faced by these poor kids.

Acting of Jitendra Kumar as jeethu Bhaiya a swashbuckling teacher was outstanding. Most of student's acting were natural and good. The show is shot in black & white, which adds a contour on the dull lives of the students. Direction, editing and cinematography were decent and Songs were top notch. Shooting in the real location has really helped the outlook of the show. A chemistry rant by the lead, Vibhav in episode 3 was simply outstanding.

The web series is a much watch for all the Lakhs of students and ex-students who studied in the hundreds of coaching centres in Kota and elsewhere. But it must be duly noted that all work and no play will make students dull and sorry to say that the students of Kota look dull. In my opinion, for a perusal of a better life, a lot of the parents don't hesitate to destroy their kid's lives. The failure and rejection would be too much for the young kids to handle. I wish the makers had brought this up too instead of marketing the Unacademy app in the series."
Kota Factory,Masterpiece to junk,"Season 1 was the best part of this series. Season 2 just disappoints you in every manner (except Jittu Bhayia). As it went from TVF to Netflix, it looks like it's motive went from education and life experience to lust. Almost every supporting character looses their arc and didn't really hold relevance in the story. They directed that this unhealthy competition is not be problem but your lack of determination, nad only and only your problem."
Kota Factory,Bollywood needs to learn from this,"Unique idea of black and white cinematography along with brilliant direction deserves nothing less than 10 stars. This is more than struggles faced in the quest for success. This is something that everyone watch and different things can be learned from it. With a well aligned story this series offers us entertainment as well as education. Wonderful actors like Jitendra add wonders to the already well written script. Bollywood and senile directors like Karan Johar, Ekta Kapoor come and watch this offer us something better."
Kota Factory,It's the little things that matter!,"Being a Kota Factory produce myself, I had my share of doubts before the starting the series. Doesn't matter what the final result is, Kota days remain a mix bag of good and bad memories.

Thankfully, I made the right choice. Kota factory is very well researched and captures not only the obvious but also the little things that are intrinsic to Kota life. The salty water, obsession for patties, reading English literature while being bored just to ensure your time is optimally utilised - all make the show very real and relatable.

The director also walks the thin line of optimism and pessimism around Kota gracefully. While the show reflects the positives of Kota, it also portrays the perils it entails for a student, ensuring the reality is not misrepresented. The monologues of Jitu Sir are lucid, pertinent, and are well received."
Kota Factory,Inspirational vibes all over from first episode.,"Jeetu rocks as always. Apart from acting of main character, everything is awesome. Reality is shown in best possible way and TVF knows how to play its cards right. May be my personal favourite, I can tell by watching the first episode, after pitchers."
Kota Factory,A brilliant piece,This show encapsulates the entirety of the student struggle and the zeal of being praised upon. We live in a system that only rewards students who are good at regurgitate unoriginal information. These intricate stuff would cascade into being a complete introverted isolated individual. Love the cinematography and the writing!
Kota Factory,"Surreal TVF, Back again.","This show hits you at the right spot, even though i never allowed myself to be consumed by these coaching notions, I always felt bad for these Average low confidence socially isolated classmates who came as a failure from Kota."
Kota Factory,Second Season Nahhh!!!!,"First season was great but the second one finds its hard to even be called a GOOD.

The second season was just the result of Netflix buying the show. Being an IIT Aspirant myself I find it very relatable but the second season did not work for me."
Kota Factory,"S1 is great, but S2 is on a whole other level","The first season was mostly about showing students how about balance school life while teaching you life lessons, and it does that very well.

But Season 2 takes all of that and improves in every way - the direction, story, characters, the change in tone and the dialogue."
Kota Factory,Best series,Best indian series ever created . It's shows the real struggle of an Indian students
Kota Factory,An Excellent Social Drama / 7 Stars,"An excellent take on the competitive world of post-school education and coaching in India, Kota Factory nails every single aspect of being a 10th passout looking to enter an IIT. But what makes the 5-episode mini series a worthwhile watch is not the description of the life of such a student but the the freshness and partial didactic approach that aims to educate the viewer about the real goal. A must-watch for both students and parents. TN.

(Watched for free on YouTube.)"
Kota Factory,"In simple words: Overhyped, directionless with a weak story.","I have watched this show with high expectations and I'm just down with both the seasons. The screenplay, cinematography, acting is a solid 8 on 10. However, I still find (and very honestly) this show to be overly trying to be ""cater to all"" issues in 10 episodes.

The show starts with a very sincere attempt on what goes on in Kota coaching classes. I've been through all of this and I could relate to the first couple of episodes. However, from 3rd episode onwards, I found the characters unreal. Almost every character (be it, shivangi, jeetu or our main guy) is shown to be a very opinionated, full of wisdom and extremely confident in their demeanor and life choices. This is far (extremely far) from how reality of Kota going students is. This is where this show astrays from this core storyline. Things like, students in live-in relationship with loved ones, students going and roaming around Kota blowing off steam, all very casual, free, inter-gender talk around highly societal taboo issues like mensuration, masturbation and in general long term life advice seems extremely unnatural from students of 11th and 12th. And I'm not even including the fact that these students have from here for IIT coaching and as such students who do go to Kota and get admissions in few top institutes there have literally no time to pursue any hedonistic pleasures and their love interests. This is where characters lose their integrity and authenticity and they look forced and completely fictional.

In summary Kota factory (TVF) is trying very very hard to cover as many societal issues as they can in 1 story. And in doing so they have created characters and storylines which seem unreal and unconnected."
Kota Factory,Jeetendra Kumar And Mayur More Shine In This Must-Watch Sequel About IITians' Challenges !!!,"The second instalment picks up from where its debut season had left off, with Vaibhav Pandey (Mayur More) switching from Prodigy Coaching Class to Maheshwari Coaching Class, as the latter is a better institution when it comes to IIT coaching. The story revolves around Vaibhav's, his friends', and classmates' mental anguish as they prepare for the IIT entrance exams. Will they give up or will they triumph in the most important struggle of their lives ?

Created by Saurabh Khanna and Arunabh Kumar and written by Abhishek Yadav, 'Kota Factory' is set in the ultra-competitive student ecosystem of Rajasthan's Kota, a place where vulnerability and trauma abound for students preparing for the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT). This sequel, too, is one-of-a-kind, thanks to its spot-on humour and relatable existential struggle experienced by the protagonist.

The first season of 'Kota Factory' follows Vaibhav Pandey, a teenager who enrolls in a coaching institute that prepares students for the IIT entrance exam. His friends and competitors, Balmukund aka Meena (Ranjan Raj) and Uday (Alam Khan), gradually assist him in adjusting to this high level of academic pressure. However, near the end of the season, Vaibhav clears Maheshwari's admission entrance exam and is torn between his heart and mind about whether or not to enroll in the best coaching center in town, which has a high success rate. The second season, on the other hand, picks up right where the first had left off, chronicling the protagonist's trials and tribulations, particularly after he has to adjust to a new learning culture in Maheshwari after leaving his friends and love interest Vartika (Revathi Pillai) behind. Will he be able to persist in the face of such adversity, or will he succumb to the pressure? That is the question that the creators are attempting to answer.

Directed by Raghav Subbu, this five-part 'black and white' series highlights the issues that IIT-JEE aspirants face in their day-to-day lives. It gets viewers emotionally invested in the students' journey and the guidance of their one and only physics teacher, Jeetu Bhaiya (Jeetendra Kumar), who serves as a modern-day Dronacharya for them. The narrative eloquently depicts a wide range of emotions, including optimism, angst, love, companionship, and even doubting one's own life choices-whether they truly want to follow the course that appears to be carved out for them, or if they can forge their own path. Briefly, the narrative does emphasise the importance of family support as well as the difficulties faced by youngsters who are unable to cope with the competitive pressure. However, the creators should have paid a little more attention to the delicate aspect of students contemplating quitting in order to give the plot a larger perspective.

Overall, the series stands out by providing high-octane emotional scenarios that are complemented by a well-crafted background score. Additionally, meaningful songs like Amit Trivedi's 'Main Lad Lunga' provide depth to the character's emotional agony. Without being too dark to watch, the close-up shots convey a sense of the claustrophobic environment as seen through the eyes of students.

Similar to the previous season, Jitendra Kumar plays a pivotal role in the show. As teacher, mentor and supervisor, Jeetu Bhaiya is the only one who understands the students' problems and encourages them to confront them. Even his motivational talks, such as ""don't dream, always aim; since dreams are imagined and aims are to be achieved,"" leave an impression.

Mayur More plays Vaibhav to perfection. His character is primarily shown overcoming the challenges of fierce competition, which is exacerbated by his own shortcomings. Mayur shares great on-screen chemistry with his friends Meena and Uday, who are played by Ranjan Raj and Alam Khan, respectively. While everyone's performances are consistent, Raj's character, Meena, steals the show once again, especially when he is dealing with his adolescent hormones. His innocent one-liners infuse the show with the required humour.

Ahsaas Channa, as the medical student Shivangi Ranawat, has a significant role in this season, assisting and serving as a support system for the group of students. Vartika, played by Revathi Pillai, has a minor role, but her on-screen chemistry with Vaibhav is endearing enough for audiences to remember.

Like its predecessor, this season of 'Kota Factory' perfectly captures the students' vulnerability while also highlighting the burgeoning coaching industry, which views its students' victories as a marketing campaign for their institutes. Overall, the production is highly motivating, with a compelling story and outstanding performances that make this satire a must-watch."
Kota Factory,"Parents could be wrong, but their intention can never be wrong","I was in the middle of binge-watching all the web series on TVF Play when this came (I prefer calling shows like this web series and the ones on Netflix and Prime TV-shows). I was trying my best to finish Pitchers so that I could move on to this. I had seen too many memes and saw all my friends sharing the stories on WhatsApp about them watching the last episode. So finally when I got the chance to watch this, I did it immediately. Kota Factory is probably the best web series that TVF has made so far, and that's saying something provided Yeh Meri Family also exists.

Kota Factory is a story set in Kota, where a number of students come every year to study for JEE Advanced. Everyone comes over there only with the hopes that they are going to become an IITian one day. As someone who also wanted to visit this city during my 11th class, I can very well understand what it feels like to be there. In the scene where Vaibhav is caught cheating from a book and Jeetu Bhaiya scolds him, I actually felt it right through my heart. I got an AIR 173 and got to DTU, so you can understand how much I had to struggle to get where I am, and hearing the things he said reminded me of my own days at the coaching centre.

There are so many things that feel really relatable in this web series. The way Vaibhav adjusts to the PG life, the entire character of Meena, the teachers at the coaching centre and how they try to look as enthusiastic as possible to keep the students engaged; it's all just like how we get to see people in 11th and 12th class. My school was one of the biggest schools of India, so students from all over the country used to come to study with us. When I look at Meena and Uday, it reminds me of them; the two kinds of students that used to be there.

The only problem I had with this series is how it was made in black and white. There's no problem with making a black and white show, but in this series they just slapped a greyscale filter on this. There was no contrast, the camera quality was very bad and the certain areas that need to be given special application for greyscale effect was not done at all (if you've watched Logan: Noir or Zack Snyder's Justice League: Justice is Gray you'll know exactly what I'm talking about).

Kota Factory is a social commentary that belongs to something I like to call the 'era-defining entertainment', something that people from the future can watch to understand what life was like in our times, and the fact that we actually wanted to change them. I use this term to define films and shows like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha, Zootopia, Watchmen etc. I really appreciate the fact that TVF Play is a free streaming service, so this masterpiece will be available to everyone without having to spend money."

Outer Banks,All the drama is driven by stupidity,"I like this show, but it can be very frustrating to watch at times. The acting is decent, but as many others have already pointed out, the casting is a bit ridiculous. The lead actor, who is playing a 16 year old, is nearly 30. He doesn't look even remotely like a 16 year old. All the actors playing teenagers are far too old for the roles they have been cast to play and it ruins the immersion for me somewhat. Is it really so hard to find decent actors that at least look the age of the part they are playing?

But that's hardly the main issue. The story at a high level is good, but the details is where this show falls apart. All of the drama and tension is created by characters doing stupid things. The stupidity ranges from mild, to unbelievably dense, but that's always what is driving the drama. It's hard to find characters likeable when they continuously do stupid things and never learn or grow.

And it's not just the teenagers that are stupid. None of the cops follow procedure, because if they did the story wouldn't happen. Whenever a character does something clever, it has to be ruined by someone doing something incredibly stupid, because again, then the story wouldn't happen. I wish the writers would spend a bit more time trying to come up with different ways to push the story forward, maybe by having the antagonists be clever, rather than the heroes being stupid.

I've finished season 2 now, and I don't regret watching it. It's good enough, but it could have been a lot better."
Outer Banks,"Entertaining, if you don't take it too seriously","After seeing several seasons of Outer Banks I cannot deny that I was amused and entertained: all episodes are chock-full of high paced adventures, treasure-hunting and pursuits by villains, all this on exotic locations and with as an extra some romantic entanglements between the young and attractive cast. So what's there not to like!?

Well, I do have some reservations too. The goings-on are all extremely farfetched and unrealistic: like how this group of teen-friends succeeds time and again in escaping right under de nose of the police or heavily armed criminals, frequently amidst a shower of bullets but always unharmed; or how they solve mind-boggling mysteries (like for ages hidden treasures or the location of the legendary El Dorado) within the flick of a wrist, or thanks to out-of-the-blue strokes of luck.

The young cast is evidently supposed to illustrate the importance of true friendship, but their juvenile behavior gradually gets on your nerves, with all the bro'ing and dude'ing and the unavoidable reversed baseball caps. And silly nick-names of course, like JJ and Pope and John B (what's the B for anyway?). They all look good, but the acting is just adequate, only Drew Starkey really stands out as the troubled Rafe, and Rudy Pankow was pretty convincing as the resourceful, ADHD-fuelled JJ.

In fact it's more a series for teens, hardly exceeding the realms of The Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew. Maybe, as a reasonably grown-up person, I shouldn't watch this at all, but hey, sometimes it's nice to go with an easy and enjoyable flow without too much thinking. If there's yet another season in the making, I bet I will not be able to resist it. Again."
Outer Banks,Scooby Doo revisited,"This series has teenage kids, in a van, solving mysteries in a swampy, spooky landscape. The boys are handsome, the girls are cute. The only thing missing is a dog."
Outer Banks,"Utterly unrealistic, but VERY enjoyable nontheless","This show is ridiculously unrealistic, but tbh I don't even care. It's obvious that it's not supposed to be the most serious show ever, so I'm totally fine with it being completely over the top.

The main actors are very easy on they eyes, and are doing a pretty decent job with their acting (nothing outstanding of course).

The actors are way too old for the roles they are playing, until Sarah said she was only 16, I wasn't really sure what age they were supposed to be. But whatever, that's nothing new. Casting of age approproate actors is super hard, so I can't deduct any points for that really.

I am not completely finished yet, but so far it's fun, fast paces, enjoyable.

Edit: After finishing the show I CAN'T WAIT for season 2. It got SO much better with each episode, and honestly, at the end this felt like a really high quality production, and it's a really good setup for a potential second season. What impressed me the most is how well the dialogie was written, it was really believable. If you can ignore the fact that they don't look like 16 at all, they definitely act like a bunch of stupid 16 year olds. Netflix, you've done it again!"
Outer Banks,Worth Watching!,"I wasn't really sure what to expect from Outer Banks as I originally thought it was a show aimed just for teens but I couldn't of been more wrong. It's a show where people of all ages can enjoy it. It's about a teenager and his three best friends who hunt for a legendary hidden treasure after his father's disappearance. It takes a while to get going but once it does it doesn't slow down. There's something about this show that makes it feel authentic. It's a well enough written show where it will keep you following along and having a good time doing it. It has the perfect blend of comedy, drama, mystery, etc to keep you entertained. I really did enjoy it much more than I thought I would. If you're looking to turn off your mind and just enjoy a fun show...this is it!"
Outer Banks,"As an old person, surprisingly I liked it","Watched with my 12yo and went in thinking I would rather put toothpicks in my eyeballs, BUT it was actually good. And I appreciated the care they took with issues of consent for a teen show."
Outer Banks,Pretty Decent,"If Into The Blue had a baby with The O.C. and that baby had an affair with the baby of the Goonies and National Treasure, this is your type of show. I really couldn't care less about kid acting, the story is fun and always had my attention. Another season would be great!"
Outer Banks,Entertaining BUT irritating,"Enjoyed the storyline, was kept entertained for both seasons. Couldn't stop watching it. But man oh man, are the characters stupid and irritating. At some point, I thought I couldn't finish the show due to their stupidity."
Outer Banks,Quarantine Suprise,"Like you, I've been holed up binge watching Nexflix and Prime. I've watched everything under the sun. This had just come out on Netflix and I started watching it. I never stopped. It is a fun and enjoyable show. The casting is extraordinary...every actor hits it out of the park. The story moves along at an engaging pace to the end, yet looking back, every episode could stand as a one off...on it's own. It's a remarkable accomplishment and kudos to the writers. It's hard to categorize the genre. It's rated m, but no nudity or gore. I see no reason why a 13 year old couldn't watch it. It's funny, has many mini adventures, many misadventures, romance, shipwrecks, storms, fires, gunshots, keggers, jail, boys save girls, girls save boys, parents are devil's, parents are angel's, treasure maps ...and the show has fun doing all of it. Perfect for a quarantine."
Outer Banks,"Very Frustrating, But I Binged in Two Days",Comentario no disponible
Outer Banks,Glad I gave it a chance,"I have to say that I ended up enjoying Outer Banks a lot more than I thought I would. It's by no means one of my favorite shows I've ever seen but it's definitely worth watching. The only reason I started watching this is because I was bored and heard mostly good things about it so I thought why not? I'm glad I did because I ended up binging through it pretty quick. It's a tense, suspense filled series that will hold your attention throughout the series. Most of it is unbelievable but that's part of the fun of the show. I do have to warn you that this last season (S4) is not very good. The only reason I got through it is because I was already so invested in the show but it was disappointing. The show is coming to an end with Season 5 so let's all hope it gets back to the quality of the first couple of seasons."
Outer Banks,"Entertainment 10, storyline 1.","Maybe the most annoying and frustrating series I've ever watched. The ridiculous and stupid storyline has plot hole after plot hole. At the end of the day, the main characters make it sufferable and it's worth binging if you've got the time, but this might be the most grotesque example of lazy writing that I've ever witnessed."
Outer Banks,"Almost really good, but ruined by stupidity","I remember the first season as being a generally fun, rich kids vs. Poor kids, teen drama/adventure/treasure hunt. The biggest downsides were the overly old cast and quite a few cringe-worthy situations and choices. Like a lot of ""teen"" shows, it would have been better cast with actual teens (or just have them be in college instead of high school), but it seems typical to cast 27 year old guys as 17 year olds in grade 11 these days.

Unfortunately the second season ramps up the stupidity to comical levels. It is literally the definition of a ""comedy of errors"": an event or series of events made ridiculous by the number of errors that were made throughout. Middle schoolers will still like it, as will people who can completely turn off their brains (or have none to begin with). Really basic things like travelling times and distances, the weight of $500 million in gold, and recovery time after surgery to repair a gunshot wound to the gut, plus the incredible number of stupid things the main characters do, make it beyond frustrating to watch. I'll finish it because the overarching treasure hunting plot is kind of fun, but it's definitely at the ""so bad it's good"" stage now, at best.

Could have been great with better writing."
Outer Banks,Age doesn't matter!,I'm 73 and my husband and l loved it! Well played by all the actors. Great story line. I hope that there will be another season.
Outer Banks,It's a lot of fun!,I'm a sucker for a treasure hunt so this tipped my interest. Execution in cinematographye was fantastic. The characters are your typical band of bottom of the rung teenagers vs the super wealthy kids there on summer break. Twist and turns till the conclusion of season 1. Promising start for a modern day goonies.
Outer Banks,Farcical but Fun,"The O. C meets, The Goonies, meets National Treasure, that's how I would describe Outer Banks.

I watched all 30 episodes in 3 days so I must have been quite good.

It's your typical American show, Beautiful People in Beautiful Places, Love crossing the class divide and then throw in some farcical fun that these high school dropout kids can find ancient treasure experts never could, Escape from capture, take out trained military operatives, Drive every vehicle from car, van, truck to boat & survive for a month on an uninhabited island with just the clothes on their back.

If you loved the O. C, Goonies & National Treasure and you can overlook plot flaws in favour of entertainment then you won't be disappointed by Outer Banks."
Outer Banks,i´m 46 and i loved it,"Outer banks , has a little bit of everything, the value of friendship,young love, mystery and some action. binged it. got some OTH vibe."
Outer Banks,Starts Greats... Ends Horribly,"This Netflix show came out at a good time during the quarantine so it should get a lot of buzz. This is a show definitely targeting young teenagers. The acting is actually pretty solid for a show like this and the characters are very interesting. In the main group of kids we have John B, Sarah, Kiara, Pope, and JJ. These characters were great in this show and worked well together. The first 7 episodes of the season are all about looking for a lost treasure and it is amazing. Like I really loved the first 7 episodes. The last three episodes takes a whole new direction and it is so frustrating. The police start acting like TV cops and they don't even do any investigating. They shut down the whole island and have a man hunt of one mans word. These last 3 episodes are hard to watch and hurt this season so much. Also, does no one on this island have cell phones? Even if they didn't they would have some sort of device they could use over wifi. But this show likes to assume the audience is stupid so they do not explain any of this. This is something that happens in a lot of Netflix shows, they start great and just crumble. But check the season out and lemme know what you thought!"
Outer Banks,Cant stop watching it!,"So intriguing! I literally could not stop watching it. When I first started watching it I thought it would be background sound tv (something to listen to while working), but I haven't been able to work past episode 2. Its at a perfect pace, very active, very interesting! The acting is excellent for new actors, and the filming was great. I will definitely watch season 2 and I truly hope they kept the same writers because it'll be a shame if it goes south for second season."
Outer Banks,Ok - But not great,"Suffers a little from not having enough likable characters.

They are all superficially pretty, but lack competence in anything. All the adults are crooked or warped in some way. Every male character is violent to the point they are unhinged, and the female characters were so morally ambivalent that they didn't come off much better.

If you can stay with it, the plot twists, and is pretty good, but in the end I just couldn't believe there were that many people with such low IQs living together in one place.

The longer I write this review the more the mark drops, so I'll stop now."
Outer Banks,Unrealistic at times; but thoroughly fun,"Outer Banks is perfect for a quarantined summer weekend watch. It will make you revisit your Scooby-Doo and Enid Blyton days. The thrill of sharing secrets with friends, the little subtleties of teen romance, and facing your challenges as you step into adulthood will give you a nostalgic trip down memory lane.

The plot, however, will leave you wanting for more. You see the premise and the promise, and are left to wonder what a better written plot could have done to this. I refrain from giving spoilers, which makes it harder to describe how the last two episodes completely defy logic.

The actors did a pretty decent job though. All of them filled the shoes of their respective characters perfectly.

Verdict : It is definitely worth a watch. Just don't set your expectations too high."
Outer Banks,good then bad,"First 6 episodes or so started really really good. but, near the last few the show came to crumbles with the end plot. storyline and the logic of the last few episodes were really trash."
Outer Banks,You'll yell at the screen,"This was enjoyable somewhat, but when the police are after you take time to have a long kiss and discuss your life with your friends. Very unrealistic and frustrating. Could have been lots better with better writing."
Outer Banks,I live close to the outer banks,I love this show. It reminds me of Into The Blue with Paul Walker but made into a series. They do a great job portraying the obx given it wasn't filmed there. All in all it's an excellent show
Outer Banks,Woah!,"Boy oh boy! I binge watched this, (season 3) today in one BREATH! So many things going on every minute in these episodes and what makes it even better I can't even predict things that gonna happen next, they always surprise me so much with the plot. I love how thing are moving fast, we had only 10eps in this season yet saw so much adventures, fights, forgiveness, love, character developments etc. I truly enjoyed watching this more than any netflix show to be honest. The plot, the storyline it is so beautiful written, every detail is so well written. Please just announce that there is gonna be 10 seasons so I can sleep in peace. POGUE4LIFE!"

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Why does this only have a 8.3????,"JoJo is one of the weirdest and most entertaining anime's out there, and yet there's an emotional core to it. When people always talk about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure they always just talk about the memes or the great openings or the ""Enemy stando!"", but there's so much more to why people (including myself) love JoJo. Yes the memes and ridiculousness of JoJo is a ton of fun and certainly gives it the personality it's now become infamous for, but there is some truly incredible writing and characters in here. Plus because of the way the parts are laid out each one is unique and different, so if you didn't like the previous part then you'll probably like the next, then again literally every part is good except maybe the first. And the animation and music by David production is all fantastic."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Absolutely addictive,"I'm not that crazy about shonen in general, but there's something about JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE that just hooks you. It's so over the top, so surreal, and yet so emotionally earnest that one cannot help but be caught in its spell."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,"""Bizarre"" is the most appropiate word for this masterpiece","Generally, Jojo's Bizarre adventure is a title that have an incredible variety of situations through its stories. But Golden wind consolidates the work that Hiroiko Araki was doing since the series started, not just in a matter of drawing style, but in his narrating style.

Entertaining and thought-provoking through the stands of all of the characters, you are always thinking about how our heroes can defeat that enemy, the amazing and imaginative ways that every stand user control his/her stand (Specially Giorno, our central character in this ""season"") are completely fascinating. Mix all of this stuff with a catchy gang story and you have a gripping and incredible masterpiece that is still a must read on Japanese manga history"
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,I swear this anime is very unique and very very good,Holy I can't express how much I love this it's a masterpiece it's memes it's sound effects the dramatic letters and the fact that there's like 3 more parts for this series is very anticipating I recommend that you watch this anime it's very very good
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,*turn in feverish tears* LISTEN OKAY!,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has been a ride for me. I got into it, because of it's massive Impact on the anime community as a whole and how it bends the rules of traditional anime and makes me laugh and sob at the drop of a checkered hat. Stories in traditional ""shonen"" or ""for boys"" anime fall into obvious tropes that JoJo does not. Normal anime will follow a main character (mostly male) trying to solve a problem through fights. JoJo follows that guideline with some major improvements. When following one main character you run into the problem of the story becoming boring or the main character becoming so overpower that they seem not likable because they run out of the faults that make them human. JoJo switches off the baton of the main focus of the story with it not being about one Joestar, but a family of Joestars. Each Joestar has one problem to solve and a loads of amazing support characters that make this a lovable and amazing series pretty much perfect for me. that being said, I know this show is far from perfect with it's many plot holes and unfinished stories, and lets not talk about the way far away things look in the anime, but in my eyes this story of a family overcoming trials and tribulations is just enough for me to call it my favorite piece of fiction."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Bizarre indeed. I love it.,"I love it so much. I didn't know if I would when I started watching it, but as it went on I loved it more and more. It has great and memorable chatacters, stylish visuals, cool strategy-based action, incredible music and many dead dogs. Here are some quick thoughts about each part:

PHANTOM BLOOD: The first three episodes are a masterpiece. Drags a bit in the middle, but sticks the landing. Speedwagon rules

BATTLE TENDENCY: Joseph is great. Stronger and better paced than Phantom Blood, but it does drag a bit towards the end.

STARDUST CRUSADERS: Long, epic, incredible. The introduction of Stands changed the game. The crusaders are unforgettable.

DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE: My favorite part. I love the colors, the characters, the villain. Great Days is my favorite Jojo opening. A truly beautiful Duwang.

GOLDEN WIND: As always the main team is great. The torture dance is one of the finest pieces of animation ever created. Polnareff is turtle.

The Rohan OVAs are also great. I can't wait for Stone Ocean."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Not what you expect,"I've got to be honest, the first few episodes had me doubting what exactly what I was watching. I decided to stick through it and man...I'm glad I did. One word to describe this show....unique. I haven't watched the whole series yet, but with each episode I get that ""what happens next"" feeling. I am still relatively new to watching anime (I've watched a few series), but I can definitely say this is one I enjoy."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Best anime I have ever seen,"This show is one of the most influential series to come out of japan next to dragonball and fist of the north star. It is the reason we have games like persona or great fighting game characters like guile or juri. Jojo's bizarre adventure has influenced popular anime like One piece, Hunter x Hunter, Yu Yu hakusho, and Shaman king. One of the most unique things about it is its a different story with a different protagonist each time while still having a lore and continuity. This makes it impossible to judge based on a single or even multiple seasons the best parts are 7,8,2, and 4. one of the coolest things about JoJo is everyone who's a fan likes different parts one person could love part 5 and hate part 6 while another person could have the opposite opinion everybody loves part 7 though. all in all there's no other anime like this one it actually tends to appeal more to non anime fans due to its western feel."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,great fun!,"Don't know why this anime was split into parts 1 and 2. I just watched episodes 1-26, so I'm going to review it as one show.

It starts with a rich family (the Joestars) adopting a poor boy named Dio. Dio is the same age as the Joestar's son, Jonathan, and they become fierce rivals at everything trying to get the attention of Jonathan's father. Initially, Dio is better at everything, but as they grow up, Jonathan catches up to Dio, making him bitter and twisted. One day, he finds a stone mask, that when attached to his face, transforms him into an evil vampire...

The shows stretches over 3 generations of Joestars and each son is nicknamed Jojo. They spend their lives fighting vampires and other, stronger immortals.

What I really liked about this show was the humour. The characters were all great and the animation and action scenes were awesome, but the humour turned what could have been a dark, horror type story into something really fun. Normally, I'd prefer them to have left out the humour and gone down the dark path, but in this case, it really works well. Definitely worth a watch!"
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,One of the best animes I've seen,"Jojo's beautiful art,glourios and extraordinary fights,badass and awesome characters,villains are unique and badass too,the story is great,the memes,music references,the openings,the endings,the poses,the fashion,the music is INSANELY GOOD"
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,JoJo's,"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Uniquely Bizarre,"(Rating as an anime) I don't think I've seen a show quite like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. The show sits currently at 4 seasons (5 parts), and it remains fresh and unique. The animation (while there's some weak points) is for the most part, really good. Most of the fights are extremely interesting. They usually involve outwitting an opponent using their unique ability and the environment rather than pure strength, and it makes this fresh experience that I'm not used to seeing in a show about fighting. Characters are well written and fleshed out, and each have their own unique personality that really brings the show to life. I don't think there was really ever a point that I was bored. However, the first 9 episodes are probably the weakest. Episodes 1-9 (based off of the part titled ""Phantom Blood"") is as generic as the show gets. The characters are forgettable, especially the protagonist, Jonathan, whose main traits can be boiled down to ""I'm a nice guy"". Another criticism that I have with the show is that sometimes characters win battles with stupid conveniences, there are plenty of fights that characters use abilities that they've never used before, and never use again. It always felt like they were included just to give the character an edge in that specific situation. Other than that, I don't really have any other massive criticisms that I want to address. Overall, it's a great show and I'm giving it a 7/10. It's closer to an 8 than a 6."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Waste of time,"Every single episode is the same thing over and over again. A stand user attacks the protagonists, then the protagonists outsmart the villain of the week, and then they move on to the next one. It's literally over a hundred episodes of this happening again and again.

If you've seen one episode of Jojo, you've seen them all."

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,A story unlike many!,"Often a lesser gem in the Jojo series, Golden Wind in it's own right can be considered a masterpiece. A story which spans across Italy about a young man named Giorno Giovanna, who sets off on a journey with his friends which can rival Stardust Crusaders. A story about dreams, power, and lineage, follow this installment for a good time."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Peak fiction,"Peak fiction. There is no bad part of jojos peak adventure, from part 1 all the way to the now part 6 it has been consistently enjoyable and original.

10/10 animation.

10/10 characters.

10/10 plot.

10/10 character development."

JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Unexpectedly a lovable anime,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is beautiful madness, I'm glad this was recommended to me. Starts off very cruel, great buildup, awesome soundtrack and captivating story. I love the series it's badass even with a couple hours sleep! I'd probably enjoy any spin off and the video game. I've gotten really into this show and love it more than I could've imagined!"
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Simply the best,Jojo is an anime who is extremely underrated and didn't get the attention he deserves. 8.4 is truly a shame for this masterpiece which has inspired so many anime and mangas before
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,"Waste of time and not in a good ""i enjoyed my wasted time"" way.","This anime is really difficult to watch after so much time has passed from release, it just feels like an endless supply of episodes that have basically 2 different themes: 1st Jojo and companions travel to a new place and meet an enemy stand user that hands their asses to them, oh no how can they ever survive this attack?? 2nd they overcome the enemy with some witty and ""funny"" way for the 23rd time and keep going, rinse and repeat for 2 entire seasons. you can actually skip a dozen episodes and you wont realize you missed something (you didn't).

Animation quality (mostly walking and Jotaros pouting face) is not good, music is repetitive and not special, the story is an excuse for ""funny"" adventures and the humour is repetitive at best, annoying beyond belief at worst.

Characters are as interesting as sugar free vanilla ice-cream. Its not all bad, there are some actually pretty decent mini story-arcs if you bother watching it, which is why this is a 6 and not much lower."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,A masterpiece that everyone hates because of the overused memes,"If you hate seeing the memes, understandable. But if you swear off Jojo's because of it, you are stupid! Jojo's is my favorite anime and manga series because of how well the writing is."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Jo,"A Japanese manga set in Victorian England, where the adopted brother dio tries to steal the inheritance of jo jo. Both brothers have supernatural powers but one is based on good the other evil. Enjoyable monster vampire series but to be honest I enjoyed the early conflict between them more, before they acquired the powers. Having said that episodes which come later in the series are still entertaining."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Meh,I was recommended this beacuse I like dark themed animes but this was just so hard to watch. It just feels like screaming macho men most of the time. I could not bring myself to care about any character and the story isn't really interesting. I wanted to like it and forced myself through ten episodes of so but just.. no.
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,A Guilty Pleasure at Worst,"I have to hand it to this show: for all of it's plotholes, shallowness, and predictability, it completely makes up for it's flaws and more with it's outstanding art style, over-the-top energy, creative world, and memorable character designs. Almost every character has a special quality that makes them them and has an outstanding design that would make them STAND out in a crowd. None of even the minor characters have a generic design, and it adds to the vibrancy and uniqueness of the world.

If you don't mind a fair amount of exaggerated violence, check this show out from Part 1 to the upcoming Part 5 and beyond. Wether you're an anime fan or a simple showgoer, this animated series is too unique to pass by."
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,Yare Yare Daze,"Toxic fanbase aside, its not hard to see how this one series (especially the manga) has redefined and inspired many series that came after it. While some parts are better than others, even my least favorites are still pretty good. And of course I can't wait for the adaption of part 6!"

AlRawabi School for Girls,Ignore the low ratings,"This is a well acted and well paced series that makes us take a deeper look at what it means to be a woman in any society. Yes, we have seen the premise before, but we also all seen romance movies and will still watch them.

I noticed a lot of low rating stating that the plot of is series is American and never happens to Arabic girls, but I find it hard to believe that young Arabic girls are never mean to other girls. Sounds like people being overly defensive instead of wanting to acknowledge a potential problem.

These types of stories need to be told and this series does a great job of bringing something serious to light."
AlRawabi School for Girls,AMAZING,"It's like 13 reason why but Arabic story and honestly it was very interesting how the actress especially ""Layan"" play they role like they born with it !

The last episode was shocking and absolutely fantastic, maybe we can have another Jordanian work like this show."

AlRawabi School for Girls,Jordanian Mean Girls,"This story is like Mean Girls whereby a group of popular girls bully other girls but with a Jordanian flavor. After they beat a girl unconscious, she devises a plan for revenge. She gets a couple of friends to go help her with her plan.

One thing that is interesting is the attitudes towards women and girls. One girl is beaten up by her father, and no one raises any concern or objection. Oh, your dad punched you in the face. Teachers see a girl with obvious facial bruises and act as if nothing happened. Then one girl is harassed by an old man, and the teacher scolds the girl as if it's her fault for walking around showing all that skin.

The girls gossip and talk about Zac Efron. One girl has a bedroom that is like entirely pink. You start to feel like it's almost a western society, and then the crazy comes. The final revenge is unbelievably intense so shocking so insane."

AlRawabi School for Girls,Just give those girls a chance! GOD!,"Ignore all the haters and prepare your self to watch something that could be considered a step forward for Jordanian tv. Criticise constructively, its how we can support them."
AlRawabi School for Girls,A Tale of Two Seasons: Brilliant Beginnings and Disappointing Sequel,"Season 1 was brilliant, well thought out and engaging. *But* it set the bar for season 2 impossibly high.

Here are the main issues I had with season 2:

Tima Shomali, the producer, didn't disprove the rumors about the release date until many fake release dates circled around the internet in the 2.5 years we waited. She disproved them on 10 August 2023 and didn't even give us a rough timeframe. I get that she wanted to use the hype to her advantage but it has worked against her, as fans were infuriated by this whole situation
The show wasn't originally planned to have more seasons. The producer had clearly given in to the pressure from fans and/or the appeal of repeating season 1's success. She was out of ideas and it shows. I didn't appreciate that she changed the makeup of the series but recycled major plot points and gave us a similar ending to season 1






The bottom line is that it's hard to repeat the success of something undeniably remarkable and it's even harder to admit that you tried and failed.

I can't in good conscience give the show less than 7/10 and I only take away 3 stars because of season 2."
AlRawabi School for Girls,Great Job,"I don't know how people can't see that we suffer from the problem the series talks about in our society

It reflected young women problems in an Arabic private school in a really good way , keep up the good work Tima!!"
AlRawabi School for Girls,Control Z/Elite hybrid from Jordan,"The themes from both Spanish language series are here - unbridled wealth and the entitlement of the children of the rich from Elite and the possibility of hacking into accounts on computers and phones from Control Z. However, the issues dealt with in Al Rawabi are weightier and more pressing than those of the other two series.

Unfortunately neither the writing, direction or acting is up to the pressures of the urgencies of the plot. These are important social mores and changes that were presented. We see rich, mostly Westernised families nonetheless oppressing their daughters and not their sons while sending them to a school that allows short skirts and sports in shorts. And it's always the brothers. When I worked in Social Services many years ago, the problems we had in child protection were often with the brothers of Arab teenage girls who took a harder line than the parents.

The worst failure of this series was that the characters were not finely enough drawn. Rania, Roqayya and Layan were so utterly unsympathetic, despite efforts in the penultimate episode to humanise them a little, that one actually couldn't care less that they were heading for a terrible fall. Not even the revenge on Layan and its effects particularly moved me despite my knowing of the prevalence of episodes of her fate in Jordan and the Arab world. I live in an Arab country and am glad to say that this is not an issue here in my adopted land.

On the other hand, the episodes of bullying were so over the top and crudely drawn that no school could possibly have tolerated them especially as they were so blatant. This, in turn, made the reactions of the victims understandable but exaggerated.

This was a missed opportunity. That a production from a conservative Arab country touched on themes of lesbianism; patriarchy and its oppression of women; illicit relationships; religious suppression of women's freedom; extreme violence against women who ""rebel"" was a refreshing, adventurous and edgy innovation. It's just that it could have been done so much better."
AlRawabi School for Girls,"good idea, bad excution",Comentario no disponible
AlRawabi School for Girls,Different aspect of Jordan experienced,"This 6-episode series is a solid production from Jordan. I like to point my opinion in specific points if you bear with me 1- Its main case (and almost all cast) are females, which is something new to Jordan and even Arabic drama.

2- The music/songs in the series are pretty solid, seem to come from different accents. I didn't like it though when Liann was lip-singing to a well-known Arabic song for 3 minutes in Ep 3 or 4. Just felt very unauthentic. Otherwise music was superior.

3- The acting was mostly well-done, you could feel the expressions of pain/anger/joy on their faces are mostly real. Occasionally though you could feel it was amateurish.

4- The accent used was the ""modern"" Arabic spoken in Jordan, claimed to be one spoken by the wealthy even though I don't think that's true. However it's a dialect that the cast and producer probably felt more comfortable using but it's why other reviewers were disappointed calling this series a poor representative of the authentic traditional Jordanian accent.

5- the series focus on toxic relationships between students and bullying. I don't remember this being portrayed in Arab series before despite it happening in all Jordanian schools I know of (happened in my school and every Jordanian friend of mine in other schools).

6- There are some subtle feminist messages - it's not shameful to talk about your period, how women get degraded for being in love, ""the honor"" of a girl being permanently lost for sending a slightly inappropriate picture. I like how subtle but important these messages were.

I understand if others didn't like the series as much as I did. Possibly other men won't relate to it as much. But the ones who gave it a ""1"" are Jordanians triggered by a strong female cast, the discussion of tabooed topics, girls not being dressed very conservatively, the modern Jordanian accent....etc. The themes that this series focuses on are very widespread in Jordanian schools and in the society. Tina Shomali tried to avoid controversial scenes (no kissing) or language (no heavy swearing) in order to not distract from the main focus of the series.

Overall I think she and the crew did a great job."
AlRawabi School for Girls,The 1th series was better... than 2nd series....,"A very interesting TV series. The first year was very good, I watched it several times. It's interesting to see this cultural difference from here in Europe...how many things are the same, but many things are very different for young women in Jordan.

The situation of women in the Middle East is going through a big change and it is an interesting topic.

Your first year was strong and dynamic. Your second year was mediocre and the story was often excessively slowed down, and it contained quite a few story elements that were completely unreliable, unbelievable... not real.

I think, the 1st series was better, than 2nd... But, I wait the newer series.

Thank you."
AlRawabi School for Girls,Very weak series,It isn't perfect like I thought I think the actors need to be more trained I hope if there is another season focus more on how develop the performance for actors.
AlRawabi School for Girls,An Absolute Masterpiece - Award Worthy,"An absolute masterpiece. This mini-series explores the harsh reality of bullying, incompetent and abusive authority figures (including teachers, parents, and older siblings,) and the impact it all has on school-aged girls in Jordan. The harsh realities painted are relatable to any girl who has been to school in Jordan. The show highlights the experiences of girls growing up in an extremely sexist and misogynistic society, where living in constant fear of violence or being killed by their own families is the norm. From being objectified and likened to a glass panel to being blamed for becoming the victim of sexual assault. A girl is called cheap for taking a selfie without a scarf. The label cheap is used frequently to belittle, dehumanize and objectify girls from a young age measuring them only by their willingness to explore their natural feminine and heterosexual feelings. This show does a brilliant job of showcasing the twisted priorities of Jordanian and Middle Eastern society when it comes to women's rights. The girls are broken at home and find themselves breaking each other in school before they even have a chance to grow up. It's also interesting to note that 'the broken glass panel analogy' is never used to warn against abusing those girls to the point of breaking them."

AlRawabi School for Girls,Jordanian Masterpiece,"Let me tell you about this wild ride I just took with a Jordanian masterpiece that shook me to my core! So, picture this: I'm all about those classic Egyptian and Syrian dramas, right? They've been my go-to for as long as I can remember, always thinking they were the kings of the Arab TV scene. But then, out of nowhere, Jordan swoops in and drops this bombshell of a show that completely blows my mind!

I mean, seriously, every single scene is like a meticulously crafted piece of art. The attention to detail, the seamless storytelling, it's all there. And let's talk about the music, man. They didn't just slap some generic tunes in the background; they went all out with that Arabic flavor and local beats, adding this whole new dimension to the series.

But you know what really takes the cake? The fact that this gem was produced right in Jordan. Who would've thought, right? Huge props to Tima Al Shomali for spearheading this project and bringing such an incredible show to our screens. It's a game-changer, no doubt about it. So, if you're looking for your next binge-worthy obsession, trust me, this is it. Get ready to be hooked from the get-go! 🚀"
AlRawabi School for Girls,Meh 😕,"Its not that bad but its not good too. I wont lie im a bit district because I expected more that than especially after (jinn) the first jordanian Netflix production.

Poor acting by some actresses bin some episodes, but a very decent cinematography.

The biggest flaw of the show in my opinion is about the script itself, when i was watching it felt like a westernized show to me, but in arabic. Maybe thats how west ammanies talk but jordan is more than that.

To be honest, the story and the show itself had a lot of potentials but they mistreated it in some episodes.

In conclusion: it not GOT. But its a good tv series if you wanna stay up late with your friends and watch together, nothing more."
AlRawabi School for Girls,The Untold Stories of Jordan's Schoolgirls,"An exceptional piece of storytelling, this mini-series delves into the grim realities of bullying and the pervasive influence of abusive authority figures on school-aged girls in Jordan. It sheds light on the experiences of girls navigating a deeply sexist and misogynistic society, where fear of violence and familial retribution is commonplace. From objectification to victim-blaming, the show starkly illustrates the myriad challenges faced by young girls. It skillfully unveils the distorted priorities of Jordanian and Middle Eastern societies regarding women's rights, depicting how girls are often broken at home and further fractured in school. Notably, it refrains from using the 'broken glass panel analogy' to caution against mistreating these girls to the point of shattering their spirits."
AlRawabi School for Girls,This review is as unbiased as it can get,"I'll ignore the Jordanian culture controversy and rate it as a normal show. The acting is almost good, but sometimes cringy. The story/idea is brilliant but the plot is 6/10, it had many plot holes. Cinematography and production are amazing as usual since it's Netflix. This show was well directed but the writing could've been better, it wasn't bad, but could've been better. The script was sometimes cringy as well, but mostly good. Music was great. Overall 6 or 7 out of 10.

Now when it comes to realism, i just hope that someday they'll make a Jordanian show where the vibe actually feels like real life. No doubt, everything that happened in this show does happen in real life, regardless of why many people say otherwise. But the vibe just isn't Jordanian. It would be awesome if the way they live, talk or look at each other, even their facial expressions, convey our behavior in real life. This makes it 10x more realistic. It wasn't the events that made this show unrealistic, it was the mannerism of a Jordanian person that they didn't perfect."
AlRawabi School for Girls,Lacks originality,"The two stars are for the cinematography and production. It's a good start for Jordanian drama but it's a copy of many teenager's series on Netflix, nothing original about it. Many people claim that this series sheds light on what's happening in Jordan but it's way too exaggerating & dialgue can be a meh at times."
AlRawabi School for Girls,A huge step for Jordanian TV,"I have binge-watched the series on one sit.

And honestly, I was blown away! However not at first.

I started the series with zero expectations, and through the first episode I thought the lingo and the acting was a little bit cringy (for me as a native Arabic speaker). But later this was all thrown away with their amazing acting and direction!

Do not compare this work with international titles, however on some level it competes with Netflix's successful originals.

What is awesome about this series is that it chooses a specific community in Jordan and discuss the lifestyle of this community, with talking about major problems nationally such as honor-killings and bullying, which both are critical issues in Jordan that people are afraid to talk about!

This series comes through to show that the Jordanian community is diverse but still suffers from nation-wide problems, and these families are not exempted from being affected by all of this.

Great work and hope for another season with focusing more on a more-accurate lingo and train some of the new actors harder."
AlRawabi School for Girls,"I feel it is a copy of 13 Reasons Why Unfortunately, it is a weak version","But frankly, I attended the first episode and felt the customs and most of the behaviors are Western, not from our traditions, but the effort is respected and the acting is good, but there was a weakness in the facial expressions of the actresses. The production is beautiful, but it lacks deep and strong dialogues."
AlRawabi School for Girls,Stop copying other people's work,I don't understand how some people are cheering for this show and they can't see that it's just a copy of other shows.. I didn't not enjoy any second of it.. had to watch it till the end with my family but we kept laughing at the bad acting and the so predictable story.. really bad. Not recommended.
AlRawabi School for Girls,Being a western person,"Not really sure how Jordan lifestyle is, but that wasn't western like everyone is saying. Maybe some of the music, but that's about it. Lol or are westerners the only ones that have teenagers that bully others? If they threw a McDonald's in there I would have agreed, but other than that, very different. Honestly I like seeing a different aspect to a typical teen show and found it entertaining. Hope there is a season 2 because of that ending."
AlRawabi School for Girls,"Great story, some cringe acting","Worth a watch! The story is very interesting and thrilling to watch. Is is a dramatic story and important representation from middle east. You wont get bored of watching this at all. One thing that bothered me the most is the acting which made me realise I was watching a TV-show. I wish that great story made me forget that feeling The acting is not realistic and too kliché. It reminds me of actors acting on disney channel which is just too exaggerated and cringe. It was sometimes so exaggerated that it sometimes felt like a kids show with a grown up plot.

Pros: Great story, you wont get bored Cons: Non-realistic and exaggerated acting."
The Parkers,One of the funniest Black US sitcoms I have seen,"The Parkers was the spin-off of Brandy's sitcom 'Moesha' and whereas the latter was often much more of a dramedy-type of show, this show was purely made for laughs. Mo'Nique is outrageously funny as Nikki Parker and is arguably the main star of The Parkers. her constant obsession with the Professor is one of the funniest things about this show. although it is also one that got on viewers nerves as well.

I have to say I was never a fan of 'Moesha' and so I was very surprised by The Parkers when I watched a couple of episodes of this sitcom a couple of years ago because it was a totally different type of comedy show. The emphasis was predominately driven by clean humour, physical comedy and laugh out loud comic situations and mishaps, which are some of the most important elements for any good sitcom, regardless of its target audience and whether it is a Black or White sitcom.

It was strange though that the professor, Stanley, of whom had a strong dislike of being stalked by Nikki for a large part of the show, later on as it progressed, decided he did have feelings for her after all. That, in particular, made no sense whatsoever. he was your usual pleasant and nice guy still. Nonetheless, the remaining characters Kim, Andell, Stevie and T were all interesting, and it was also great to see Jenna Von Oy back on screen, this time as one of Kim's friends Stevie, after her earlier stint as Six in the much successful early 90s sitcom,'Blossom'.

It was such a shame The Parkers ended so early, and although the last episode was rather rushed and out-of-sync with the actual plot of the show, at least it was wrapped up in the end. The one thing that I wished had happened but of which it didn't, was for Stevie and T to get together and consummate their relationship.

Still, The Parkers was and probably still is one of the very rare Black sitcoms televised back in the day, and one of which was consistently funny throughout and attracted a good number of viewers."
The Parkers,If it wasn't for Nikki Parker Monique I would have never watch this show,Comentario no disponible
The Parkers,Just like Moesha it was black and bland at the same time.,"The Parkers were a more noticeable show than Moesha. Neither are more better or worse than the other. If I had to choose I would choose Parkers because it was slightly better but nothing drastic.

The Parkers is another sitcom revolving around Kim. A character with heart and morals that gets into mindless trouble. She is surrounded by loud moth mother and crew.

When I was younger because of this show, I always cringed when a movie or show featured Mo'nique. She often always played loud mouth characters and I really didn't like her because of that. Iunno why. Then fast-forward a decade I realized she was more chilled behind the scenes so the cringe is no more.

The Parkers were an alright show. A ton of melaninated folks liked this show. Most shows that can reach over 5 years deserves respect."
The Parkers,Modern Day Lucy,"I LOVE THIS SHOW! I have seen every episode and I laugh out loud each and every time I do. The show is sheer entertaining! It is not meant to give any meaning, it is just what it is, a side-splitting comedy. The characters are very believable and the guest stars are stupendous! I LOVE Mo'Nique as Nikki Parker and Countess Vaughn as her dim-witted daughter who can sang, Kim Parker (you will fall in love each and every time you see them) they are hilarious and a GREAT team of actors! HEYYY!! Dang Mama! The shows originality is overwhelming (Definately a CLASSIC)! I would love to own ALL seasons! The sets are colorful, the plots are simple and hysterical! I would love to see the series come back! They should do an encore, like they have done for the Brady Bunch and Eight is Enough!"
The Parkers,Good laughs!,"I honestly love this show. It's cheesy, cute and full of laughs. Even the intro is a breath of fresh air. I still watch this show...especially now that it's on Netflix. 10/10!"
The Parkers,Comfort comedy!,"I have only ever seen this sitcom in passing, but when Netflix added more black centered sitcoms I decided to add it to the list! Mo'nique has always made me laugh growing up as a child, her humor isn't simply based off of crude jokes. She knows how to have fun without hurting anybody, I also enjoyed that this wasn't simply a statement show, but a show people could watch to have a good laugh!"
The Parkers,I wish there was a spin off of this or something,"I just finished watching the entire series on Netflix and this show really threw me on some episodes and touched my soul in the others and sometimes in the same episode. This show is hilarious, relatable, and everything I could ask for. Sometimes it had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was about to happen with Nikki and the professor with the continuous banter and hoping for the moment when that banter turns into something way better. If you've never watched this, you absolutely should. You can't always find good shows like this. The Parker's is funny, relatable for many, touches on key issues here and there, has plot twists, and is just overall a must watch show."
The Parkers,Best sitcom ever,"This is the best show in the whole wide world. If this it came on all day, everyday I would never get tired of it. I love the characters. They are so funny! I especially like Kim...she reminds me of myself...lol. I really wish it would come back on. It would be nice to see what the old characters are up to. I would love to see what happens after Nikki and the Professor got married (Even though I think she should have married Johnny).

Also, just my personal opinion. I think reruns of this show should come on more often than just Saturday mornings on BET (when nobody is awake). If we can watch reruns of Seinfield and Friends all hours of the day and night, surely we can get more reruns of a show that was actually funny."
The Parkers,absolute crap,"Extortion? Black mail? Embezzlement? Invasion of privacy? Intimidation tactics? Bullying T? Calling his mother names, because you THINK she is flirting with a man whose not even interested in you? Control issues? These things are actually funny? This show is absolutely one of the stupidest shows in the history of the world. I would seriously love to have a chat with the writer of the show. The writer, I say, of this senseless script. I also want to have a chat with the people who say they love this steaming pile of cow dung called ""The Parkers"".

It did not help that Dorien Wilson was portrayed as a loser and an idiot. I want to know what are the real qualifications to be a junior college professor, why was his character so bad lucky and what was cool or funny about the things Mrs. Parker did.

I agree that the last episode in particular deserves thumbs down. Considering everything that had happened during the previous five years, you would think that the professor would be elated. That did not happen. He suddenly thought he was in love with Mrs. Parker. The writer went as far as to portray him as the bad guy. So what they are saying is that it is cool to stalk, steal and invade someone's privacy."

The Parkers,Funny Sitcom!,"I always get a kick out of watching this show. Even though it's not a groundbreaking program, it is very funny. Mo'Nique makes this show! She always spoke her mind, and wouldn't take any bad stuff from anyone, with the exception of ""The Professor"" or ""Boo"". Everyone on this show seemed to have a connection with one another, which came across on the screen. This show wasn't broadcast to make a statement, it was just an entertaining half-hour, which is a rarity nowadays. Like all good things, they must come to an end. I am sad to see this show go off the air, but it's had a good run. One thing is for sure, it was a 100% better than any of the sitcoms that are on the 4 major networks. I hope to see Mo'Nique in other future TV shows and movies, I always get a kick out of her humour! I hope this show becomes available on DVD!"
The Parkers,Hilarious 2000's comedy era,"Monique's dynamic acting ranges shines through. The rest of the cast is so perfect as well. I haven't laughed so much in a long time. I love how each episode outside of all the comedy, they always try to show a meaningful life lessons. I love the comedic and loving relationship between Kim and Nikki. I love how each cast member had a opportunity to shine and you could easily relate and grow with the character/storyline. This was a good era for black comedic sitcoms. I truly love the Parker's. You'll laugh, cry and love through the seasons. Im glad Netflix added this."
The Parkers,Love this show,I really enjoyed this show Mo'nique is hilarious and the crew she really is talented....I still watch this show today and still makes me laugh...I hope she comes up with bringing it back it was a hit!!
The Parkers,The Parkers,"I love the show....I watch it twice a day here in Chicago.

I thought originally the show was focused on silly little Kim, but I guess you can only have so much silliness. Then the focus went on ""Nicole"" and the Professor. This was really on point. The cat and mouse chase is hilarious!!! Its pretty clean...

All the characters are pretty funny. Its great writing. I wish there was a continuation of this funny sitcom. I would've love to have seen more on the characters of Andell, Stevie and T. On point you did a cameo of Woody the cook.

Its also funny how the story did those spoof of Dallas and other shows. This is some fully stuff. Can anyone tell me why it went off production? Good shows like this never last.

I would like to know where the actors are now and whats going on in their lives.

Its slated to be removed 9/1. If anyone know how to get this show back in Chicago on any station, please let me know. Thanks"
The Parkers,Our break room TV has been stuck on BET for weeks,"Let me start by saying BET has a lot of great shows, like Blackish and Martin. The Parkers is not one of those shows. I think Monique is fine, I've always liked her stand up comedy. Honestly the weak point of this show is the daughter. She is loud, whiny, entitled, and her voice is grating. The fact that they worked in her annoying giggle laugh into the theme song, so I have to listen to that multiple times every day, makes me want to stick my head in a microwave and hit the popcorn setting. The show itself is lazy 90's writing of black stereotypes. Personally I'd rather watch Fresh Prince or Family Matters."
The Parkers,FUNNY STORIES,"WHO DOESNT LOVE THE PARKERS??? FROM THE MUSICAL THEME OPENING INTRO TO; THE HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF NIKKI PARKER; THE BUMBLING DITZINESS OF DAUGHTER KIM, YOU WERE IN FOR 30 MINUTES OF KNEE-SLAPPING COMEDY AND ANTICS FROM THIS TALENT CAST. IT WAS A CUTE COMEDY, PERIOD. LOL"
The Parkers,"Sort of funny, but very annoying and stupid overall","Like the reviewer who also gave this a low rating, I have mixed feelings as well. I didn't wanna give it a 1, but it's definitely on the lower end of the spectrum if you're looking at 90s/early 2000s sitcoms as a whole. I was too young to watch episodes of The Parkers in their entirety when it first came on TV, but I have vivid memories of it. I thought it was funny as a kid, especially when Mo'Nique would always say 'hey, boo!' But I have a different opinion of it now as an adult. It comes on Dabl every day at 5/5:30pm EST. I did enjoy it, but I guess that's because I hadn't seen it in such a long time. After a while I found myself increasingly annoyed with how dumb it is. The only time I watch it is if I happen to be in the living room when it's on.

Mo'Nique plays Nikki Parker. She attends Santa Monica College with her daughter, Kim (Countess Vaughn). She dropped out of high school when she got pregnant with Kim, so she wanted to get an education to better herself. The main source of comedy is her obsessively chasing after one of the instructors, Professor Oglevee (Dorien Wilson). It starts out as humorous in the beginning of the series, but reaches a point of going from a harmless love interest to just being downright unsettling. The episodes also focus on the antics of Kim and her friends, which are all very stupid and lack believability.

Don't get me wrong - I really have nothing against turning off my brain for entertainment purposes. My job is stressful, so it's nice to watch something ridiculous at the end of the day, but some things are so stupid that they get on my nerves. It's a bizarre sitcom. The characters live in the real world, but their situations are so outlandish, that it's like they're in an alternate universe. The storyline would've been rejected if it portrayed what really happens in life. Because let's be real - they would never make a show where a man stalks and terrorizes a woman, and/or commits acts of unwanted touching, like pinching or grabbing them by the butt. People would be so disgusted and shocked. Yet they laugh when a woman is the one who's being a perv. But hey, the US has crazy and outdated beliefs when it comes to anything gender-related, so what do you expect?

Mo'Nique is hilarious in the role, but the stalking just takes the humor out of it for me. I might think it was funny if I hadn't of been stalked myself. It was a scary experience. I'm thankful it didn't escalate to the point where I had to get the police involved. I used to work in a library, and I was harassed by a couple of the patrons. The first was an older man, and the second was a guy around my age. He seemed po'ed that I gave him a fake number when he asked for mine. I only did that so he would go away. He actually came back a few days later and walked up to me as I was shelving books, wanting to know why I didn't give him my real number. He left me alone afterwards. I felt uncomfortable, violated, and quite honest, kind of terrified. It's not fun having to wonder if some nut is going to be waiting for you outside when your shift ends. If I was a man, I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy women who I wasn't attracted to following me around. I don't think anybody enjoys being followed around. Some things just don't have a comedic element, no matter how many angles you look at it from. This is a waste of time, even if you want something to veg out to."
The Parkers,Funny Show,"I watch The Parkers a lot. It's one of my favorite sitcoms, and the best that UPN offers. Monique and Countess Vaughn are both talented, as well as the supporitng cast. Compared to other of the UPN sitcoms, they "" Keep it Real"". Hope to see some reruns when it goes into syndication this fall."
The Parkers,007 Crushindo,"By far one of my favorite black shows to air on T. V. alone. I honestly love their witty comebacks to each other. Huge shout out to Mo'nique for being a bright light on the show. Even when her character is upset, she still manages to find a way to pick herself up. The whole cast is wonderful from Countess to Ken, Dorien, and finally Yvette! (RIP Yvette). My family, moms in particular loved this show in her younger days. We used to watch it all the time every time it showed on it's specific time. I was child at the time so I don't remember exactly what time. This show demonstrated black excellence, black humor, and black intelligence all in one. A show we will never forget!"
The Parkers,I love this show!,"Another popular 90s black show, spin-off from Moesha. It was great to watch from the Parkers point of view, Nikki & Kim mother & daughter duo is hilarious. I always use to watch this show on BET with my mother & sister it's family friendly. The outfits were fabulous and the music was banging. I will never forget freestyle unity and all the bops that were created."
The Parkers,Review of The Parkers - A Binger's Delight,"As a self-proclaimed binge-watcher, I found myself diving into The Parkers expecting a lighthearted trip down memory lane-and let me tell you, it delivered! This show is a delightful blend of humor, heart, and just the right amount of outrageousness to keep you hooked episode after episode.

The chemistry between Mo'Nique and Countess Vaughn is pure gold. Their mother-daughter dynamic, full of sass, love, and lots of laughs, made for the perfect combination. Mo'Nique as Nikki is hilarious, effortlessly balancing comedy with heartfelt moments, while Countess Vaughn's Kim brings the perfect mix of naivety and charm. The show's secondary characters, including the lovable college crew, add even more flavor to the already colorful storyline.

What makes The Parkers such a binge-worthy treat is the balance between slapstick humor and moments of genuine emotion. It never takes itself too seriously, but there's enough character growth and lighthearted drama to keep you invested. It's like the ultimate comfort food-easy to watch, funny, and always entertaining.

It's an easy watch for any fan of 90s sitcoms, and if you're looking for a feel-good, laugh-out-loud binge that'll leave you grinning, The Parkers is your show. Grab some popcorn, maybe a cozy blanket, and get ready to laugh until your cheeks hurt.

In short, it's a fun, nostalgic ride with quirky characters that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it!"

The Parkers,It's da bomb!,"The Parkers has stolen the hearts of many people throughout it's run on UPN on Monday nights. Now that it is in syndication I laugh with Nikki, Kim, and the gang every day. The Parkers is very entertaining and sometimes even educational(Not with Kim tough).My favorite episode was the episode when T found out his honey was HIV positive which also dealt with racism.I am hispanic but I feel identified with the African American community also. Monique's character Nikki, is not scared to speak her mind and I really think that's one of the reason why her character has been successful. The PArkers is the best show on UPN. No other show on UPN can make me laugh as much as the Parkers On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 9."
The Parkers,Moesha's Friend Spins Off,"Kim Parker continues to be just as boy-crazy as she was when her character was on ""Moesha"". On this show, we learn that she gets this trait from her mother Nikki, who chases after stiff Professor Ogilvie in every episode. Unlike ""Moesha"", which has turned into a dramedy over the past couple of years, ""The Parkers"" are all about fun. Viewers with good memories will remember Jenna Van Oy as having been a regular on ""Blossom"". Countess Vaughn, who plays Kim, had a reoccuring role on ""227"", and was also a ""Star Search"" contestant in the singing category."

Paradise Beach,Great!,"Paradise Beach is definitely one of the best drama series available. I have always liked Australian shows, and this is definitely not an exception. Good and realistic storylines, with good and talented actors.

The only downside is that the show doesn't have the best ending, due to the fact that the show was canceled very sudden without any chance for the producers to gracefully end the show."
Paradise Beach,This show was pretty bad,"This show was pretty bad but unlike the person who wrote the previous review I wouldn't say it was the worst show ever on Australian television.There have been a couple of Australian shows worse than Paradise Beach. One of those shows was an early eighties show called Holiday Island.It was a soapie set in a resort on a tropical island.The series which was supposed to be set in Queensland was mostly filmed in Melbourne.There were some scenes where you could actually see the goose bumps on the actors because they were so cold from filming scenes wearing swimwear during a Melbourne winter.There was even a scene where you could see condensation from the breaths of the actors.Yes the acting in Paradise Beach was terrible however there were some interesting faces who appeared in the series such as Matt Latanzi(Olivia Newton Johns ex-husband), Isla Fisher from Scooby Doo and The Wedding Crashers and Ingo Rademacher from Another World.It was good to watch if you like to see hunks or babes in scantily clad swimwear.The story lines at the beginning were pretty terrible but towards the series end they really started to improve and the show really started to pick up.Unfortunately though that all came too late and the show was canceled."
Paradise Beach,Just plain dreadful,"Paradise Beach is the most poorly acted and written Australian show of all time.I remember thinking how bad it was when I was eleven years old.It's like ""Days of our lives"" but this is much worse.The dialogue and situations are just laughable.At times you would swear it was a send up of soap operas."
Paradise Beach,"Terrible show, hot girls, Megan killed herself.","This was one of the most badly produced cheap shows of all time Australian TV. They just paraded models around and pretended they could act. A lot of people talk about the bad acting in Neighbours and Home and Away but the acting in Paradise Beach was so much worse.

A bit sad to hear Megan Connolly killed herself in 2001, I did not even know that until today. She was the hot blonde teen star (Tori Hayden) and the actress Kimberly Joseph played (Cassie Barsby)who was the hot brunette teen star. I met them at an appearance where they were giving away stuff as a promotion for the show. Very hot girls. Megan seemed the most down to earth, friendly 'girl next door' type girl. She didn't' mind chatting to her fans at all, quite different to Kimberly who thought she was 'all that' and seemed fake.

It was filmed on the Gold Coast and for some insane reason The fate of the show rested with overseas sales. Well the show was terrible so it never was going to sell well, I think it was sold to a United States cable network but it really did badly and was quickly axed.

So because continued production depended on good overseas sales income it did not come back for it's 2nd season and all the story lines were left up in the air."
Rebellion,Worth the watching,"I am from Northern Ireland, so I have to declare an interest in watching this series. After what I felt was a shaky start, I found myself being drawn into the personalities and the events. Episode by episode it seemed to improve. The sets and characterisations were convincing. If there is the odd historical inaccuracy well, this is not a documentary, it is entertainment ... and in that it succeeds."
Rebellion,Annoying,"Beautifully made. But they replaced three perfectly good female characters with three others, while keeping many of the other (male?!) players in situ for season 2. Not only did this complicate and confuse but frankly dissolved my enthusiasm. I think it undermines the story itself, since everything other than the headlines are fictional."
Rebellion,How come they all got Rory McIlroy eyes?,"Has anyone else noticed ? I'm enjoying it as a history lesson that was never even mentioned in school when I was growing up in Liverpool. Strange, because half the population was Irish (as was my own Grandmother). Strange too, because it's only now that I'm learning that the English aristocracy treated the peasants in much the same way as they treated the natives in their colonies. We in Liverpool were too busy trying to eke out a life to be concerned with what was going on in the rest of the dominion. But as I get older and see what mentality drove that same aristocracy, then I have no boundaries for my distaste for them. First of all they take all of the land, then they take all of the resources the land has to offer, then they sequester the crops, then they charge rents for the properties they've stolen. You want more? They call you up to fight their battles for them.

Even that's not enough, they lay ownership to all of the wildlife, birds, beasts, fish and fowl, and pass laws that allow for beatings and execution for any transgressions. Then they turn their attention to the winsome young lasses who grow up in the villages and decide that they should have the right to be the first one to screw them if they so desire.

All of this without a peep of protest to be countenanced............ no wonder the peasants got mad and rebelled.

It's not stellar stuff but it's interesting enough to keep you watching.

I can't get over how I've suddenly realised that there is something that can be called an ""Irish"" face."
Rebellion,"Full of fervour, but lacks coherence","Rebellion is a worthy attempt to place the Easter Rising of 1916 and the later rebellions involving the key figures of Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera in a historical context. The arrogance of the British and the keen nationalism of the Irish is depicted with great vigour. The support of the Americans in the Irish uprising is also a vital component. What the series fails to display is the lack of planning in carrying out the rebellion against the British rule, and as a result the programme as a whole lacks coherence. This was particularly obvious in the first series where the Rebellion appeared to be little more than an attempt to take over Dublin Castle.

First class acting, matched by beautiful sets - the Dublin of 1920 is shown as a city where British hedonism is counter balanced by the relative poverty of the Irish - makes a strong visual statement, and the harsh handling of both rebellions by the British Government makes one understand how Eire eventually became a republic."
Rebellion,Superb emotional rendition.,"I am 85, I was not there, but met Irish (Republic) people in 1949 in Bradford UK, who had relatives alive and emotionally in this historic event. I was 18 (and from a small community) I was forever imbued by the emotions I witnessed, and the varied descriptions. The programme literally had me saying prayers, I was captivated, excited and horrified with the poverty depicted, which I was personally familiar with, being moved about during the WW11. This is a highly enthralling programme, I was very disappointed to learn that episode 5 is the last one. For me the realism was total, the emotions entirely believable. Casting and acting magnificent. I watched the 5 episodes on Netflix."
Rebellion,Another Anachronism,Comentario no disponible
Rebellion,Fantastic Mini Series on the Birth of Ireland as a nation.,"I saw this on Netflix and it starts in 1914 where we meet a group of Dubliners, some of whom are still loyal to an ever distant British Crown and others who are confined by the bonds of a colonial power that has abused and neglected its closest colony for hundreds of years – rebellion is in the air.

This has many of the real people at the time being portrayed including Padraig Pearse and James Connolly to name but two. But it is really told through the eyes and experiences of three women – a touch I liked very much. We have five succinct episodes that chart the road to the 1916 uprising and the consequences and I have to say I thought it was excellent.

Now there are some critics who say this is a trivialised account by the state owned RTE television company and as such has airbrushed a lot of the important details. It may well have done but there is still enough here to give a real flavour of what the times were like.

It is a big budget affair too with some stellar performances including Brian Gleeson and Ruth Bradley but no one does a bad job at all. I loved the period detail and the use of Gaelic in parts added to the authenticity and made me realise my Gaelic is sorely rusty. The action scenes are excellent too with all the tense atmosphere and raw emotion pouring off the screen. Historical licence aside this is still an ambitious and well realised TV series. My only real complaint is I wanted it to go much farther and would love a second season or maybe even a third – truly recommended."
Rebellion,Shoddy storytelling in nice historical setting,"The series gives a nice view of the age, has great sets, costumes, props and is historically accurate enough. It's not clear enough, though, to give a clear, documentary understanding of this chaotic period of Irish history. Locations, abbreviations, titles and such are given without explanation or context. Events are given in chronological order, but the story skips along the timeline, missing important connections and events. Unfortunately the storytelling is not good enough to make it an interesting drama, either. The individual story arcs are predictable, cliche, and very limited in scope. Character arcs are largely individual and hardly ever linked to others'. Some seem to be entirely unnecessary to tell the story. There are way too many missed opportunities for true, engaging drama."
Rebellion,"Historical analysis is missing, but still a lovely production","This is a very pretty, but confused telling of the 1914-1922 period in Ireland. There are too many characters who look and talk the same, and have little to distinguish them.

More significantly, we are given no idea that in the decades leading up to 1914 there actually were three different factions in Ireland with regard to the country's membership in or relationship to the United Kingdom:-

Home Rule campaigners: they were the dominant political movement in Ireland. They looked to have the Irish Parliament reestablished in Dublin, as it had been prior to 1801. This initiative was finally passed by the Parliament in Westminster in 1913-1914, and would have been put in force had it not been for the outbreak of war in August 1914.




-The Unionists, who regarded Ireland as 'West Britain' and wanted no autonomy for Ireland at all.

With regard to the last, it's notable that this TV series leaves out the essential fact that rebellion in Ireland was initiated not by the Republicans but by the Unionists.

In 1914, just before Home Rule was to be put in effect, Unionist officers in the Curragh Barracks in Dublin declared themselves in defiance of the British government and readied for armed revolt. This so-called Curragh Mutiny was defused by the outbreak of the Great War. But it's crucial to know that it was senior British officers in Ireland, not Republicans or Home Rulers, who first rebelled and set the stage for the civil wars that followed. Without this backstory, the events set forth in 'Rebellion' really make no sense."
Rebellion,Good Irish Whiskey in a Broken Glass,"Superb cast and production value, with adequate direction severely undermined by character and plot disconnects between the two seasons. Why in heaven's name were more than half the strong players and storylines of season 1 disgarded for season 2? Pivotal, well drawn characters simply disappeared into an Irish fog. Obviously some producer or writer decided to fix what was not broken. Nevertheless Gleason is marvelous carrying the the disjointed storyline through the final season."
Rebellion,"Accuracy isn't entirely there, but the feeling of the era is certainly there","The most important things to know about the Easter Rising were that it marked the return to violent rebellion in Ireland and the way that the English dealt with it started the turning the sympathies of the Irish at large against the English and the idea of home-rule as part of the Empire. Those two things are very well demonstrated in Rebellion, from the brutal dealing of the British military with both the rebellion and Irish civilians, the complete lack of due process for those arrested and executed, creating martyrs and setting the stage for the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War."
Rebellion,Rebellion,Comentario no disponible
Rebellion,"Reasonably entertaining, but many inaccuracies","It's an entertaining story, but it feels like the characters are stereotypes, not real people. Perhaps more grating is the fact that inaccuracies and anachronisms abound. The time is 1916, but there are several terms used which never appeared in English at the time. The character of May uses the term 'brainwashed', which first appeared - in the US - in the early 1950s during and after the Korean War; an apparently British character says 'lootenant' when the correct British pronunciation is 'leftenant' (for some mysterious reason, but that's another discussion). When giving absolution, the priest uses 'Holy Spirit', which only came into use after Vatican II around 1963; 'Holy Ghost', was the term used by Catholics until that time. These are just the things that jumped out at me in the first two episodes."
Rebellion,Tough going,"Good acting and they've done a good of recreating 1916 Dublin but God this is slow paced, humourless and dull. I know a mini-series about the Easter Rising is never going to be a barrel of laughs but watching this was a tedious slog."
Rebellion,This is not a documentary !,"Great series, watched it 3 times.

Will make those who know nothing about Ireland in the 20 th century want to do more research.

The conflict between the brothers, British soldier v freedom fighter, was close to home.

Can't wait to see series 3."
Rebellion,Season 2 needs Cliff Notes,"There were so many actor changes in Season 2 that cliff notes should be provided. Best to watch it as if it is a new series otherwise, it will drive you bonkers trying to figure out the characters."
Rebellion,Fantastic period drama,"I loved this series. Highly addictive, compelling with some amazing tension throughout. Brilliantly written and superb acting throughout. As someone who's not particularly academic I've always struggled to learn about history the conventional way, through books, so am always grateful when TV teaches me something new. This series had my scurrying to the history books afterwards to find out more. The characters were all really easy to identify with and there was a much more realistic representation of the lower classes than is usual in period dramas. There was some wonderful dialogue-free sequences throughout the series which were just mind-blowingly good. I cant wait for season 2."
Rebellion,Easter Rising : A Victory for Feminism,"I quite enjoyed this, it felt quite immersive and gave you a sense of the time period, good locations, costumes etc. Also gave a variety of different perspectives - rich and poor, Catholic and Protestant, pro and anti-British.

Amazing to me though how there's never any attempt at objectivity in these shows, the British always have to be portrayed as thuggish and pointlessly evil. To prop up the identity of these smaller countries. Just like Kesari which I watched a few weeks back about the Sikhs defending British India against Muslim tribesmen - had the British officer calling Indians 'cowards' for no good reason.

And there was the feminist angle. What was the point of the Easter rebellion again? Well it was because men have always told women what to do, and joining the rising meant freedom for women..or some such.

identity politics is truly bizarre."
Rebellion,Character relationships made this a great series,"I quite enjoyed this mini series and look forward to another season. It started slowly and the characters were a little wooden but soon got interesting until I couldn't wait to watch more and missed out on sleep! It all looked very good - costumes, hair and sets but it seemed a little like a student play with freshly made costumes until the action started. The relationships got more complicated as the series developed and that saved the show from being a boring historical drama. The main actors were great. Loved the Liz wears her wedding dress the whole series! Surprised to discover Brian Gleeson is only 28. His perpetual frown made him look so much older."

Rebellion,"Fantastic Series, Excellent Cast","Cannot comprehend how I'm 5 years late finding this series. Diverting from the usual republican leaders, it was delightful viewing how others contributed towards the Irish rebellion. Little did we think, 100 years later, our island would still be divided. Great show, highly recommend."
Rebellion,Eye opening period drama.,"So I caught this tv series via Netflix. Very interesting period drama about the Irish revolutionary period. I've seen both Seasons. Season 2 was my favourite, it started to pick up for me in terms of storytelling pacing. The background score is good. It captures the emotion, sacrifice and the toll of the revolution perfectly."
Rebellion,Season 2 is a mess,"Season 1 was well written, well acted and because it has the frame of the 1916 rebellion there's plenty of natural tension driving the story.

Season 2 starts out with people we don't know bluntly telling us the plot points and drives of the characters. There's no subtlety at all. The tension in this season is the personal problems people need to solve that have nothing to do with the original story of the Easter Uprising.

I understand they may not have been able to get the original actors from season 1, so I can't fault them for that. But, I was hoping this season would be about the repercussions of the 1st season's actions by the characters.

I just believe the writing and the plot are much weaker in Season 2."
Rebellion,Irish rebellion very violent,"It is a good story, dramatically told.

But, I've read that indepence could have been easily achieved by asking for a public referendum. Freedom could have been achieved bloodlessly.

Also, as someone who knows the scripture of the bible, why was everyone not praying to God? The mother of Jesus is prayed to is in? Explainable."
Rebellion,Compelling drama,Thoroughly enjoyed this mini series. Well written. Well acted. Very informative. Treat yourself!

Skylanders Academy,Neat Cartoon Adaptation,"I have played all but a few of the Skylanders games (the one I have not played being Superchargers and the mobile entries), but I was surprised when I heard Activision and Netflix were teaming up to do a Skylanders cartoon.

Like most cartoon adaptations of video games, this is a spin-off separate from the games, as it has Spyro, Stealth Elf, and Eruptor, who, under the watchful eye of Master Eon and Jet-Vac, go on various adventures to stop foes like Kaos and the Doom Raiders, while learning important lessons about what it's like to be a Skylander.

The series is a good combination of adventure and comedy. While most of the characters have been recast, they did manage to get some of the VAs from the games to reprise their roles (especially Richard Horvitz, who voices Kaos). And Crash even makes an appearance (although he actually speaks, which can be good or bad for some viewers). It is a Netflix exclusive worth checking out if you are a fan of Skylanders, Spyro, or just want something new to watch."
Skylanders Academy,Better than you think,"I will admit first and foremost that while I personally have never played a Skylanders video game, I have played some of the older Playstation titles that some characters that appear in this show originate from.

So with this small knowledge of what the games are like, combined with the knowledge that most of Netflix's previous shows (even those made for kids) have been pretty decent in the past, I approached this cartoon with middle of the road expectations.

The first episode stole my interest right off the bat with some legitimately funny jokes, a musical earworm of a theme song and fantastic animation. At first the characters appear rather ordinary and uncomplex, but over the course of the show we learn more and more about them and they become far more compelling to watch.

After looking into the backgrounds of the creators; voice actors and writers of this show, it's obvious a lot of talented people have come into this show from all sorts of backgrounds, and that talent is not misguided or inappropriate, it all works in creating a special kind of animated children show that's elevated way above the level of quality we usually come to expect. Highly recommended."
Skylanders Academy,Good fun,"I watched this in Hebrew to improve my language skills, so I'm not really their target audience, but I actually ended up quite enjoying it. The voice acting by the Hebrew cast is really good. The animation is solid, better than a lot of modern kids shows. The story keeps the series moving and gradually, although sometimes annoying, I grew to quite like the characters, and some of the plot twists in the show are interesting and keep you watching.

The minor complaint would be that often the story is bit ridiculous, stuff often being 'convenient', but this could be considered as part of the humour of the show, which I think often knows that it's being stupid- it's just a bit of fun.

Decent tv show, especially if you're using it to improve language skills."

Skylanders Academy,Please make more seasons,My husband my son my daughter and I have watched the show from season 1 and we all really look forward to seeing season 4 and more can't stop rewatching have rewatched at least 500 times
Skylanders Academy,Why can't there be a season 4,Why can't there be a season 4 i love the episodes it never gets boring and I hate how left it on a cliffhanger I want to know what happens please.my sisters love it my dog even watches it I really want a season 4 it will be amazing you could look up skylanders on tick-tock and find the comments asking for a season 4. Why was it cancelled Please add a season 4 in I don't care how long it tackes to make I just want a season 4 please and trust me I went mad when I went through every episode and found out that there isn't a season 4.you could add spyros parents in season 4 as well I love the game. Please season 4.
Skylanders Academy,"Horrific writing, otherwise pretty good.","Is honestly a disgrace to the series. Just fixing the writing would make it amazing though. I've played all the Skylanders games except Imaginators, but that's honestly totally uninteresting and I'm only writing this because the review needs to be atleast 150 characters."
Skylanders Academy,Sad it's over!,Can't actually believe there won't be a series 4. Myself & my 8 year old son have really enjoyed watching this together. As well as been visually beautiful the storylines & characters were very enjoyable. Shame.
Skylanders Academy,I can't re-watch this often enough!,"I ain't a spring chicken, and next to grueling work my free time is limited. So I don't re-watch shows often. Amongst movies and series that I have re-watched more than twice are the likes of Better Off Ted, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Hot Fuzz and Transformers Animated. But Skylanders Academy came, and I found myself watching it for the third time just last month. And the show only came out half a year ago! Heck, I subscribed to Netflix for a month just to watch it. If you never heard about Skylanders - don't worry. While I love the games, knowing about the universe isn't required for you to enjoy the show. Everything will be explained, the rest are nice easter eggs for us fans. The core characters are expertly chosen - we have the cocky and self-assured dragon Spyro, playful but top of her class Stealth Elf, stickler for rules veteran Jet Vac, dependable but easily angered Eruptor and slightly loopy Pop Fizz. Rounding up the cast are the wise yet quirky Master Eon and his faithful assistant Hugo, and on the villain side, the ever-plotting wannabee supervillain Kaos and his long-suffering butler Glumshanks. Each episode is expertly written and while moving along the main plot, devotes an equal amount of time for a one-episode story and character development. The humor is excellent and has its own style - it isn't typical slapstick or lowbrow stuff you would expect from many kids' cartoon. For example, Kaos berates Glumshanks for collecting colorful stones which are actually his anxiety medication. Or the whole episode dedicated to how a without his beard, Eon cannot hold the attention of anyone for his rousing speeches - when Kaos's spell ends up transplanting the beard as the bald Portal Master's new hair. I honestly can't wait for the second season, and hope that the show comes out on DVD/BR, as this is a series I want to own as a hard-copy."
Skylanders Academy,This Show Is A Masterpiece 👌🏻🔥,This Show Is A Masterpiece I Like All The Character I Like The Story I Like The Dialogue And The Sinario Of This Show And It's So Disappointing To See This Show Not So Famous Thanks Gives To all The Actor And The Crow👌🏻🔥
Skylanders Academy,Great show,"This is a great show It has awesome characters, beautiful animation, and great stories If you like the games then you'll like this I recommend it"
Skylanders Academy,Please make a season 4,"I really love this series. One thing I wish is that there were more episodes in every season for me to rewatch until the next seasons come out. Rewatching them helps to build more understanding of what's going on, and the episodes are like a timeline so you have to watch every one.

Recommended for young Skylanders fans, and 16+"
Skylanders Academy,Love this show,My sister and me had a great time watching this show together.
Skylanders Academy,Ok show but 10 stars for Norm MacDonald as glumshanks,So cool to hear Norm when I'm watching kids shows with the little ones. It's a great thing
Skylanders Academy,Watch it because you enjoy it.,Comentario no disponible
Skylanders Academy,Unfinished,"When I saw the season 3 ending it was obvious that it was not finished. But after years we still haven't seen a season 4 or a movie that can conclude the story.

What is worse, Activison does not allow to be contacted.

This series made me want to play Spyro, but if support, for the cartoon and the game, does not exist, doubts come.

It may be because I love dragons, I liked this series even as an adult, many characters are well characterized. Of course I would have liked it more if there had been a real ending.

By truncating the series they have ruined it... as well as disappointing the audience."

Heartbreak High,The best representation of autism onscreen that I've ever seen.,"Finally, autistic actors are being casted to play autistic characters. This series was the first time I've ever seen myself authentically represented on-screen, the first time I've seen myself shown as anything other than a punchline or a cause for pity. I hope this is the start of change for representation of autistic people in media.

As an Australian teenager, a lot of the media I come across is heavily Americanized and not at all relatable, so this was definitely a welcome change. This is an incredibly candid and funny look into what modern adolescence in Australia is really like, and I'm looking forward to seeing more."
Heartbreak High,"As a gen z, yes.","As a gen z teen who watches all the latest I find myself cringing at a lot of teen shows nowadays. It's too 80s with the whole vibe, or painfully older than teen years. I wanted to hate this show but I think it's the best gen z rep I've seen. It just has so many true aspects to it of being a teen nowadays and even how they presented romance in the show for teen years. Wish we could have seen more to be honest, it's a show I would watch a few seasons worth if they came out but still loved it even without the extension. Good show and felt like someone from my generation helped write it , very relatable."
Heartbreak High,Surprisingly good,"I expected this to be another one of those poorly produced Netflix dramas that try to seem relatable to teenagers, but miserably fail at it. But I was surprised in many ways. Sure, it's still a pretty unrealistic portrayal of teenagers, but it had some nice parts. There are a variety of different stories in this series, some of them are pretty interesting. The characters themselves very interesting as well. The acting was surprisingly good too. Some of the comedy fell a little short and won't probably work in a few years, but nothing too bad. Sometimes I think the series was even making fun of today's teenage culture. I wish it had leaned more towards that, because it would have been a more interesting take. All in all: a good binge watch!"
Heartbreak High,Very relatable,"I have never seen an accurate representation of myself in any serie. Quinni was the first autistic girl I have seen accurately portrayed how it feels to be afab and autistic. Not the classic white boys like sheldon and sherlock. And to top it off, Quinni was actually played by an autistic actor! I finally felt really understood.

Not to even talk about the lgbt+ representation. For once one of the main characters was an amab nonbinary person of colour. I loved how diverse this cast and characters was.

I would definitely recommend you watch this series if you want to see yourself represented. I'm sure at least one of the characters are relatable for you."
Heartbreak High,Wanted to hate this so much....,"I started off absolutely hating this reboot of one of my favorite TV shows. I thought it was badly written, over the top woke bs and I was absolutely gonna vote this down and give it a one star review.

I continued watching the episodes and started to realize the damn thing was growing on me...

The writing wasn't great in many areas and I cringed more than a few times with some of the lines that were written.

But honestly, I have to say I got to the end of the last episode and wanted another season.

I am still in love with Peter Rivers as much today as I was back in the 90's...I loved him more than I loved Drazic.

My favorite character without a doubt is Darren.

PLEASE GIVE US ANOTHER SEASON."
Heartbreak High,Actually autistic representation!!!,"A show that actually listens to autistic voices instead of suppressing them. This is the first time I've ever related to a character so much. Quinni is amazing and so is Chloe Hayden. Episode ""Angeline"" is literally the truth of what it is like being autistic in the modern world and the challenges we face when it comes to ableism. The fact that Chloe got a say in the character, that is the future! <3. After the last few years of ableism the community has faced this is exactly what we needed. It's heartwarming. The performance is so amazing and I can't fault it one bit. It makes me proud to be autistic and helps me feel more accepted!"
Heartbreak High,Really well-done high school drama with a lot of great storylines.,"Season One: 9/10

Themes: High School, Drama, Friendship, Romance, Lgbtq+, Gay, Lesbian, Non-Binary, Asexuality, Sexual Assault, Autism, Sex Education, Police Violence, Parties, Popularity, Troubled Teens & Australian.

Review: I was very pleasantly surprised with this series and I can honestly say I was invested. I thought the acting was great, the storyline was well-crafted and the writing was pretty ace too. All around, it was well done! The characters were also well-developed and they were all interesting in their own way. Almost all of them annoyed me in some way or another, but that also made them seem more real, I guess. I definitely have characters and storylines I prefer over others, but generally the whole series intrigued and entertained me! It was fun, emotional and surprising.

Top four characters: 1) Darren Rivers, 2) Harper McLean, 3) Douglas 'Ca$h' Piggott and 4) Quinni Gallagher-Jones."
Heartbreak High,The kids are alright for now,Comentario no disponible
Heartbreak High,Better than Sex Education,"Absolutely obsessed with this show. It definitely gave me Sex Education vibes but in my opinion it's even better. I could relate to Amerie so well, Ca$h and Darren and Quinnie and Malakai were such amazing and loveable, relatable characters (even if they were frustrating at times, but that's just what made it so much more realistic). Loved the continuous, not really foreseeable storyline between Harper and Amerie, it always kept the plot even more interesting and made it impossible to stop watching. Every single character beought something important to the table and the whole show is just so so up to date and therefore an incredibly good, important remake that touches all the right topics!"
Heartbreak High,The reboot,"As a massive fan of the original series in the 90s and am very happy that the powers that be deemed it was worthy of a reboot cause it really is.

Now to the fans of the original that think maybe this is too woke or cashing in on political correctness you are wrong the original show tackled controversial issues that were relevant at the time same as what they are doing here, it's a big thumbs up from me so far but I do hope they have some light hearted episodes let's not make it all grim. Was really good to see Scott Major back as Rivers still trying to work out is it the same guy Or a new man."
Heartbreak High,AMAZING!! SEASON 2 NEEDED!!,"I watched this show not really knowing what to expect, but I loved it and binged it all in two days!! There's someone in it that anyone can relate to, the representation is so so well done. The accurate autism portrayal by an ACTUALLY autistic actress is HUGE, and i'm sure it is a MASSIVE step in the film industry becoming more inclusive, correctly. The acting by everyone is incredible, and I couldn't believe that for most of the cast this was their first break! I can't wait to see what heartbreak high will bring for the actors' futures as they are all so incredibly talented. Hopefully a season 2 is in the making, I can't wait for it!!"
Heartbreak High,"Lots of laughs, enjoyed it","I kinda expected a Sex Education knock-off. And in some ways it is. In the beginning it is actually a bit distracting. But with every episode it actually takes a step away and - as many have pointed out - feels a bit like Euphoria instead. Considering that some people feel like Euphoria is too heavy and SE a bit too quirky Heartbreak High rests in the middle. Last episode is a bit messy but I can overlook that considering some great perfomances along the way (Quinni and Ca$h especially, the kind of represenation that is so desperatly needed). Shows like this are really great to binge. Just saw that it got renewed - Excited for more."
Heartbreak High,Overtly Hypersexualised Rubbish,"I am a Heartbreak High fan from way back. But I'm certainly not a fan of the current version though!

At first, the casting looked promising but it descended pretty quickly into debauched and overdone sexualisation of teens with every girl and guy seemingly gay or bi and into anything that moved. Honestly? Whoever produced this clearly consulted with a 13 year old and retold their wet dream in the form of this series. It was infantile, fantastical and utterly debased.

Drugs were free (Westies doing coke? Yeah right..) with every character seemingly into them except the token Autistic character who was apparently on medication anyway. (Fear not, they had plenty of stereotypes to hang off her as well which was just appalling).

As someone working in schools, I laughed at this embarrassing representation of a modern high school.

Unfortunately, it's very apparent in this reboot that today's tv writers are hanging off American tropes and trying so hard to be edgy that they end up limp wristed.

This series is not only disappointing but absolutely cringeworthy."
Heartbreak High,8.5 Great Aussie Series,"Amazing show, funny, emotional, great three-dimensional characters that highlight just how diverse the Australian population is. More realistic than Euphoria, think it will definitely appeal to fans of Sex Education (but not as graphic so okay for younger teens ~15). Really captured the experience of growing up in Australia. The casting was amazing, and the diversity in the cast really let the writers explore so many different Aussie experiences, especially loved seeing the Aboriginal representation actually done well. Great Aussie music too (The Divinyls, and strawberry kisses were fun throwbacks), will be devo'd if this isn't renewed ;) want season 2 asap."
Heartbreak High,Great Aussie addition,"I don't often write reviews, but I felt this series needed some serious vindication.

Firstly, I've never seen the original so this was completely fresh for me.

Secondly, I think the comparisons to 'Sex Education' (which I'm a huge fan of) are just lazy; Sex Education did not invent the archetype of hormonal teenagers, I mean come on 🙄

The acting is solid, the stories are entertaining and reasonably unique and the inclusion, at least for me, did not feel tokenistic in the slightest; Australia, particularly in inner city suburbs, is hugely diverse, and this show provides an 'accurate' (as much as a tv show can be) and entertaining portrayal of modern teen life.

Give it a go, and if you can spare yourself the unfair comparisons to other shows that strike a passing resemblance, you might actually enjoy yourself."
Heartbreak High,What an absolute banger,"We need more good Aussie shows like this, they're relatable, deep, funny and has so much diversity. To the LGBTQIA's, indigenous, disabilities and the personalities. It honestly could impact all of Australia and the way things work.

The stories never slowed, it always kept me guessing. Some characters I fell in love with, especially the ships, and some characters I was annoyed/repulsed by, with every episode my opinions kept changing.

I love the use of our Aussie slang and just getting to hear our accent on tv again was just so refreshing. We need more shows like this, more Aussie authentic shows."
Heartbreak High,It has it's flaws but the positives outweigh them,"A decently accurate representation of teens in Australia with a great cast of flawed characters that you find yourself being really invested in. They all have their own depth and no one feels like an unnecessary addition. Sex is a main theme but it is never shown or referenced in a way that feels unnecessary or gratuitous. It is well paced and written, nothing feels unearned.

Good balance of funny and serious, found myself both laughing and nearly crying.

Yeah some of the acting isn't 100% but these are young actors and you can feel them get better and better as the season goes on.

Hope it gets a season two."
Heartbreak High,H8ers' Gonna Hate Bu' Sisterhood Will Stay,"Susan Sarandon recently formally came out as bi.

This show came out right after the news and somehow let me see bits of the classic T&L, and also, tributes to too many legendary movies and shows.

Tons of sexual and gender identities will be explored and portrayed. Characters of different ethnic and racial backgrounds are displayed in a ""light-hearted way"" that no one gets ""affirmative-action-ish"" educational back story that ""they are this different because of their heritage"" etc., which made the show easily jumps into a world more accessible to audiences from different backgrounds, in my opinion. Somewhere impartial, not super eurocentric or usa-centric or Aussie-centric (if thats a real word).

To be honest, any descriptive words I want to use to ""amway"" the show will give away the suspense. But if you wanna have a weekend binging a good coming of age Aussie school drama with a bunch of woman-performer-only good music, come join me, let's make this show a 2nd season BABY!!"
Heartbreak High,Actually pretty good,"Born in 1983, i am a huge fan of the original series. I expected the worst from this reboot, but actually really enjoyed it. I think it's well done and represents stuff that kids deal with nowadays. The only thing I'm missing, compared to the old show, is a few storylines of adults. I mean us 80s kids are DESPERATE to know how Rivers ended up back in the city he deeply hated and apparently married someone that isn't Sam!! Him driving into the sunset with teacher Sam, was just so satisfying for our teenage hearts. We need answers! But overal, very entertaining show, definitely interested to see a second season."
Heartbreak High,Review from a teenager during the original series,"Synopsis ¨Heartbreak 22¨ follows a almost identical format to the original series, but very current and updated.

Analysis: reboots generally are interesting. The tap into a brand, with a dedicated fanbase they can be tricky when it comes to the reactions of old fans. Personally as a 84 born kid I really wanted to like it, but there was a bit of concern. After watching the first two episodes it's easy to admit how well it is done. Realistic, fun and captures the spirit of Heartbreak High very well.

The great thing about the series though is that is it just as relatable a the originals. One warning the 3rd and 4th episode are really not great, they go into an Americanized format of a high school drama and bank only on the sex. Don't worry after a de-tour around the 5th episodes it pick up again.

Story: all the dramas and shananigans that teenagers go through during the high school

Dialogue: 10/10 fantastic Costume / Decor: 10/10 as realistic as can be

Anything else: very excited to see to series unfold as it is going. And I hope this series with catch on with a whole new generation. Coz that is where the real success is measured."
Heartbreak High,My guilty pleasure,"Heartbreak High is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys compelling and authentic teen dramas. The show's talented cast of characters are diverse, complex, and relatable, and their journeys through the challenges of high school life are depicted with honesty and sensitivity.

The show tackles important issues like bullying and friendship in a way that feels both timely and timeless, and its exploration of the ups and downs of adolescence will resonate with audiences of all ages.

As a remake of the classic 90s series, Heartbreak High does justice to its predecessor while also bringing a fresh and modern perspective to the material. Overall, this is a show that will make you laugh, cry, and feel deeply invested in the lives of its characters."
Heartbreak High,Loved loved loved it!,Comentario no disponible
Heartbreak High,Boring and predictable season 2,"It's cute, it was cute at first. But then they had to make a season 2. Amerie is really not a likeable character, she's super selfish and a brat, with zero logic to her actions. She does whatever whenever and lands everyone around her in trouble, every single time! The characters around her are also kinda stupid and shallow... Were we like this when we were teenagers!? I sure Hope not!! There's a lot of sexual fluidity: boy loves boy loves girl loves boy loves boy who loves boys and girls who love girls and then boys. Teenagers discovering their identities. But the story is boring in that second season. Save your time, skip it."
Heartbreak High,Trash with zero substance,"This is so embarrassing, I was a big fan of the original Heartbreak High but is just utter trash. If it genuinely does reflect how teenagers are today, I feel deeply saddened, but does the plot actually contain anything more than the slutty sex lives of teenagers?

Even the relationships between these teens have zero substance. After watching several episodes I still don't really know anything about most of these characters, which in my opinion is poor writing and makes it really hard to care about any of them.

Boring boring boring.. I don't feel I'm being judgemental as I actually still enjoy a lot of younger adult or teenage viewing series."
Heartbreak High,A die hard original heartbreak high fan,"It's good but not as good as the original. Although you do see a original cast member in a couple scenes I wish you saw much more of him and other original cast members as that's what I think it's missing.

It needs some of the old heartbreak high with a few more original cast members and the same flare added to the modern spin if it had that it would be perfect. It lacks certain things the original had. All together the show is ok but it really just needs some more of the original series added into it to make it better.

I must say I love the fact we see rivers but we need a whole life more of him."

Delhi Crime,"Don't Miss It At Any Cost !!! Delhi Crime Is Bloody, Gruesome And Yet An Eye-Opener","This is the first time I will be writing review of a web-series as it has provoked me to write about the terrible incident. Delhi Crime was an eye-opener of the famous Nirbhaya case which is intriguing and disturbing.

Based on the horrific incident of 2012 Delhi gang-rape of a 23 year old girl in a moving bus, which rocked the entire nation, Delhi Crime is the chronical of the detailed investigation carried out by Delhi Police and the effort spent in nabbing the 6 accused involved in the crime within 5 days.

Directed, researched (for 4 years) and created by Richie Mehta along with Laurence Bowen and Toby Bruce, Delhi Crime is one of most dark and disturbing movie I have ever seen. The seven episode series will keep you hooked to the detailed investigations starting from a wake-up call at 2 AM to the DCP of South District, Delhi Police, Vartika Chaturvedi, informing about the bleeding and naked victims, lying along streets during a cold-wintry night of Delhi, police officers travelling across the remote areas of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jharkhand to locate the accused till the confession made by Nirbhaya herself. Each and every scene has executed appropriately and accurately.

Delhi Crime has been told from the Delhi Police's point of view - how their lives got impacted along with their family during those 5 days of strenuous investigation, working endlessly at the police station and not even being allowed to go back home. The web-series details out the struggles and challenges faced by the cops mentally, physically and financially (yes ... there were budget constraint even during this critical time). Few scenes do stand out - the interrogation scene between Delhi Police and remorseless Jai Singh, who was proud of his misdeed, the scene where a police call-operator wants to leave early but is always held by the DCP, the hospital scene where the doctor tells DCP about the deteriorating condition of Nirbhaya and the scene where the judge finally comes directly to record the confession of Nirbhaya. Hats off to the director for making it bold and blunt. Delhi crime was also an eye-opener for the story on the male victim, who was being sympathized by many till now. As rightly pointed out by a police officer, he could have fought against attackers in the moving bus. The web-series also shows his willingness to be in limelight by giving interviews to media, despite being warned by the DPS twice that it might spoil their investigation. Unfortunately, the media in our country is one piece of crap who would go to any extent to sell their stuff without even understanding the grimness of the situation.

Delhi Crime boast off some strong technical support. I should start with an outstanding editing work. The background score is haunting and yet mesmerizing. The cinematography is brilliant, portraying a real-life crime with aplomb. Screenplay is fantastic, though it becomes little sluggish towards the 5th and 6th episode.

Coming to the performances, it is Shefali Shah who will make you believe in the tough investigation carried out by the Delhi Police. Inspired by real-life IPS officer, Chhaya Sharma (former DCP South District, Delhi Police), Shefali Shah lives and breathes the character of Vartika Chaturvedi. Shefali is complimented by Rajesh Tailang (Mirzapur fame), her long-time co-worker, who stands tall with her at each and every moment. The actors playing the role police officers on field were equally marvelous.

On the whole, Delhi Crime is not easy watch but it will expose the harsh reality of what happened on that fateful night and it will definitely make you angry. Go for it ...MIND-BLOWING 4.5/5"
Delhi Crime,A crime from the point of view of the police,"It's just great. The show shows the other perspective of the actual Happenings. The media just showed us the view point of the victims's family, the series showed us from the perspective of the investigators of the case. Thank You Netflix and Richie Mehta for making this series."
Delhi Crime,So gripping and acting is just wow,"These actors are the new gems of Indian Content. Wow, their acting is just amazing. Thanks Netflix for focusing on Quality over quantity. Watch it, You will love it!"
Delhi Crime,Can't be missed. One of the best crime series.,"Delhi Crime is no easy watch. In fact, it should come with a trigger warning. The show follows Delhi Police and how they nabbed the 6 accused in the unsettling 2012 gangrape case that shook the capital. The series is, at once, an unputdownable watch but an exhausting experience."
Delhi Crime,Will make you angry and overwhelmed at the same time,I was very angry and overwhelmed at the same time when watching this. It's an amazing take on the real heinous act of inhuman treatment and ghastly Ugly reality of our so called society which holds their values to the core but don't know how to act on them. My guts were trolling when this happened and again when i was watching this. I really hope that such demonic creatures never come into existence and the accused get the justice they deserve asap.
Delhi Crime,True determination,"I am on episode 5, its 2am on a working day and I aint stopping till im done with the series, not that I cant stop watching but that I wont stop. If the Delhi Police worked around the clock to bring those assholes to justice, them Im staying up to honour that, just need to figure out what to tell the boss in the morning.....on a serious note, this is one hellavu show, it has everything from the most amazing moments of sheer determination to bring a**holes to justice, to sheer strength of sacrifice not to mention some relationships are funny as hell. The acting is superb, the pace is intense. Its waaaay better then most of the crime dramas out there. I highly recommend it."
Delhi Crime,Lots of respect and our Police department,"Very thought provoking.. Lots of respect and our Police department. Maybe a little slow. But to get the true the experiences they go through, it's necessity. Casting and acting is superb. Need more shows like this to erase the misconceptions of our heros."
Delhi Crime,Strong drama #,"A must watch:

Compelling viewing.
Let down by lack of subtitles throughout.


This sort of thick accent (and I am of Indian origin) was near impossible to understand. Producers (Netflix) should have insisted on subtitles for the Hindi as well as the ""English"" dialogue!"
Delhi Crime,"A fascinating show which is brilliant in all aspects, difficult but tremendously rewarding","Delhi Crime is a phenomenal film series which works both as a taut suspense thriller, a touching and heartbreaking human story, and a hard-hitting social drama. The show, which narrates the investigation following an unimaginably brutal gang rape perpetrated against a young woman, exposes images of pure, horrific barbarism in the midst of a democratic state which doesn't have enough enforcement of law and order. But then it shows that there's still hope. This hope does not necessarily come from the country's lawmakers and political authorities as it does from ordinary citizens and especially the selfless service of groups of devoted individuals who work for the police and who give their lives to make justice prevail.

The series is a wonderful commentary on the restricted budgetary resources at the disposal of those who are in charge of the case, namely the police; the limited manpower assigned to them; and the pressure, both political, public, as well as from the media, which stands in the way of proper investigation of the incident in question. The show is particularly critical of the media, its enraging tendency to resort to fake news and click baits in times when not much information is available, with some members of the media being actually portrayed as true, pathetic scavengers. But then, the importance of public discourse and protest is asserted all through, and then again, the hard work of true police officers is there to save the day.

That's where our heroine, DCP Vartika Chaturvedi, is placed. And it is through her dedication and perseverance that this story moves forward. Her selfless commitment to the mission affects and drives everyone around. The film places emphasis on the terrific work of the police, and while it is not an easy watch the whole time through, with some harrowing, horrifying portions, it actually manages to be quite inspiring and uplifting. Technically the film is superb - the cinematography is top-notch, the sound is fantastic, and the film is tremendously realistic and credible all the way through. The dialogue is tremendously authentic, and the setting provides the viewers with a fascinating insight of the Indian police and its daily practice.

Shefali Shah, one of India's finest actresses, delivers a powerhouse performance with not a single false note. Her extraordinarily charismatic and imperious presence never takes away from her constant understanding of the human core that drives this character, resulting in a true portrait of strength and compassion. Just an expression in her eyes speaks more than a million words. The way she captures Vartika's tough exterior, soft inside, and steadfast determination, is one of the great assets of this phenomenal show. But while she leads the film, she is one of a host of brilliant actors, all of whom make Delhi Crime one of the greatest treasures of Indian filmmaking, which the country can only be proud of."
Delhi Crime,10 stars to Delhi Police Actually,Show is fast paced in start but slowly looses its pace. But overall really very good show a must watch. Hats off to Delhi police for the dedication shown if they have actually done it as shown in the show. Don't believe everything which media shows.
Delhi Crime,A breathtaking crime series. A true masterpiece! Pure poetry.,"This was by far one of the best crime series I've seen. Not only do you get an insight into the everyday lives of this mega cosmopolitan task force and the challenges it faces in economic terms, there's a is a dynamic of hopeful optimism poignantly portrayed and conveyed in a way rarely seen. What's more one gets a first hand hands on look at India and it's diverse economic and complex political structure. The script is masterfully orchestrated and the constant intertwine of Hindi and English is simply fascinating. Language plays a major roll and is definitely well used to depict the various layers of social and economic strata in that bustling nation. Aside from it holding high standards as a crime series it really was extraordinarily educational to say the least. Based on a true story or perhaps several of them this is a must for all that feel in some way social justice is out of reach. It isn't if it is found such a struggling and vast nation like India. Kudos to all involved for a magnificent team effort in producing such a beautiful and gripping series. Top notch."
Delhi Crime,Good 1st season but the 2nd one average,"I'd give it 7.4/10 collectively for the first 2 seasons. 1st season was too good with minimal flaws but the 2nd season looked too flat. 1st season gripped the audience till the end of it with 7 episodes but the 2nd one despite having just 5 episodes looked a bit stretched especially after the killing of the 2 men in the pronounced group. 1st season looked more realistic but the 2nd one was entirely fictional and it was just an inspiration from the infamous kachha-baniyaan group. 2nd season had unnecessary and comparatively enlarged melodrama of the families of Policemen. A lilliputian trip of Mussoorie helped 2 of the prime suspects of one of the most gruesome series of murders cut and run from the Police Station. Leave Delhi Police aside, will any Police of the world keep the prime suspects unattended like this even for a minute who aren't even handcuffed? The DP gets a call from a PCO but it was proved to be an unneeded deliberate scene as who called, nobody knows even by the end of the season. Also, the DCP just talks in English? Wasn't that unreal for Indian Police? DCP is a prestigious and quite a high rank in Police but English that too everywhere with everyone even with the DN tribal people? Anyway, even with the lousy plot and writing, the acting of the cast was top-notch. Shefali Shah, Rajesh Tailang, the main female conspirer, and a special mention to that guy who played the role of Chaddha, all excellent acting. Also, I think it was too dark, I had to increase the contrast to see scenes properly. There could be more scenes shot in daylight. Overall, I'll give 8.9/10 for the first season and 5.9/10 for the second."

Delhi Crime,Class of its own!,"One of the best series India has ever produced. Quite beautifully covered the sequence and very amazingly added the essence of suspense without troubling the crust of the story.

Brilliant work by Shefali Shah. Her talent has been exposed after a very long time. Quite definitely a under rated actress.

This series definitely will make all the youth and youngsters to join Indian Police force.

Definitely everybody should watch it out!!!!

Three cheers for the team for such brilliant performance!"
Delhi Crime,Investigating a real crime in New Delhi which shook India,"In 2012 a young couple boarded a night bus in the Indian capital; he was beaten but she was brutally raped by the six men on board. They were then dumped, naked, from the moving bus. We aren't shown any of that; we just see then boarding the bus before switching to the police vehicle which does to the scene. Pressure on the police is very high with public, press and politicians demanding a rapid resolution to the case. Officers led by DCP Vartika Chaturvedi search to find the bus and its driver. The hunt for others, particularly two only known by nicknames won't be as easy.

I would heartily recommend this series; it deals with a crime that shook India and was reported around the world in a sensitive way. We do not have to see the crime to know how vile it was; descriptions of what happened to the young woman are disturbing enough. The investigation is interesting to watch as it shows the difficulties the police face as the struggle to get results quickly with limited resources. The series is shot on location and looks great; capturing the contrasts in the city. The cast is impressive; both those playing major characters and those in smaller roles.

These comments are based on watching the series in Hindi with English subtitles."
Delhi Crime,Gripping Show.,"What a portrayal to a heart wrenching crime this country has witnessed. Phenomenal direction and a glimpse on how Police department works. Binge watch, eagerly waiting for 2nd season."
Delhi Crime,Season 2 disappointed - Season 1 was great,"Why Shefali's character talks too much English. I can understand may be sometimes but with alomst everyone she talks in English. Which was very unrealistic. In last episode, her daughter was speaking Hindi but Shefali kept on responding to her in English only. Also the storyline wasn't as gripping as the first part.

Also the way they have releaved the culprits wasn't justified.

Good part is few episodes or else it would have felt very boring.

They missed it this time. Best of luck for the next season.

So ultimately season 2 isn't good compared to season 1 or any other crime thriller. Frankly there were no thrilling moments."
Delhi Crime,In depth view of 2012 Nirbhaya case,This tv series was more on Delhi Police views.Much different then the what media had reported.The way Delhi Police chase all of the victim and captured.Also the side of politics and media.Thank you Netflix for making such tv series. Acting is superb by all the cast.
Delhi Crime,Perfect investigation in a horrible crime,"Season One is based on investigations in Nirbhaya gangrape case. Series relied upon real events and facts surrounding the investigations. Nirbhaya was brutally gangraped and her boyfriend was assaulted on a moving bus in winter of December-16. There were six culprits. Everything happened in the dark of the night. So to recreate the chain of events, to find out the bus and to identify the victims were very difficult tasks. But Delhi police under the leadership of DCP Vartika Chaturvedi crack this case in five straight days. She forms her own investigating team and each team works on minute details and leads. Though there are some really powerful performances, by and large, all cast did their job nicely and fit into their respective characters perfectly. Characterisation was so good that you can very well predict how one would behave in a given situation. Writer did include some drama by using subplots involving families of cops and some politics of Delhi. This does interrupt the buildup of tension. But overall, series is written very nicely and most the time it does not lose grip over the main plot."
Delhi Crime,Wonderful,I knew Shifali Shah would do a fantastic job in the series and she did exceptionally good acting. It was made brilliantly. Screen Play was fantastic.
Delhi Crime,Great!,"Season one would be very hard to top but season two came pretty close. This series reminds me of the original Day of the Jackal. Slow, methodical detective work. With the exception of the tech guy these officers are working with the most basic tools and they still get the job done. English dubbing is excellent where the subtitles seem a bit off. After season two I think they should make action hero figures of this team! Culturally worlds apart but still very engaging for this US viewer. All the b-roll of Mumbai is actually a treat. Not sure where it could go from here but I'm glad that we had seasons one and two."
Delhi Crime,I would give it a better grade but I found it a bit one sided,"As a procedural it is very good. Great directing, good acting, a very gripping story based on real events. It is so interesting that I watched the whole thing in one day. My main issue with the series is that sometimes it looks like if a PR agency wrote the script to glorify Delhi Police. Mind you, I know nothing about Delhi and their police, but I doubt any police force in the world is as holly as the one in this series."
Delhi Crime,"Delhi Crime, Season 2 review and rating","Season 1 was very well done, and even though we knew the story (being based on the infamous and tragic Nirbhaya case), it was taut.

Season 2 is also taut for 3-3.5 of the 5 episodes. But because it is fiction (as the modern version of the infamous past Kachha-Baniyan gang), they have a hard time coming up with a way the police can track any member of the new gang. Suddenly in ep. 4, the police magically get the mobile number of one of the gang members. They show some unexplained scene for about 10 seconds, after which the police IT guy gets a gang member's name and mobile number! This sleight of hand in the script, totally lost it for me: if you can do such sleight of hand, then no crime thriller will be credible (and that after being led down the garden path of a taut credible thriller for about 70% of the show), will not be worth spending one's valuable time on, and will be the death of the genre. Furthermore, in ep. 5, they subsequently show some other very unrealistic events, it seems in an attempt to hurriedly bring the show to a conclusion, that puts further dents into the overall story. Also, they could have shown the police consulting a psychologist to determine what could have led a person to commit such horrific crimes against rich elderly people (psychopath personality along with how that may have developed could have been one explanation), but there was no such reveal. Instead the police DSP (the main character played by Shefali Shah) just ends with a weak (to paraphrase): ""Even the criminal can't answer the question of why they committed such crimes"". What a cop out and what a damp squib of an ending! If you can't finish well, then the whole endeavor is a waste. And wastes the viewer's time.

BTW, IMDB really needs to separate the ratings of different seasons of a show, as they can be such different animals, and it is misleading to the viewing public if the good rating for a good season falsely bolsters the rating for a poor one, and vice versa."
Delhi Crime,Life in the police force,"As much as the show is willing to show the audience the gruesome side of the ongoing and unfortunately, increasing crimes, the series also cover a side that is hardly shown in most crime fiction/non-fictions!

The life of a cop is not easy and neither is that of a citizen who is witnessing an endless phase of monstrosity. The show balances these two aspects well and gives the audience a well scripted package that lets us be a part of both of these worlds.

Season 1 is based on a true story while season 2, although picked from real events takes on a fictional path to portray an event which shakes us from the very core.

Acting is superb along with the direction and cinematography. It is a must watch series."
Delhi Crime,"A Series that you do not want to miss. A long-awaited series with amazing direction, casting, acting and all that you want to witness. Out of the World Series!","My eyes were glued to the screen both when it came to season 1 and season 2. At times, series makers or directors of an artistic work tend to drift apart in the second season but the dedication and the plot that has consistently nailed the suspense, links, facts, and all the spice that is needed to make this piece of work an amazing success has left me speechless. The team really needs a medal from the leaders of India for giving such a marvellous account of reality and how our police force overcomes the odds to sustain their personal life and solve the most gruesome crimes in our country. Yes, everyone does make faults, but these records shed a light into the justice system of India and although there are people of unstable minds and because of the sufferings that they face, they tend to become anti-social elements in the society, but our police force and especially those officers who stand for the right side even if they stand alone, need to be saluted for their courage and guts of such brilliance. You want to know how gems of our country in our capital city solve such deadly crimes? Then connect to Netflix at once, and see that justice is not dead in our country and that officers of such magnanimous courage exist too. Jai Hind! Jai Bharat!"

Making a Murderer,Are the Authorities watching the same confession tapes as we are?,"I've been binge watching this and I'm halfway thru season 2 and all I can say is I'm thoroughly disgusted with the cops, prosecutors, judges, jurors all of them. All one needs to do is watch the very 1st time Brendan's so-called confession tape was aired in the series! That CHILD had NO CLUE what the interrogators were talking about nor what they wanted him to say. This boy was, no IS so innocent, that when they started their LEADING questions regarding ""what happened around her head area""...after a long bout of silence he responds quote: ""I CUT HER HAIR?"". That is how innocent and non-violent Brendan is. That the first thing he could think of ON HIS OWN was a freaking HAIRCUT!!! Those interrogators were SO frustrated by his obvious lack of knowledge of what happened to the poor woman that they announced for all of us to see THAT THEY TOLD HIM she was shot in the head. Haircut to a Bullet in the Brain. Despicable. Wisconsin is full of corrupt cops, prosecutors, state attorneys, forensic analysts, and judges...in at least TWO COUNTIES. SHAME ON YOU!"
Making a Murderer,OMG!,"This documentary is insane! The best true crime documentary out there. It purely sheds light on the TRUTH of this nightmare of a case. Its infuriating to say the least. The American criminal justice system is SO corrupt, twisted, and flat out wrong for convicting Steven and Brenden to life for a crime they did not commit. EVERYONE needs to watch this documentary and be angry at how they were 100% framed.

unbelievable."
Making a Murderer,Unbelievable true story.,After watching this I will never set foot in the State of Wisconsin. What was done to this man was a fate worse than death. I am normally a supporter of the police but not in WI.
Making a Murderer,Disturbing,You need to watch this to see what are the autorities capable to do to protect them self
Making a Murderer,Haunting; Unbelievable,"It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. The view of this work from 30,000 feet is perhaps that it is a beautiful but tragic depiction of the powerful versus the powerless in the context of the American criminal justice system, and a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of when we believe the ends justify the means. The view on the ground - from a very intimate front row seat in Steven Avery's hometown of Manitowoc, WI - is that one man likely endured not one, but two of the most egregious injustices imaginable.

One thing that sets this series apart from previous shows in this genre (like NPR's Serial) is that the producers never once make an appearance on camera, nor does the viewer ever hear their voices, at least not in a literal sense. Instead, they rely on interviews, court proceedings, news clips, and telephone and video recordings to tell the story, often against the backdrop of the Avery's family compound. In a simple and clean way, the series is beautifully shot. And the story itself... unbelievable. But even the most reasonable, even skeptical viewer will have to grapple with the theories put forward. Theories that would seem a reach at best if it weren't for the overwhelming hard evidence unfolding, on film, right before your eyes.

I started out by saying that it was hard to describe how moving this documentary was, and I actually found myself transitioning through the same emotional states (albeit to a much lesser degree) that the key figures seemed to experience: from shock and disbelief to anger and ultimately to a sense of despair.

To me, what separates television and film that constitutes true ""art"" from that which is merely entertaining, is that it reveals something perhaps not so obvious but nonetheless true about human nature or the human experience. This easily surpasses that standard, but what makes it particularly chilling is that this is not a carefully constructed fictional plot designed to pull our heart strings. This actually happened. And it happened to real a person. To a real family."
Making a Murderer,A deep look into the terrible American justice system.,"This is one of the best documentaries ever created and a must-watch for everybody. The story is so insane and unbelievable that you would think this is a piece of fictional work, but it is not.

The only thing that could have been made a bit better is the episode running-time, sometimes the episodes feel a bit too long.

--9 out of 10 stars--"
Making a Murderer,More addictive than chocolate.,"I should have been in bed 5 hours ago but I can't stop watching the new chapter of the Avery Saga. The miscarriage of justice is frighteningly insurmountable. Being a screenwriter, if this were a movie I was going to write, I would never have been able to use this plot. I wouldn't have believed an audience would accept such a series of ludacris events like the mishandling and planting of evidence, unethical prosecutorial actions and the total and complete lack of ability to self examine their actions, due to fear. Fear because they've fully committed to their guilty story and if found innocent, how bad they'll look."
Making a Murderer,Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse,"This documentary is incredible. It may seem a bit one sided but if you look at the list of people at the end who declined to be interviewed you will see why. You can't begrudge the producers for the other side not cooperating. That being said, the outcome is not very surprising. If you've paid any attention to America's justice system ..... ever ....you would understand that cops and judges are above the law and they can do whatever they want and they have zero accountability. This series just solidified that. Everyone is going to act angry and appalled but then never actually do anything about it. And it will continue and the ""good ol' boys"" will continue trampling on our basic ""freedoms and liberties."" Yay USA!! *insert exaggerated eye roll here*"
Making a Murderer,Series Pilot Seemingly Riddled with Baseless Assumptions and Flawed Reasoning.,"As far as I was personally able to ascertain, the series pilot seemed so densely packed with a plethora of baseless assumptions, and heavily riddled with flawed reasoning skills, to the point to which I felt intellectually compelled to abandon all plans of ever watching the rest of the first season, after viewing just one episode, being completely and utterly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of questionable conclusions. Since I do not particularly enjoy posting spoilers, I hereby spare the reader their rather lengthy list; suffice is it to say, however, that they should be straightforwardly apparent to anyone viewing the pilot with a critical eye, through an objective lens.

Given its sky-high mark on this very site, along with a whole host of awards, won at various film festivals, I can only assume that the production eventually rewarded those that were psychologically able to muster or soldier through it, despite the constant onslaught of logical fallacies and unsound arguments permeating its first episode, for their enormous amount of patience and martyr-like resilience, as a cool morning breeze delighting heated young lovers after an exhaustingly arduous night of passion; personally, I found its powers of inference and intellectual prowess significantly less impressive.

Regardless of its ultimate truth value or popularity, a bad start or flawed pilot constitutes an unpardonable sin in matters of film making, for precisely this very reason: deterring potential viewers from ever engaging the movie or series; this is particularly relevant in a capitalist world of sales and marketing, where books are de facto judged by their proverbial cover; or, in this case, by their prologue.

Not being especially fond of posting low marks on productions I personally deem or perceive as somewhat subpar, I am thereby content with offering this hopefully constructive criticism, in good faith, with the intent of being received as such."

Making a Murderer,The best true crime legal documentary ever made,"Making a Murderer documents the true story of Steven Avery, sent to prison under questionable circumstances, exonerated on DNA evidence 18 years later, and accused of murder shortly thereafter under equally questionable circumstances.

MaM, ten hours long, is gripping throughout. The story is revealed chronologically, paced so perfectly to leave the viewer gasping at regular intervals, yet never feeling manipulated. But make no mistake: the filmmakers do have an opinion. And by the end of MaM, it is an opinion you will share.

The comparisons to gems like Paradise Lost and The Jinx are inevitable. Up until now, Paradise Lost represented the pinnacle of the genre; MaM tells its story similarly, yet surpasses PL. Where The Jinx, an otherwise excellent documentary, left me with a bad taste, feeling that the truth played second fiddle to its filmmakers' ambitions, MaM never focuses on its creators. The drama is narrated only by the players, the argument made convincingly by historical footage, media and police manipulation made plain not by rhetoric, but by the simple evidence provided by context.

Avery's story, as presented in MaM, is a horrifying story that leaves one infuriated at law enforcement, politicians, and news media. Not generally one for righteous indignation, this was the first series I've ever watched from which I had to take regular breaks out of sheer rage. Avery's story is not a pleasant or uplifting one. But it is as well-told as any I've seen."
Making a Murderer,Great entertainment but nothing more,"After watching this film I felt Avery was guilty as charged. This was before I did reading on all the damaging evidence mentioned in passing if at all by the filmmakers. It felt more like an extremely long episode of DatelineNBC instead of the first Paradise Lost film on the West Memphis Three. Unlike the Thin Blue Line, Making A Murderer doesn't show us there was very little evidence in Avery's case that would have exonerated him. DNA of his inside both her car and on the hood. The *69 calls to the victim to hide his number on the day of the murder. A key found several days after the initial searches of his residence. Evidence missed is not unusual, several key pieces that tied Manson's family to the Tate murders were found on subsequent searches. Lack of fingerprints? Profiler John Douglas wrote it's Mike rarer than one thinks to find identifying fingerprints at crime scenes; this while he was still with the FBI. After finishing this series I did some investigation and found even more evidence than covered in the film. On the other hand, I do believe there is a good chance his mentally slow cousin was fed his false confession.

If you like true crime I think you will really enjoy this for the entertainment value. It's not as depressing as My Brother's Keeper.

For entertainment value- 9 stars For being so biased on the ""railroading"" of Avery I give it 4 stars.

I rated my average down as by the eighth show I was beginning to lose interest."
Making a Murderer,Too much revealing history left out,"Steven Avery has a past history of severe domestic violence toward his first wife, Lori, and his former girlfriend, Jodi. Also, years ago, there were allegations of sexual abuse towards more than one minor relative of Steven. Unfortunately, I didn't research this until after I watched the series. The show's producer/writer couple are deluding themselves if they think he is simply a kind gentleman who was wrongly convicted. The show is compelling, but not real. Just do some homework if you watch this series so you're not in the dark. Of course, there are real problems with our judicial system, the producers were not honest about this case."
Making a Murderer,Kathleen Zellner brings hope...,"....don't mess with Avery's new lawyer. Her relentless and intelligent approach leaves no stone unturned and has brought much astounding new evidence to light.

I was impressed by the 2 original lawyers in Part 1, but they come across feeble and impenetrable compared to her.

Exploding to see the corruption finally get unfolded- this show has clearly taken the world by storm, and I pray justice and the truth will be brought to light."
Making a Murderer,Perfect portrait of the unreliability of the American Judicial System,"This was one of the most heartbreaking, inhumane and irrational criminal cases I came across in my entire life.

You will find two major types of reviews in here:

1. The skeptic type, based on rational and logical analysis of all the evidence and framings towards Steven Avery and Brenden Dassen making them not guilty (attributing around 10/10 rating).

2. The emotional type, based on irrational and illogical analysis of all the speeches and horror stories the prosecution, the police and the media told the public making them guilty (attributing around 01/10 rating).

This documentary series is constructed to favour the skeptic type (1). However, reality favoured the emotional type (2).

Living the American nightmare, shall them say.

Enjoy this highly unbiased masterpiece."
Making a Murderer,This is one important documentary,"This is one important documentary. This shows just how wrong the justice system is in America. Im from Sweden and did not know anything prior to this series. But If you have - like me, been reading and seeing other documentaries of this kind. You know this have happened several times. It makes me sick. When it comes to Brendan and his statement I immediately started to think about Jessie Misskelley. A boy with below average IQ and was one of three teenagers that got falsely accused of murdering three young boys in Memphis. He also made a ""confession"" after the cops had lured and guiding him towards what they wanted to hear. Anyway, I hope that one day, the truth will come out and the ones, that still walks free, get the judgement they deserve and that Brendan and Steven Avry will get their freedom back. This is something everyone should see. If I were a parent I would show it to my kids, if I was a teacher I would show it to my students. I will recommend it to everyone I know."
Making a Murderer,2+2=5. Orwell was right.,"This is an incredible documentary. There is no doubt that Steven Avery was framed by the police in order to prevent the $36M law suit. I wonder how long this will go on until the State of Wisconsin admits to the unbelievable injustice of Avery and the corruption of its officers. This also proves how much power lies in the State and how they really can do whatever they want, and how they control all authorities across it's jurisdiction."
Making a Murderer,i pray kathleen zellner will not give up,"This is a very disturbing case, i am a local in the area, and there was no insurance coverage for the county on steve's lawsuit, thus, pay it out of the general fund, or get him arrested and sent to prison....one of the biggest problems is how deputy colburn called in the rav4 plate 2 days before it was discovered, then when they played the recording of his call to dispatch, he said he did not recall doing that."

Making a Murderer,"If you were unconvinced after Part 1, Part 2 will leave you in no doubt.",Comentario no disponible
Making a Murderer,Did not enjoy it that much,The story is fascinating and my heart goes out to Steven Avery. But these shows cannot be fully trusted. They may be selling us a lie . He may have been not innocent. Cannot really say. I did not enjoy it as it only showed one side of the story
Making a Murderer,Sickening,"Planted evidence, multiple LE departments colluding to frame a target, coerced false confessions, unconscionable behaviors, ruined lives.

Justice is an illusion, held hostage by those with twisted motives and the means to subvert it. Shocking, infuriating. But then again, this is one case which has come to light. Very possible this is a systemic ill within the US justice system, something we subconsciously tend to overlook since the repercussions, were it true, could be so shattering."
Making a Murderer,"Part 1 is Great, Part 2 not so much","Firstly, whether you fall on the side of being for or against Steven Avery, I've put that aside for this review and am looking at it as a documentary and what it's trying to do.

Part One is a conspiracy documentary, and it's meant to invoke intrigue and doubt. You can't take everything in a series like this as truth only with a pinch of salt. It is for entertainment at the end of the day. I really enjoyed the direction and flow of the narrative in the first series solid 8 or 8.5 out of 10. I thought what we saw was well balanced and sparked interested. It's clear why it won awards.

Part Two was awful. Slow, dull, lack of narrative. I felt right from the start that this part was created due to the controversial reaction of audiences, not because they wanted to tell something compelling. In Part One the times spent with the family members were tasteful and worked with the tone. Here they were placed in as filler and served no purpose except to cheaply try and win your emotion. This part takes a complete 180 from part one and focuses on facts and fact finding. It's an interesting premise following the lawyers, but it's executed poorly and I found myself bored and wanted to turn it off. (Depaite usually enjoying legal dramas and documentaries.) Part Two I'm giving 4/10, so that's how I land on my 6/10."
Making a Murderer,Why did the producers lie to the world?,"So disappointed and frustrated and enraged at what these producers did. They left out so much of the truth from this series. Why?! So many people have been fooled and fed lies and for what? Fame? Money? Either way, God is just. I hope they come clean and finally tell the truth. Steven Avery is a murderer. One person made a comment that made the most sense to me. Instead of being mad, because we were made to believe that Steven Avery was innocent and framed because of this fictitious netflix series, he said, ""Well, the jury must have had information that the netflix documentary didn't show to the rest of the world."" So he researched, himself, and found the truth. While the rest of us, myself included, just believed what we were being fed... and it wasn't the complete truth, at all. Lesson learned!"

The Hook Up Plan,First series is a solid 7.5 Second is a 2.,"Don't watch the dubbed version, it's painful and unnecessary. Read the subtitles, it isn't that hard. First season is genuinely funny, endearing and surprising. I think the writers in second series gave up and forgot to actually care about the characters they had given such richness to. Pretend the second series doesn't exist. I made it to episode 2 and I was just angry and the ridiculously forced situations and hollow storylines. Do watch Call My Agent. That's good all the way through."

But they had to make another season.... had to make up forced storylines.... and spoil the fun.... i watched the second season out of respect for the first... but u don't need to..."
The Hook Up Plan,An invigorating series,"Elsa (Zita Hanrot) has just left her darling after discovering he has an affair. When she also uncovers that they will soon be married, it is then total depression. She completely loses her self-confidence and becomes a real wreck. Her two best friends are Émilie (Joséphine Draï) who is a stifling and irritating woman and Charlotte (Sabrina Ouazani) who is a hot and sexy woman despite her voice of Mike Tyson. These two friends will have the idea as wacky as ludicrous to hire Jules, a handsome man (Marc Ruchmann) who will play the role of a male prostitute (this is actually his everyday job) without Elsa being aware of the trickery, so that she may regain confidence in herself. And what was to happen ... will happen!

It's invigorating and well played, especially with Zita Hanrot who is excellent, as usual. If you liked her in this role as depressive as irresistible, I recommend you one of her first films and one of her last that I already saw early July, in preview. In addition, Paris is well highlighted, between the Hôtel de ville and the Île Saint-Louis.

As a synthesis, 6/7 of 10"
The Hook Up Plan,"Nice show, toxic clique","Jesus christ, those three women are toxic as hell, I didnt even feel sorry for them when bad things happened."
The Hook Up Plan,Fun to watch,"The first season is hilarious.

The second not so much.

And the third is a mixture between one and two.

There are characters that we love to hate, and simply love watching.

The group of friends sometimes are nuts and sometimes are loveable.

Who doesn't have a group of friends like that!?

I enjoyed it a lot!! Paris!! Didn't know there's street called ""Buenos Aires""!!!

Watch it. You won't regret it."
The Hook Up Plan,Do not watch it in English,"I watched it in original French, with English subtitles. It makes HUGE difference in perception. Generations B and X would hate it, Generation Y might like it. Generation Z would easily get hooked. The way it starts, Episode 1, is a put off. But if you stick, it gets better. Season 1 was much better than Season 2-lots of silliness that I didn't like. Season 1-7 stars, Season 2-5 stars. Acting was great, as expected from French Cinema. Sabrina Ouazani' voice is quite unique. Overall it is entertaining, humor is sharp and I don't agree with those who say it is full of cliches."
The Hook Up Plan,Fun and entertaining!,"This was a fun, heartfelt and cute story about friendship, trust and unconventional love. One thing I appreciated was that the side characters weren't just empty shells, whose only purpose is for the main characters to have someone to rant to. No, they had their own smaller plots, with their own problems and quirks. Honestly, my biggest problems with it were the tropes and the clichés, but hey it's a rom-com series so what else can you expect? Also, the main character Elsa is a little bit annoying but it doesn't matter really because the writing, acting and storyline is very good. It kept me hooked all the way through! I'm not a person who binge-watches shows (because I have a very short attention span) but I finished Plan Coeur in 1 day! I definitely recommend it, it's a very cute, entertaining and fun show."
The Hook Up Plan,"1st season was superb, 2nd not so much","I initially gave 9 stars as SEASON 1 of The Hook Up Plan was a pleasant surprise. Witty, intelligent, and enjoyable. Excellent acting and far more believable than your typical romantic-comedy type TV show. Characters were multidimensional, episodes were coherent, soundtrack was good, and the Parisian scenery is always a delight to look at. The fact that I laughed out loud several times while watching a French series with English subtitles means the humor translates very well. Also, this might be a bit vapid - but the actors were all quite attractive in somewhat unconventional ways which gives this show that extra boost in my opinion.

Fast forward to Season 2 and I was left rather disappointed, hence my new review and lower rating. Lots of irrational, borderline bizarre behavior among the characters made the show loose a lot of its realistic and relatable appeal. Everything felt rushed, incoherent, and definitely lacked the original humor and cinematic creativity from the first season. It was still alright to watch but unfortunately not as entertaining or memorable as the first season."
The Hook Up Plan,Delightful French Rom-Com,"Romantic comedies are not supposed to be ""realistic"". It's the genre. In Pretty Girl, Richard Gere, an uber-rich businessman, falls in love with a prostitute and they end up together. Realistic? Hardly. But everyone wants love to conquer all (and in the Rom Com genre, it does). One of the reviewers here lamented the depiction of Elsa, the female lead, as unlikable and awkward. In spite of her quirks, put-offs, and faux pas, we love her anyway and want her to succeed. That's the genre. Rom Coms are not meant to reinvent the wheel or cover new territory. If we're lucky, they are munchable mind-candy. If we're not, they are an annoying waste of time (we're talking about you, Jennifer Lopez). Most Rom Coms are terrible, sold by the weight of their leads. Throw Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks together (You Got Mail) and as terrible as the script may be, people will watch and extract what little blood can be squeezed from that anemic turnip.

Plan Coeur was delightful. It's nice to have something light and that doesn't require a huge commitment (there are eight (8) twenty-five minute episodes instead of 10-12 one-hour episodes) to invest for the ride. Yes, the story is implausible. Of course, it would never happen in real life, and if it did, everyone would be horrified and there would be no chance of redemption for any of the characters. Real life is not a genre. Romantic comedy is.

There is something honest about genre pieces in foreign languages and foreign settings. It isn't over the top. The characters are more subtle than they otherwise would be in their black-and-white counterparts in American cinema and television. Despite the exaggerated characters, the dialogue and the personalities ring more authentic than, say, 97% of the characters on Californication (or name your US-based Rom Com), even if the scenarios are not grounded in the same. I appreciate the stripped-down versions. Less is phoned-in, and more of the success of the show is based upon the story and the acting instead of the plot. In American Rom Coms, the scenarios often become so exaggerated to compensate for the sheer lack of thought, character development, or structure. This was a show that took its time to tell a simple story about a man and a woman meeting and falling in love under unlikely (improbable/ impossible) circumstances. But, for what it is, it works. I wish there would be more shows like Plan Coeur - fun, easy, endearing, mindless, but developed enough to be worth the while. While I would like to see more of this - in tone and levity - I would understand if there is not a second season. Within the Rom Com genre, there probably isn't anywhere for this story to evolve, unless subsequent seasons became more Sit Com instead of Rom Com.

Zita Hanrot, the actress who plays Elsa, is lovely for the part. Her naivete, honesty, and awkwardness translate without telegraphing. It's a fine line that she walks beautifully without overplaying. I hope to see more of her in the future.

The Hook Up Plan,First season good -- stop watching after the 1st episode of season 2.,"A fantastic first season, followed by a second season that seemed forced.

The wife and I immensely enjoyed watching the first season of this with subtitles (she speaks French, but I do not). We binged through the first season in one or two nights because we thought it was so great.

The second season was a different story.

Although we were glad we watched the first episode of Season 2, because that tied up some loose ends from season , we felt the show went downhill in the episodes that followed -- so much so, that after we got half-way through episode 4 of season 2 we decided that the show had lost its way, and we decided not to watch any more or the series."
The Hook Up Plan,The right kind of vibes,"Well thought out, feel good TV show! I binged the whole thing and I am completely shattered that I have to wait until the next season."
The Hook Up Plan,Entertaining/Annoying,"Minus one or two endearing characters (Antoine,Ronan...), most of the characters are unbelievably annoying. The main protagonist (Elsa) is annoying and naive in season 1 and unbearable and spineless in season 2. There are still quite a few comedic moments and overall it is an entertaining show. I watch it in french with English subtitles because I can't get myself to sit through a dubbed show."
The Hook Up Plan,Just started season 2. Disappointing,"Season 2 is starting out with a very unrealistic story and I'm sure it will only get worse from here, but I'm afraid they've lost me. I'll consider the season 1 finale as the end of the story. That works better I think."
The Hook Up Plan,Jules origin name,You put wrong actor as jules character. it would be marc ruhmann.
The Hook Up Plan,Amazing!!,"LOVED this serie so much!!! Season 2 was just as amazing as season 1! ((Watch it in french, so much better))"
The Hook Up Plan,Enjoyable Romantic Comedy,"The Hook Up Plan ( or Plan Coeur as it is in France) is a French romantic comedy series which has as its premise that the female lead character Elsa's friends employ a male escort to date her. The show then follows the lives of Elsa and her two best friends Milou and Charlotte and the men in their lives.

I really enjoyed this. I only discovered the series just before Christmas 2021 so I was able to binge watch all 3 series in one go.

It's lighthearted, it did make me laugh out loud at some points and was full of images of modern Paris, a nice antidote to 'Emily in Paris'.

The male escort device didn't last long at all really and then it just became about their lives. The lead characters were perhaps the least appealing to me, my favourites were Cha Cha, Antoine, Max and Milou.

Some people have said they have used this show to improve their French. I only have high school French but I watched this in French with English subtitles and it was easy to follow. Anyone who watches it with overdubbed American accents should be shot. I don't think it improves my French but i did quickly learn a word they didn't teach me at school - Putain!

I'm looking out for more French tv like this but it is hard to find."
The Hook Up Plan,Loved it,A 'not só common story'! It takes your breath away and makes you smile at every turn! Well done Netflix!
The Hook Up Plan,Get rid of Elsa!,"I like pretty much everything about it except Elsa. The actress and the character are so unlikable. She's so annoying, what is everyone supposed to love so much about her? I don't get it. That actor is too hot for her too. It's not realistic."
The Hook Up Plan,amazing,Comentario no disponible
The Hook Up Plan,Surprisingly good,"This show elevates a simple premise with strong writing and acting. The characters are relatable and three-dimensional, and it's genuinely funny. The Paris setting also adds to the charm. Looking forward to season 2."
The Hook Up Plan,Love this series,"I loved this series so much, I finished it one day. I couldn't stop watch. The characters are very good, my favorite character is clearly Julio! Just can't wait the 3rd season, I am so sooooo excited!"
The Hook Up Plan,Good vibes,"A nice Rom Com for chill evenings. Expect a group of friend with a lot of affairs, fun, easy and relaxing."
The Hook Up Plan,Really disappointing second series,"After watching season 1 and loving it, can't help but be majorly disappointed in season 2. The characters went into meltdown and I could barely follow the storyline. Instead of this being about an awkward girl looking for love, I felt like season 2 just through a load of ego's out in the hope it was funny and I'm not actually sure I laughed at all. Everything was so rushed. I think it may have been better if Elsa had stayed in Argentina. My advice, watch season 1 and leave it there."
The Hook Up Plan,Ok don't lose patience at beginning of season 2...,"Well, I changed my mind.

It's very easy to give up on this bande de dingues & I almost did, but kept halfway watching until it started to get real again about halfway through this season.

And from then on, there was some evolution in the lives of even Charlotte and Milou.

It would have been just too fairy tale if things had continued well after Elsa's séjour in « Buenos Aires » but of course the path of true love is never smooth and sometimes our best friends get in the way. And then, love also reveals our own doubts, fears, inadequacies as well as requiring we disclose our histories.

All this happens.

On to season 3..."
On My Block,Cute Show With Some Serious Topics,"After the first episode and getting use to the flow, loved it! I watched the entire season in less than 24 hours. The show beings up some serious and modern topics, but more lite. The show focuses more on friendships."
On My Block,Acting lesson,"This is a great show from a writing standpoint, but elevating it further is the talent of the cast. These kids give an acting lesson, with each totally committed to their respective characters, which results in perfect storytelling. The comedy is sensational, and a throwback to witty funny, long before the crude, slapstick comedy thrown at us these days took over. Recommend it to anyone. Brilliant."
On My Block,Its a decent show to pass the time.,"I don't love this show, but I don't hate it either. But Its easy to follow and overall decently enjoyable. The show is listed as a comedy and while there was quite few times I did cackle. A good percentage of time the show isn't funny or the jokes just fall extremely flat. It honestly plays more of as drama then anything. But one mainly aimed at teens to young adults. I can't see anyone older finding anything else redeeming here.

I did however feel that episodes not being long by any means was a positive. As well as some of the characters were enjoyable to watch. Would I recommend the show? Depends on kind of person you are.

If you're someone whos burned through everything else on netflix have go at it. But if you're looking for show to binge and haven't seen any really of what netflix has to offer, then avoid this at all costs."
On My Block,"Slow start, but a touchdown in the end","Over the pass two days between my classes, work, and meetings I have binge watched the first season of On My Block. I will admittedly say that I wasn't sure that I would fall in love with the show in the first couple of episodes-the acting and comedy seemed a little strained. However, I continued on and I am SO GLAD! This show is very entertaining involving both themes of comedy and drama. I think we can all relate to some of the awkward and enduring highschool/teenage scenes which is what brought me in. What kept me was the real ness and truth of the characters and their lives. Yes there are many light hearted scenes but there are many more that show the hard reality of many teenagers. It shows family drama, gang life, fitting in, and problems with friends and at home. I'm really excited about season 2 and would definitely recommend this show to everyone."
On My Block,Amazing,This show was seriously amazing. When I first saw the trailer I thought it looked interesting but wasn't going to watch it but then it kept popping up and I'm so happy that it did because I finally watched it and I loved it. I was interested in those kids lives and what was going to happen next. This show deserves all of the success and many seasons. It shows diversity and what many people go through daily.
On My Block,"Love the show, hated the ending of S3",Comentario no disponible
On My Block,Best show ever just not convenient when you're grown,I hate who ever made this show I was suppose to go to sleep 4 hours ago but I can't stop watching this show now imma be tired for work thanks.
On My Block,"The premise is interesting, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The vibe just feels off and forced. I wasn't really into it.","Season One: 5.5/10

Themes: Drama, Crime, Gangs, Friendship, High School, Treasure Hunt, Rough Neighborhood, Coming-of-Age, Latin Culture, Drugs, Violence, Guns, Humour & Relationships.

Top five characters: 1) Ruby Martinez, 2) Olivia, 3) Monse Finnie, 4) Jamal Turner and 5) Oscar 'Spooky' Diaz."
On My Block,A Great Netflix Original!,"On My Block is one of my favorite Netflix Originals. It is funny, clever, dramatic when it needs to be, and has a very good main cast. Also, something I love about this show is that it's characters all have purposes and most of them are very realistic. The characters are also very likeable, which couldn't hurt the show. Overall, this is a very good show and one of Netflix's better originals.

8.5/10."
On My Block,The going was good until they messed it up.,Comentario no disponible
On My Block,"It has its flaws, but I still enjoyed it","I watched On My Block in one go, which is always a good sign. Overall, I liked the story. Four teenagers have been friends for years and are now facing numerous challenges that come with first love and growing up which threaten their friendship. The main characters are all people of color who live in a poor neighborhood which is a nice change to your usually very white middle class coming of age setting. There have been quite a few more diverse TV shows lately which I think is really great.

However, there are some problems with this show (hence the seven star rating). The acting is mediocre at times. Especially the actor who plays Cesar (a teenage boy who follows in his brother's footsteps and joins the local gang) was not convincing to me. He didn't really portray much emotions which is a bad thing if you play a character who has such a serious storyline. Some scenes, especially in the first few episodes, felt awkward. I can't exactly point out why that was. I blame it on the acting and maybe also the camera work. I also haven't made up my mind about wether or not I like the characters. Sometimes they are real assholes and/or don't feel like realistic, complex human beings. Other times I really liked them. I'd say that the girl,Monse, is my favourite and gives the most consistent (good) performance. There were some sexist tropes that bothered me but I won't go into it here. It would have been cool if the creators had realized this and deconstrucetd it in the same way the deconstructed other elements / tropes but you can't have everything and it's probably only a minor detail for most viewers.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the show and might even watch it a second time. It made me laugh out loud on several occasions even if the humour wasn't always my taste. It's not a master piece, it doesn't stand out but it's also better (I feel) than your average TV show and offers an original take on an old concept."
On My Block,hot damn,"I love this show so much! The characters, the plot, the acting, the humour and the whole journey which this show took us around, the roller world subplots and the perfect couples getting together, to the plot twist at the very end, this show deserves all the perfect ratings and praise, as well as a second season."
On My Block,Season 4 bombed,Comentario no disponible
On My Block,Not realistic,"It is obvious that no one involved with this show, writers or actors, has ever really lived in the hood... The attempts at portraying gang life, or life in the hood in general are laughable."
On My Block,perefect,"This show has everything, good characters and development, comedy, adventure, feels... I gave it 9/10 cuz i will never forget the granny toe scene T-T"
On My Block,True to life!!,"Just finished watching the entire season and I'm shook!!! Go into it I had my doubts, but a couple of minutes into it I fell head over heels for each main character! These young men & women portray these characters with such truthfulness. The viewer is left with a sense of realness and authenticity to what life is for them in this part of Los Angeles or their block. The storyline realistically portrays the hardships the residents on the block experience. But is the comical and satyric approach that captures the viewer. Give it a try you might like!"
On My Block,Watch Before you read the bad reviews!!,"I've come to realise we all don't have the same tastes, hence the bad reviews here. This is a great show, and I watched it in one go. I watch alot of shows so its always had to pick a new show to watch, but when I started this one, I watched it in one go from start to finish, that's how one can tell its a good show. I got surprised when i read some of the bad reviews here, I imagined we must be watching very different shows. It just goes to show we can't all like the same thing, people are different. So before you judge the show from a few bad reviews, trying watching it for yourself and see if its for you. My favorite character/crush is Monse, I just love her energy, and I liked her even more when I learnt she doesn't have any acting experience. I would recommend this to anyone."
On My Block,Amazing tv show!!!,"If you're thinking about watching this show you should watch it now!! It's an emotional tv show and sometimes quite funny. Everytime you finish an episode it will leave you wanting more. It's a tv show about teenagers beginning their first year of high school in South Central Los Angeles, a neighborhood where hearing gunshots is an everyday part of life.I really recommend it."
On My Block,i mean not bad,First season was crazy good but the second season wasn't the best but overall plot 10/10 but the acting 4/10 and that's me being being nice. like i love the idea and how the show flows and the soundtrack but wow no one in this show can act without it being cringy
On My Block,On My Block,"On My Block is a tv series filled with stereotypical representations, accents and ways of being. The plot is bad and poorly written. It is far from perfect. It is not even a good tv show technically and the acting isn't all that great either. Having said that, I like it. I like all the characters and the way they assemble and got each other's back, the adventures are entertaining and it makes me laugh a couple of times. My favorite is Jamal, so much energy and the funnier to me. This 3 season was good, probably the best one and god damn why does it have such an emotional ending... It broke my heart. Hope it continues!"
On My Block,Finally a show acuratley representing youth culture in 2018,"From the way the kids speak to the background music, its all great. Im tired of watching shows that take place in the past or do not accurately represent todays youth. Next season I want to see more trap music including latino trap, I want to see how the kids react to marijuana, I want to see more social media and meme references. Keep it up please. Cant wait to see these young actors grow and improve."
On My Block,Great show,The dialogue is natural and full of quick witted humor. It's a good refreshing show about teens for teens (and adults)!
On My Block,"Good TV Show with talented, young actors","This show has great potential! The scoring is compelling and the acting is good. The right mix of humour to drama, it's like Atlanta with teenagers, which isn't a bad thing. Jason Genao, the actor that plays Ruby was brilliant in this season, the whole cast did very well. And wow! That cliffhanger at the end!"
On My Block,Total disappointment,The show started out great living on planet earth. For some reason the writers felt like they had to go off the wall towards the end of season one and absolutely lost me. Most of the stupidity revolves around Jamal. I think they're mostly all fine young actors but the writing does not do them justice. There's only so far my brain can stretch. I'm happy for the people who love it. I watched the whole season so I'm not giving in ignorant opinion. Watcher beware. There are much better shows out there.
On My Block,Frustrating watch,"It's so frustrating to watch the characters act stupidly for the sake of moving the plot along. Ugh. Not to mention, the whole Monse and Cesar relationship got me so mad I threw my remote at the TV and cracked it. I hate this show."
