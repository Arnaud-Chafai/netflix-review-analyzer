Derry Girls,You Don't. Have To Be Irish To Love This Show,One of the top 10 funniest shows I have ever seen and I am a 65 yr. old American. I just binged Season 2 and happy to report Season 3 has been confirmed. I don't often laugh out loud in my home when viewing comedy yet every episode has made me do so. Every cast member is brilliant and so is the writing. I was utteriy amazed that Clare and Michelle are in their 30's. The other 2 girls are 25. It is a testament to their acting ability that they portray teenagers so convincingly. I hope Season 3 has about 10 episodes instead of 6.
Derry Girls,Brilliantly Conceived and Written,"Hilarious, quick, quirky and brilliantly written. Funniest thing on Netflix. Set in Northern Ireland during the troubles, the jokes come from all directions-family, growing up, fitting in, Catholic schools, the folly of religious conflicts, and on and on. Lisa McGee has created a phenomenal show populated with engagingly funny characters everywhere you turn."
Derry Girls,Best comedy show I've seen in a long time,This show is a heartwarming and hilarious Brilliant writing and how it's set in Ireland during the troubles in the 90s is just very clever and brilliant
Derry Girls,Derry Girls,"Derry Girls is one of the best new comedies I have seen on TV in recent times. There's great chemistry between the lead characters who are all likable and have their own hilarious personal traits. The supporting cast are also excellent, Grandad Joe in particular I thought was very funny. I laughed a lot throughout the series and it also handled some sensitive subjects very well. I am glad that it's already been confirmed we will have a series 2!"
Derry Girls,Class.,"A thoroughly enjoyable and hilarious addition to channel 4's comedic offerings. The extreme success of 'Derry Girls' lies deeply rooted in the effective well-rounded development of the main and recurring characters. With all four of the Derry Girls being totally antithetical to each other, the show seemingly appeals to a wide and diverse audience without losing sight of its purpose as a comedy. Set in 1990s Derry, McGee intricately intertwines the treacherous and realistic political undertones as an effective backdrop to successfully juxtapose the comedic on-goings in the lives of the core characters. It should win lots of awards."
Derry Girls,Very funny,"I do not normally watch shows like this, but I found it to be laugh-out-loud funny."
Derry Girls,Derry funny indeed,"I'd almost given up on TV sit-coms, in fact the last one I really enjoyed was ""The I.T. Guys"" and how many years ago was that? Anyway, it was my wife who alerted me to this series and a quick look at the first two episodes of the second series found me looking up series one which she'd already watched and I have to say she wasn't wrong, as I found it absolutely hilarious.

It reminded me of so many of my favourite sit-coms, like ""Father Ted"", naturally, ""Press Gang"" and yes, ""The I.T. Guys"", but it still has its own identity. Set in early 1990's Derry in Northern Ireland before the Good Friday Agreement came into place, it concerns the misadventures of a group of five young friends, four female and Irish, one male and English and by extension their eccentric families.

It makes clever use of the political and religious backdrop for the comedy, the families in question being Roman Catholics living in the predominantly Protestant town of Derry, so that one episode has the hapless family attempting to head for a weekend in the country while an Orange Walk is in full swing, while another sees the young gang claim to have had holy visions in a chapel, with a statue of the Virgin Mary apparently ""smirking"" at them.

The situations are amusingly set up, but it's the rapid-fire gags, often near-the-knuckle, which had me creasing myself as well as the individual characterisations themselves. I don't know who my favourite is amongst them but the central character of Erin, with her teenage crushes, literary pretensions and down-to-earth sensibilities probably shades it, although the hormonally imbalanced Michelle, uber-enthusiastic Clare and ditzy Orla and doormat James run her close and all get their share of the good lines on offer, not to mention their dysfunctional parents and grandparents too.

All the episodes I've watched were of the same high standard with the only difficulty sometimes being the machine-gun-like Northern Irish delivery which can be a bit hard to pick up sometimes. That said I'm getting more than enough laughs from what I can see and hear so I'm not complaining too much.

To all those many millions more people currently watching the appallingly bad ""Mrs Brown's Boys"" do yourself a favour and switch to this immediately."
Derry Girls,Excellent show,"Have now watched all three episodes and simply think its wonderful writing and acting . I served in Derry 83-84 and can assure all , the humour of this show is spot on as with the acting , trust me , iv P checked more people in Derry than I care to recall however there humour never ceased to amaze me , specially the young ladies . Great show and wonderful people portrayed in difficult times ."
Derry Girls,One of the best comedies I have watched in a long time,Comentario no disponible
Derry Girls,All that and 7 bags of chips....,"I have this on a constant loop, can't wait for the next season. Ignore the Erin bashers, she is brilliant and so is the writing and the rest of the cast. I've turned off the nightly news in place of Derry Girls and my outlook has actually gotten brighter, thanks girls (and the wee English fella.)"
Derry Girls,An easy to binge series,"Sitcoms are about set up and execution. The derry girls have enough characters to have an endless amount of series. There isn't a real plot, or developmental story arc, there isn't a single lesson to learn or for the characters to learn, but watching these bold girls navigate teenage responsibilities is fun to watch. The adults are just as fun and interesting as their children. Most situations are based in reality, which makes this show even funnier. Everyone has met the derry girls in their own lives, or knows someone like them. I wish the episodes had more continuity, but the cause and effect set up doesn't disappoint."
Derry Girls,I love seeing the girls....and James.,Comentario no disponible
Derry Girls,A slightly crude and over the top comedy with a realistic and melancholy feel to it.,"Season One: 6.5/10

Season Two: 6.5/10

Season Three: 7/10

Themes: Comedy, Friendship, Northern Ireland, Religious Conflict, High School, Adults & Family.

Top three characters: 1) Sister Michael, 2) Michelle Mallon and 3) Gerry Quinn."
Derry Girls,Too Old,I couldn't get past the fact that the teens look closer to 30 than 16. Erin and her cousin look to be the same age as Erin's mother. Michelle is a very entertaining character but she too looks older than many of the moms and teachers. Then there's the exaggerated facial expressions and painfully obvious sitcom plots. I really wanted to like this but gave up after the first season.
Derry Girls,Hilarious!,"I haven't laughed so much for any how of late as I have for this one. Saw this on Netflix and can't recommend it highly enough. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job. I especially liked Siobhan McSweeney who plays Sister Micheal. She's an absolute hoot and a real scene-stealer. Her deadpan dialogue delivery left me in splits. The script of this show is extremely witty. It really captures the angst and the indignation that the characters feel in the funniest way possible. I found myself remembering my ""rebel without a cause"" teenage days while watching this show. The principal cast - the four girls and James - share great chemistry and have done a fantastic job making sure the funny lines from the script really land. It's a pity this show only has 6 episodes. I liked it so much, I've seen it twice and really want more!"
Derry Girls,Pleasantly surprised,"Being a non-Irish man in my 40s I'm clearly not in the key demographic, but I really enjoyed this show. It felt a bit too broad and farcical for my tastes in the beginning, but it got better. The acting is solid throughout. I watched the whole thing in two days and am looking forward to season 3."
Derry Girls,Brilliant,"I'm a 52 yo Australian bloke and this is only the third review I've ever written. Initially I was scepticalabout a show about teenage girls from Derry, but a mate highly recommended it. To put it simply, this is one of the best series I've seen. The comedy is interlaced with some truly poignant observations and social commentary. Brilliant. Kudos to the Lady who wrote and created this masterpiece.

Did I mention Brilliant?!"
Derry Girls,Very funny but not for the easily offended,Comentario no disponible
Derry Girls,Plankies and other blasted colonials need not apply...,"But this is #@%&* hilarious! It's rare for any TV writing to surprise me with originality, and far rarer still for a ""comedy"" show to exhibit enough originality to catch me off guard, but this is a piece of abso-frecking-lute genius! If you're from the UK of GB & NI, watch it; you'll laugh your @rse off. If not, give it a try, and google lots. to try to get where these absolutely brilliant characterisations come from. I'm actually jealous that someone else wrote this brilliant work!"
Derry Girls,Auch! It's grand! so it is.,"My family moved to Northern Ireland, in 1968, while my Father, who was in the US Air Force, was in Vietnam. This program revives much of the experience my sisters and I had in grammar school, there (albeit we were Protestants in County Down and a generation before)."
Derry Girls,It's right up there with the UK's best,"I'm a Sri Lankan 27-year old man, and after finding about Shaun of the dead and watching it, I became an UK comedy fan. The dark, sarcastic comedy style was right up my alley. US comedy can be too over-the-top, silly and too corny sometimes, in my opinion (As a man from a country with 0 movies in any recognized comedy list). I completed the trilogy then, and bunch of other UK movie classics after and then got into TV shows. Inbetweeners, IT crowd, Peep show are some of my favorites. And after searching for a show in the style of Inbetweeners, I found about this show - Derry Girls. And as a lover of the classic UK sitcoms, and as a avid comedy fan, I can genuinely say this is right up there with the classics, and as much hilarious as one of the best in the genre. Can't really relate to the culture or the style of behavior of the characters, but the comedy gold was not lost on an average south asian. We watch a lot of US shows & UK shows in Sri Lanka, but the accent was sometimes too hard to follow but the subtitles definitely helped. Inbetweeners is still my favorite of the two, maybe because it was somewhat relatable when it came to guys stuff. Still easily one of the best sitcom shows I have seen period, NOT ONLY from UK. If you are not from the UK, please keep the subtitles on, because some of the jokes can get missed due to how fast and nonchalant they deliver the lines (part of the UK style, I think). 10/10 Show, 10/10 comedy, 10/10 acting, 8/10 story, and 9/10 teenage drama. Sorry if my English was bad, this isn't my native language."
Derry Girls,Erin is so annoying but...,I've enjoyed it and would have enjoyed it more if Erin wasn't so annoying her facial expressions and the over the top acting is off putting.
Derry Girls,A little nutty but still brilliant,"This was an absolute TREAT. I did not know what to expect when I started watching this but after 2 or 3 scenes, I knew I was gonna binge watch this. I dont feel like The Troubles is a historical event that has been touched on very often in popular culture. That´s why I found it so refreshing to see it in a comedic way through the eyes of Derry teenagers.

The writing was spot on, you could never tell what was going to happen or what someone was going to say. Everything was just surprisingly hilarious all the time. If you can overlook the fact that the actors who are playing the teenagers are around ten years older than they should be, then you´ll find their performances convincing. Some of them overacted sometimes (Erin´s character is a little unnatural) but since the whole show is a bit nutty it kind of works."
Derry Girls,Charming show,"I enjoyed watching this show and was sad when I finished season 2. The misadventures the main characters go through are hilarious to watch, the main character's family is fun to watch and relatable as well - I'm not even Irish ! While it's true that it can be over the top in some ways, like Erin's (the main character) constant face squirm and Claire's over the top breakdown in every episode. Little things like that become unfunny and old. Still, I can overlook that and honestly say that I love this show. I like the idea of setting it in a really turbulent time in the country's history and showing how even with the violence going on, these girls are still living out their teenage years as best as they can. I see other reviews bashing the show for following sitcom conventions and honestly, that says more about those user's over esteemed egos than the show. God forbid different genres follow similar conventions, could you imagine ? It's a great show and I highly recommend it."
Derry Girls,I don't understand the rave reviews,What am I missing? I forced myself to get through the first episode and it was painful. I didn't laugh once. I don't understand why people are giving it such great reviews.

Naruto,Naruto made me fat,"Everyday after school I went to the store and bought a bottle of soda and some snacks, and watched Naruto when i came home. Some months later I was borderline obese. 10/10 would recommend."
Naruto,It can grow on you...,"I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.

Cut about ten episodes later, the plot arc currently being followed felt to me like it was not going to matter much to the main story. Some episodes had drawn out battles, and I got that feeling that the anime would be the type where they would go from different area to different area, developing their skills and learning moral lessons and such, but there would be no grand plot, no B story, that tied the series together. I also worried it would fall into mediocrity. Without giving anything away, by the end of that arc (about 19 episodes in), my mind was changed.

Having seen all of the series up to the current episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect, as there are slow times in the series (and the cartoon suffers from tricks to get as many episodes out of the original story as they can), and I won't say everyone will end up liking it but I can say it had unexpectedly become one of my favorite anime."
Naruto,"Great moments, but lots of filler scattered throughout","You're probably thinking: ""well I could just skip the fillers by searching filler episode up."" That's fine but that's not the only issue with the show. It's that even in nonfiller episodes it feels like they are buying a lot of time. If the show was compressed to maybe 90/100 episodes then it would be amazing. The hype moments really are hype and the ninja stuff is cool."
Naruto,First Anime I've watched and it got me hooked,"Last year my roommate got me hooked on watching Naruto. I had never really been a big Anime fan. Shows like DBZ and Inuyasha never really appealed to me. I had seen a few episodes of Tri-Gun and found it rather interesting but the story of Naruto is what really drew me in. The quality with which it is written is very well done. And is not centered entirely around fighting, there actually is a plot here. The story is about 3 ninjas as they progress from genin level (beginning ninjas) onward to some rather high lvl battles and their hardships along the way. Each of these characters is well described with a rich background. And each character possesses unique abilities, none of which I have found boring or pointless so far. Currently I have read all the manga and have all the Anime downloaded. It is a truly excellent series. I fear that if they do bring it to the US. that sites that provide us with the anime may not be allowed to continue providing us with the show and if it comes to US television it will be edited because they will probably intend for kids to watch it and in it's original state it is entirely inappropriate and in no way should be compared to a Saturday morning cartoon show. The different jutsus are exciting to watch and well thought out. Battles can tend to last multiple episodes but to me that does not matter, the flashbacks just add to the storyline. The quality of the actual animation which can really be seen during the fight scenes is unbelievable. They truly have some very talented artists working for them. Lastly, the music is top notch. The intro's are extremely cool and the music in the actual show is also very well done."
Naruto,God of anime,"For me there is nothing above naruto. I just can't get my mind out of this anime. Once you entre the naruto world, there's no coming back❤❤❤ I love every bit of the show (leaving some fillers). If you didn't watched naruto you're missing paradise of earth💕💕 10 rating is too less for naruto."
Naruto,It's an amazing anime.,If u r looking for a good anime to watch then watch naruto. I have watched 7 anime in my life and Naruto is still my favorite. It's an amazing story with the best character development I have ever seen. If u haven't already watched it then watch fast!
Naruto,One Of The Best... This Anime Is Perfect Even For Grown-ups..,Comentario no disponible
Naruto,Never will there be an anime as great as this,"Naruto is...how to say? Magnificent, glorious and entertaining. Its almost flawless in the way it presents itself. The overall story is new and refreshing. The characters are inspirational and beautifully portrayed. The fight scenes ae overall breathtaking and neat. The drama in here is very emotional and moving. The jokes are well executed but sometimes overdone. Most people complain how most of the characters are unreal. But who cares. Their fun and feel real once you give the show a chance. If you ain't an anime fan then give this show a chance. Those who are anime fans will simply love it. There is nothing really to hate about it. Pure perfection. 10/10"
Naruto,This Show is awesome in many aspects,"Okay, let me start out by saying this show should be Rated TV-MA for the following Reasons: 1. Disturbing Violent Content, Harsh Language, Horror Effects, Gore, sexual content, Sexual Inuendo, Brief Nudity, Demonic Themes, Unsettling Images, Grossout Violent content and Torture Now don't get me wrong, when i first started watching this show, i was pretty damn sure it was gonna be another one piece or dragon ball Z knockoff but to my surprise this show has depth, drama, comedy, Horror and Suspense all rolled into one...granted some of the episodes are like your worst nightmare, however this isn't like dragon ball Z where most of the villains talk so much crap that it ticks you off, no its quite the opposite, save 1 and thats The lead Villain which they wont let me say who really makes me mad, he's such a sick freak that it makes the Squad 12 captain from Bleach look tame, yeah he's that bad and Kabuto, god that kid really made me mad, it makes me wish they killed both of them off in the 4th season and did away with it but, they had to drag it over too Naruto Shippuden....which is by far more graphic than this one....

Naruto is my number 2 favorite anime, with One Piece being my number 1 and Dragon ball Z being my 9th favorite...anyways, thats all for now"
Naruto,"Very good anime with action and humor, but really what sets it apart are the characters.","This show first grabbed my attention when I saw clips of it in the game for the Xbox 360 called ""Naruto: Rise of a Ninja"". After I played that game I just had to watch the show and I am glad I did as it turned out to be a very fun and complete show. The characters are what I love most about it as we follow Naruto on his quest from being a goofball with seemingly little talent to someone who could defend his village if need be. You get to see him join a team with two other rookie ninja Sauske and Sakura and there teacher Kakashi as they head for a town in trouble from the local mob boss. You then go on a journey with them as they must take a test to see if they are ready to take the next step up in class of ninja. There are other characters here to meet and the show just gets more interesting as they must survive an assault by the sand village and try and find a new leader for the village. A friend departs to seemingly join the villain and then you have a few stories not from the manga and it wraps up in a nice story about a group going after Garaa, also not in the manga, but still good. The show has a few minor gripes from me, the first few shows in the series seemed to go over a lot of the same things at the beginning of the show chronicling what happened at the end of the previous show, also there are a lot of flashbacks especially in earlier episodes as well. The final few shows after the battle between Naruto and Sauske at times are a bit weak too, as they never had these stories in the manga therefore they sometimes do not really fit in the main flow of the show. One case had Naruto who is all about training and getting better is seemingly afraid to fight another young ninja Rock Lee. All in all though the show is very entertaining. The humor works and the action is great. The show also has very good music as well. The characters that are in this show that are great are to many to list though my favorite has to be the pervy sage Jirya. That is aside from Naruto. I like Garaa a lot as well, it is very hard to have a favorite when there are so many to choose from. I look forward to the next series in this saga."
Naruto,"Excellent ideas, good execution but the damn fillers....","Naruto seems to be one of the more popular anime nowadays. And why shouldn't it be? It has an interesting story and a good plot line. The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps), the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed.

But then again, there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers. Hell, it wouldn't be a big problem either if the fillers weren't the same damn story repeated over and over and over again. It's basically something like this: Naruto and company meet some guy/girl/creature who's different from the others and rejected by the society and Naruto goes 'You're like me'. Beat bad guys up, earn the new guy's trust, become friends, go home and never talk of the incident ever again. From about the 120th episodes to the end of the series there's nothing but this aforementioned nonsense. None of these episodes are nearly as memorable as the one actually related to the plot. Even other anime which are infested with fillers have them 1-2 episode long and they come in between the actual plot related episodes and they do NOT dominate the whole series, unlike Naruto.

If they had just made the series about 100 episodes with less(or none at all) fillers, this would've been much better. Lots of potential for a great anime down the drain. If you're looking for an anime with little to no fillers, I highly suggest One Piece.

Again, this is an above average anime which had the potential to be amazing but was ruined by the overuse of bland fillers."
Naruto,NOT A DBZ RIPOFF,"OK, so I've watched 103 episodes so far of this series, and I have to say it, Naruto is original. Yes Mishimoto was a big follower of Toriyama, and in many ways Naruto is a sort of homage to him. But Naruto has a lot of things that DBZ was missing. First off, when characters die, THEY STAY DEAD!!!!! There is no special way to wish them back. Once they're gone they're gone. Second, music: the music in Naruto is 100X better then anything heard in DBZ. Dbz did have some cool themes, but Naruto is the only series where I have actually imported the soundtrack. There's almost nothing wrong with the soundtrack other then the usual soft theme. Granted it isn't a Yoko Kanno piece, but in essence not everything should be compared to the work she does because it invariably falls short. Thirdly, character development:

The characters develop feelings for each other, and you will find yourself developing feelings for the characters. There are animes that do that, but not to the extent Naruto does. I have cried multiple times while watching Naruto because of the pain that Naruto and Company have to go through. Mostly Naruto in his quest to become Hokage. In DBZ, I couldn't care less about what happened. Fourth, fights: There is nothing wrong with the length of the fights in Naruto. They're not too fast and they're not too unbearably long. The average fight lasts about 4 episodes. There is an exception to this in the 70s, but only because there are two fights going on at the exact same time. In short, download the first 20 episodes, which takes you through the first saga. Yes, 103 episodes is a lot of time, but the story will keep you engrossed. Also of note, Happy Birthday to the anime which turns 2 years old on Sunday Oct. 3rd. I give this a 9/10"
Naruto,how many flashbacks can this anime get?,I would rate this anime a solid 8 if not for the tons of flashbacks I mean enough already we remember no need to repeat the same flash back over its really frustrating
Naruto,Overrated anime,This anime is boring and very long. 93 episodes are filler WTF

Naruto,"The best, most detailed anime I have ever watched!","When I first started watching this I had no idea what it was. At first it seemed a little silly and childish but I soon realized the detail that went into the stories, backstories, the world, the ninja way, chakra, their abilities is all fantasically explained in great detail.

Once you get past the silly moments (which actually grow on you) the show has some of the best writing I have ever seen. Despite being a cartoon, this show has an excellent storyline and I am currently on Shippuden ep 135 and Shippuden gets even better.

The people who do the artwork, the animation have incredible imaginations and bring to life so many things you will never see in any other show.

From gengitsu's and all sort of cool jitsu's they bring this show to life in a way that just blows my mind.

The way they do the animations is incredible.

A top notch show. Top notch writers. I did find that Naruto does have quite a few filler episodes compared to Shippuden. But, it's still quite an enjoyable series.

I finally purchased Naruto on DVD many years ago. I would purchase Shippuden but there are so many seasons it's a little too expensive for me at this stage of my life.

I highly recommend Naruto and Shippuden. It's one of the best stories I have watched in an anime.

I have cheered for him, actually had tears coming down when a certain character passed away in later seasons.

The main story in Naruto is top notch. Shippuden has way less fillers - I would say around episode 135 almost no fillers that I can remember. Every episode had something to contribute to character development.

I haven't finished watching Shippuden... I really hope the writing stays top notch. I have a feeling it will.

I can't wait to go back and watch Naruto once I am done Shippuden. It's been many years since I watched Naruto and now that I have the DVD's from Amazon I am eager to re-watch this wonderful show once I get it into my Plex."
Naruto,Great series with great characters.,"I am not a die hard anime fan and i found this series most enjoyable.

The characters are well developed and ALL have a reason for doing what they do. After you watch, say, 10 episodes you will start to like them and fell bad when they get hurt, or die(unlike dbz when in a year you can come back to life...).

The storyline progresses not too fast, and not too slow providing you with just enough time to swallow what you just heard.

As the story progresses the characters all faced with difficult challenges and difficult decisions they have to make. You will not want to wait for the next one. The only bad things are that the English voice acting plainly sucks and there are too many flashbacks."

Naruto,naruto,"Naruto has to be the greatest anime series on the whole world, it has it all comedy, drama and jaw dropping good action fight scenes. the best fight has to be the fight between naruto and sasuke in the valley of the end, the detail put into making that fight alone must have taken weeks. Overall the best anime ever, its worth watching. i used to watch dragon ball z but compared to naruto, its nothing. its slightly disappointing how its has a lot of filler episodes staring from about episode 145 and how much of the story line is flash backs from the characters past. Also the legendary 3 have a fight and thats nothing much compared to most other fights scenes on the series, its supposed to be the ultimate battle against all of the 3 legends of the nartuo world, but the other fights and the main story line makes up for that. the characters are all SO original the most original has to be gaara of the desert, his ninjutsu is the power to use sand, to defened and offend the target, hes got to be my favourite. Orochimaru is a VERY original character alswell, when he first shows up in the story, your not sure if thats really a bad or good guy which makes it even better to watch. After watching an episode you just have to go onto the next one. I got through the whole zabuza saga in one day, I just couldn't stop watching it. you should really consider buying the Japanese version as the American version is not nearly as good."
Naruto,Naruto is the best anime that every human being should watch.,This anime taught me many lessons rather than my life did.
Naruto,"Simply said, epic !","This is the first show that put me in the anime world. I first started watching it on jetix, the first 20 episodes of it, which i found to be really interesting. But then it kept repeating them over and over, so i wanted to know what happens next. I went on youtube, and there i started watching the continued episodes (before that copyright policy rule was implemented), on crappy quality, but it was so damned good. I was once home alone, i ordered a pizza, and i watched 31 hours of naruto, with no break, i barely could go to the toilet (who says WoW is the most addictive thing on the internet?). I then discovered better quality episodes on veoh, and later on some different fansub groups like dattebayo which were subbing the show on great quality. Anyway, the point is that the show is very, very, very addictive, no wonder tho, when it has such an epic and genius script. You simply can't predict anything here, you will never be guessing what's coming next, the result will be completely unpredictable, and genius. You will die waiting for the next episode (the 1 minute break between switching the episodes). The soundtracks are, incredible, no matter how tough you think you are, you will have no chance to resist crying. Some of the scenes are so deep, they impress you so much, that you can't help but start crying (i.e. search on youtube for ""sadness and sorrow"" soundtrack, or ""Man of the world"", no matter if you like the anime or not, just search for these 2 soundtracks).

So i completed watching all the episodes from Naruto, and went to Naruto shippuuden, where the characters grow up and continue the story. Imo, the shippuuden series are the ones that gave me the impression of this show being epic.

The basic story is so long, that i cannot describe it here, way too long. Basiclly, there are 2 friends, the main character naruto, and sasuke. They choose to go on different paths, while naruto keeps thinking of his friend, but sasuke chooses a path of vengeance, to avenge his family who got killed by his older brother, itachi. He seeks power and finally obtains it, and in the end he finds up that his brother actually loved him very much and protected him all his life, that after they have a fight and sasuke wins (wich again, the way the director writes the plot, is so genius, always keeps you shocked).

In the end, make sure you watch this show, you will not be disappointed. The first episodes are a bit childish - but this anime is certainly not for kids, later you will see why - but the plot is so incredibly good that it will keep you watching and watching it, i guarantee that !

10/10 from me, i would rate more if possible."
Naruto,Stop and think before you start watching,"If you, like me, are going to start watching this anime for the first time and you are also in your 20s, I definitely do not recommend it. Both the first season and the hurricane chronicles are designed for a children's audience. The high score is solely on the nostalgic feelings of former children. The slow speed of storytelling and the incredible amount of fillers made watching 720 episodes a torture. Think twice."

Naruto,"Started great, but slowly loses it's charm...","I won't spoil much, just some general stuff.

Naruto, popular anime series, started of with a blast (at least in my eyes) with variety of well characterized characters and intriguing story in ninja world and on top of all it is very addicting. If I had to compare this anime series to another one I would pick Dragonball. Although all of this positive stuff, Naruto began to to lose it's charm as more and more episodes flew by. The most disappointing part of Naruto are the fillers that are pretty bad, unnecessary and just ruining the show. Don't get me wrong, they are emotional and all, but they are just slowing and stalling the show. I only hope that this will change in future and that things will start to look up, cause this could end up like another Dragonball, which started great but later became awful.

Objectively, from this point, I would give it a 5-6 stars, but I can't do that due to the emotional attachment to it's characters and world. So this grade is some mix of subjective and objective experience.

I'll cross my fingers for this show and you should go watch and see it for yourself."
Naruto,Overrated,"To see people say this is the ''Best anime ever'' is BEYOND laughable. I must admit at first I was intrigued. I as SO HOOKED. I couldn't stop watching, it was amazing. But then it got old, boring, and PREDICTABLE. I mean Naruto always wins. If you see a villain fight him or a main character you KNOW and I mean KNOW that character is going to be defeated or killed off. It was frustrating. I stopped watching around episode 110 or so? I mean I think the show still goes on or something shippuden which is ridiculous. They are going to keep destroying this show. Honestly it's an alright show with an amazing start but dragged out."

Tobot Galaxy Detectives,Feeble,"It's not a worthy sequel to the OG. I enjoyed Tobot, Tobot: Attack of the tobot force and Tobot Athlon. However, this completely ruins the values and is weak. Terrible show."
Tobot Galaxy Detectives,Bring back the original Tobots.,"Everything about Tobots went downhill after Athlon. To make this show better, just bring back the original tobots. I'm talking original original like, Tobot X, Y, Z, W, C, D, R, 0, Terracle, and Cargo."
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,A hit and a miss,"I really like Chelsea Handler - usually. But this special a hit and a miss.

Except when it comes to her dogs - and then she's always a hit!!

And then a miss on cats!! HA!

She is NOT at all PC and that's great too. She's a comedian. So I suppose a hit and a miss is a good thing."
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,"Worst stand-up performance I have ever seen... If you can even call this ""stand-up""","First off, this isn't a stand-up performance. Chelsea Handler uses this ""special"" to promote her book by telling egotistical, conceited stories about her daily life. These stories will only be funny if you enjoy these three recurring punchlines:

1. Going out of your way to be rude to other people.

2. Spending obnoxious sums of money to demonstrate how rich you are.

3. Poo-poo and pee-pee.

I have seen and rated more than 100 stand-up specials. This is by far the worst special that I have ever seen. It was not funny, and I could not relate to a single thing she said throughout the entire show.

I'll simply use the title of this special to demonstrate Chelsea Handler's style of humor. The title of the show is ""Uganda Be Kidding Me."" As mentioned before, flaunting large sums of money is a recurring theme throughout the show. Uganda is one of the poorest countries in the world in which the average work day is 12 to 18 hours/day, and 38% of these workers live on less than $1.25/day... Not something I think is particularly funny."

Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,She is hilarious,I love Chelsea Handler and I find her absolutely hilarious! Laughed the whole way through.
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,Uganda Wish You Never Saw This Crap Show,"I actually feel irritated that I am bothering to even take the time to write a review for such a horrible piece of crap. I was pretty neutral on Chelsea Handler before watching this, leaning towards thinking she was raunchy but pretty funny.

Now, all I can think is what a ridiculous and pompous jackass. Enough already with flaunting your money. When I watch comedy, I like to laugh - not be insulted. I couldn't believe it when I was searching for more info about her and saw her net worth was $35 Million. That's the REAL joke - and a sick one at that.

I almost wouldn't have minded her constantly throwing her wealthy lifestyle around IF she had actually said something that was funny enough for me to laugh. I never even cracked a smile."
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,Amazing!!!,She is absolutely hilarious! Not sure what the other reviewers were watching. I guess if you don't get it you need to lighten up or they just have some sort of personal feelings towards Chelsea. I thought it was great!
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,She is not a comedian,Dont waste yer time on this unentertaining garbage
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,I don't get her or her comedy,"I watched this and didn't laugh once. I did feel like there is a laugh track. Her jokes are stale and basically she just complains the entire time about how everyone is stupid. Gets old fast. I don't understand how/why people find this woman funny. I watched her e show every so often and never found it funny. I also don't understand why she walked away from her show, wants to take a full year off, then return to Netflix for a interview show. Not many people know who she is so fading away for a year won't help. I hope she gets better and tries a real stand up tour-not a fake one with a laugh track. We will see what happens in about 8 months."
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,Lights are on but. . .,"Being all attitude is no substitute for not having a brain. I wanted to know what/who Chelsea was all about to I watched several episodes of her talk show and now I seen her stand up. In sum, this show confirms for me that Chelsea Handler is the liberal air-head version of Meghan McCain."
Chelsea Handler: Uganda Be Kidding Me Live,You kidding me?!?,"My god, this is terrible. Most of the people I know are funnier than her. Most in fact are way funnier. Why would I waste my time watching a woman perform who isn't in the least funny? She's making me cringe - for her. There's no brains behind this, that's the main issue. She's like the not-so-intelligent, obnoxious tipsy acquaintance I try to dodge at parties. The kind I feel embarrassed and a little sorry for. I admit I gave up pretty soon."
Motown Magic,,
The Letdown,,
Orange Is the New Black,Enjoyable and very relatable,"After two episodes, I have warmed to the premise of this show. It offers an amusing and fairly convincing glimpse into the experiences of childbirth and early-parenting, and it seems to hit its targets more often than it misses.

Audrey is the new mother at the center of the story. Much is made of her feelings of inadequacy and inferiority, especially when surrounded by mothers for whom it seems to come all too easily. The first episode rolled out an admittedly predictable roster of clichéd mother-types to stand as Audrey's peers - the ambitious career-mother, the perfect angel-mother, the airhead hippy-mother - but to its credit, the show seems willing to push beyond these thin characterizations, allowing us to see the insecurities that prompt mothers to produce confident and overachieving facades. As Audrey learns this, she herself emerges as more capable and self-assured. It is a positive portrayal of motherhood and parenthood, and I hope that The Letdown continues to pursue this message through its run.

I will also watch in hope that the show does not eventually succumb to lazy stereotypes with some of its characters. So far, only brief glimpses have been offered of a young Asian mother and a non-gender binary parent (who prompts a not-very-tolerant eye-roll from other characters). As the show develops, it may give sharper focus to these characters - it would be a shame if they faded into the background.

Of course, a show like this is compulsory viewing for anyone who is recently a parent, but I think its message remains true for anyone, as it is one of those rare programs that succeeds in making our failings and frailties sharply entertaining. I will be watching with interest to see where it goes from here."

Orange Is the New Black,Finally a 'real' looking show about motherhood,I'm two months after giving birth and really needed a show like this that feels true Very funny
Orange Is the New Black,Australians nail humour,"That part of the world. Films or tv are effortless and so damn funny, for me it has workin moms vibe without the arrogance. Really enjoyable fun tv that passes time 😊"
Orange Is the New Black,A brilliant comedy with an unflinching look at the early years of motherhood,"The series doesn't shy away from the hard things about being a freshly minted parent.

About your needs being subservient to your child, about not equal load of expectations and responsibility in the household, about money being much more pressing issue.

It views the parenthood as a pressing need to make compromises, to let go of your life expectations from before. But through that you get to live another one.

It is so finely written and acted that it cannot be recommended enough."
Orange Is the New Black,Enjoyable,"I like the show, love the grandmother, but find the main character hard work, annoying, unlikable and unsympathetic. Usually if I can't get on board with the main character I'll ditch the show, but I really enjoy everyone else. I generally enjoy Australian shows."
Orange Is the New Black,"Funny, bittersweet and true","Found this on netflix. Am sorry there are only six episodes. This had me laughing, but also made me think. Such talented writing, so accurate, the acting is excellent too. The Mother, just like mine made me grind my teeth in sympathy. I do hope they make more episodes it is just so good. The Australian production is so far ahead of our sad attempt with the BBC to cover this subject."
Orange Is the New Black,"A mixed bag, funny, relatable, but also a deeply disturbing insight into how feminists view the world","The show will try and pass off the man hating and the uber women ideology behind the script as jokes but they are deadly serious.

Still if you can look past the extremist indoctrination there is much in this show worth watching. The characters are great, the dialogue is believable and enjoyable. The stories fun and light-hearted.

Worth a watch, just come prepared for the leftwing PSA"
Orange Is the New Black,"""We're in a school zone""",Comentario no disponible
Orange Is the New Black,"Not good, not bad","It was a nice show, but every time I started watching a new episode I kind of felt sad and depressed. Particularly Audrey seemed to be a bit too clumsy and overwhelmed, as if overdone. The rest of the moms were somehow more relatable. One point which I certainly didn't appreciate was that the fathers/husbands were portrayed as almost spineless. Whatever happened, they were always so calm and cooperative, which is nice, but not realistic. They seemed more as a background and always agreed with their wives, a bit silly.

There were good points of course, but in the attempt to seem realistic, it kind of didn't.

And I'm a new mom so the experience for me is still very fresh."
Orange Is the New Black,"Can't stop laughing, sympthazing, and watching!","My kids are teenagers and though I started watching Bc a friend recommended it, I thought I would be over it, not so! Every parent, even person, can relate to the truths of life's greatest gifts, moments, etc, not feeling like a great all the time! This is done very cleverly, with tons of heart, and just the right mixture of humor and reality. I suggest u try the first episode and watch how quickly you start bingeing it and counting the days for the next season!"
Orange Is the New Black,Waste of Time,"This is just a string of poorly thought through comedy skits. If this is what passes as award winning comedy in Australia, no wonder their shows struggle on the world stage."
Orange Is the New Black,A mixed bag of emotions,"I have just finished watching The Letdown Season 1. It is a hilarious Australian sitcom that depicts the awkwardness of parenthood. The show follows the adventures of Audrey, a new mum struggling to adjust to motherhood while navigating an oddball mothers' group. The show features excellent writing, powerful storylines, and a strong sense of authenticity which bring a nuanced approach to parenthood. Some have called The Letdown the most realistic depiction of motherhood on TV. The show vividly captures the twilight zone period of new parenthood, where life is turned upside down. The Letdown puts a comedic spin on motherhood, making it an affecting portrait of motherhood with spoonfuls of comedy. While the show has its moments of brilliance, it falls short in some areas, making it a mixed bag of emotions. Overall, though, The Letdown Season 1 is a solid show that is worth watching."
Orange Is the New Black,Makes motherhood look depressing...,"I get it... Parenting is hard... But doesn't it disturb ANYONE at all that there isn't a single episode in which she actually enjoys motherhood or enjoys a magic moment with her baby???! Yes, parenting is exhausting, but also SO worth it. This show only shows all the BAD... Makes parenting seem depressing... Was hoping for a more optimistic fun view... Only great moment was the SAHM performance in ""Career Day""! Now that was a good one!"
Orange Is the New Black,It's worth a watch up to season 2 episode 5,"Up until the last episode it tracked well with real life situations. The final episode was very formulaic. Like ""how do we end the show?"" With cliches. The age old problem of ""we have enough good material for a season and half but not enough for two full seasons.""

The acting is very good. Alison Bell does a great job acting; her voice, delivery and her expressions are very comedic. Often times I would laugh at loud from something she said and the way she said it.

I'd love to see Alison Bell featured in another show."
Orange Is the New Black,Sweet and funny.,I love this show so much!! I'm American and put on the subtitles so I wouldn't miss anything as the accents and slang are different. But the problems of new parents are pretty much the same as thirty years ago when I had my own babies. The writing is clever and acting exceptional. Thank you!
Orange Is the New Black,We need more series like this.,"I wouldn't usually write a review but this show is just so good. Most series and movies make things unrealistically perfect, I enjoyed how raw and honest this show is, relatable and real. It is refreshing to come across something like this, nothing is dolled up, it speaks to the human in us all. And it helps us to accept ourselves in our imperfect and messy lives. It shows us that it is okay, and I feel this is needed in the world we live in. Where there are unrealistic expectations created for ourselves to be a certain way because of what we see in mainstream television. The negative impact it has on us it not given enough attention to.

I loved Audrey's character. She made me laugh a lot. The humour in this series is brilliant! I wish there were more series like this out there."
Orange Is the New Black,Very funny,"I watched the first season before I became a mom and still thought it was hilarious. It was only after I became a mom and watched the second season that I got the pun with the title. Haha. This show is so much better than Working Moms. Worth a watch, regardless of whether or not you're a mom."
Orange Is the New Black,ALOT better than Canda's try.,"I loved this series so much, as a FTM to a 1 year old, I found it so relatable. I love that it goes through the struggles us mums have in such a raw but funny way. The writers and actors have done so well depicting this side of motherhood. It shows that mums can come in all different shapes and sizes and we do mess it up sometimes but we are trying our best! After I had finished this series on Netflix, I did watch ""Working Moms"" which seemed to be Canada's try on a similar story line, but compared to ""The Let Down"" they really missed the mark on theirs. 110% would (and have already) recommend!"
Orange Is the New Black,Good and bad,When it's funny it's good. Of course it has a tendency to veer heavily into truly angry savage man hating
Orange Is the New Black,Funny & Refreshing for Parents,I watch the first two episodes with my husband last night and we laughed so much. It is very serious too. I think parents will think its funny but others may not understand the humor since they have not gone through it. It is refreshing to see something so open to the challenges of parenthood. I am excited to see how far they take it. I hope they make new episodes
Orange Is the New Black,A beautiful and brutal true insight to motherhood!,I'm not sure ive ever witnessed a truer account of daily struggles of motherhood from all perspectives! Almost felt like I was watching from the inside out! Beautifully written and orchestrated and humorous yet achingly deep! Honesty is the best policy!
Orange Is the New Black,Irreverent look at first-time parenthood,It's hilarious - showing real humor when talking about the unanticipated realities of parenting a new baby.
Orange Is the New Black,Mums and Dads getting used to life with baby while mourning their old life,"This show is brilliant, very funny and relatable. I could relate to every episode in some way or form. The one consistent thing is no sleep for mum or dad and the constant advice from strangers to your parents!"

Badanamu Stories,,
How to Ruin Christmas,Good enough,It's an average mini series which is easy to watch but it lost me when they did the cliche trope of making the characters have a conflict which would be resolved in the 3rd act and what made it worse was that the conflict wasn't compelling nor unrealistic
How to Ruin Christmas,"Urban, Hip, very South African & realistic Fiction","It's just brilliant. If you've ever wondered what the rich and famous this side of the world get up to, This is it. The characters are lovable and believable"
How to Ruin Christmas,Fun,"Structurally imperfect but definitely not your typical Christmas romance glop. Funny, touching, dramatic and leaves you hanging, light hearted fun"
How to Ruin Christmas,Loved it!,This was an incredible tell. Seeing the traditions blended into a modern love story really was refreshing. Well done. I look forward to the series continuing.
How to Ruin Christmas,Disappointing,"I kept watching this show hoping it would get beter. The script is horrible and they trying too much. The first 3 minutes were so good I was about to share on my IG but the more I kept watching the more disappointed I become. Their is always room for improvement, work on the script and the acting and also the story line is all over the place."
How to Ruin Christmas,At last! A great South African series,"Heartfelt, relatable, considered characters. Well produced, consistent delivery on quality throughout. Simple but well-executed. I love me a good old fashioned rom-com, but this one had that South African flavour, so it felt like home! (Although less comedy than drama tbh) Common cultural issues were navigated with sensitivity and a light touch. Also, did I mention the outfits, sets and cars were high-class!?"
How to Ruin Christmas,A realistic funny show,"This show is comedy gold, especially for those who understand the culture and how weddings come about. There are some elements that do not work well in the show but they are not major drawbacks but I was in shreds for three episodes and the show managed to comment on how we often forget that the point of the wedding is not the spectacle but the two people getting married. I feel that some jokes will be lost to non-South Africans but it was a well executed show."
How to Ruin Christmas,Loved it!,Highly entertaining with depth to the characters and quality acting to boot! Also loved the wardrobe choices specifically those mauve bridesmaids dresses. The guy that played the cheating husband- brother could've been more attractive to make it more palatable/believable but I got over it. I didn't get why she brought the old guy with her to the other bar but whatevs. Looking forward to seeing more seasons!

How to Ruin Christmas,Amazing,"Everything about this production is 120% the music, plot,acting !!! Konke nje love 120% Proudly South African .... I love how authentic it is, the americanized themed productions bore me shame."
How to Ruin Christmas,This just worked,"As a South African, I connected with this story at so many layers. As a young person, as a married person, as a person from the Township, as a person living in a city. The drama and story arcs for each character were hyper realistic in a South African context. The cast was also perfect for the roles, no one felt offish. I highly recommend it. I hope they used the same writers and directors for the follow-up."
How to Ruin Christmas,Feels pretty authentic,"From the speaking of so many different languages, to the throwback Kwaito tunes, to getting to see various cities in SA, How to ruin Christmas feels more authentic than most other mainstream African shows. The wild plots, humor, and sentimental moments make it easy to get hooked into."
How to Ruin Christmas,Great!,Great casting! Great acting! Great comedic relief!
How to Ruin Christmas,Entertaining and funny,"Nice series, not the best plot but l'd recommend it."
How to Ruin Christmas,Loved it,I absolutely loved watching this waiting for more episodes.
How to Ruin Christmas,Loved Seeing Tradition,"This was fabulous! Laughed and cried. For those of us who were denied the ability to continue important tradition, the end brought pride as well as sadness. Good show! Can't wait for season 2."
How to Ruin Christmas,See it for yourself,I thought it was fun and grittier than I had expected. Tumi needs a whop on the behind. Full grown but I can't tell. Relatable. Watching her struggle was painful ly funny. Want to watch it again
How to Ruin Christmas,Lmao,"If you can relate, you can relate 🤣 Really funny & good production quality. Well done guys"
How to Ruin Christmas,"Beautiful, fun, rich & effortless","The show effectively reaches the depths of real family pain points and true individual fxck-ups, while maintaining its foundation of humor and beauty, which is also how the main character moves. She's at the center of all of those struggles personally and at some point in the show's timeline, and there is no ""gotta love her,"" moment to balance when she's flat out wrong. It took no work to embrace each character as human, as they weren't presented as oversimplified for good, bad, or ugly (and it gets ugly!). The acting was impeccable and everything is gorgeous. The culturally relevant imagery and audio was rich, from the mixed-language script to the music, hair, and daily clothes to ceremonial garb. I loved it all and look forward to the next episodes/seasons!"
How to Ruin Christmas,Loved it,I loved it. I watched it three times. I have told people to watch it they enjoy it as well. It is so South African.
How to Ruin Christmas,Great Watch!,"I loved this! This was a nice story with the perfect amount of romance, fantasy and realness. Please add more!!"
How to Ruin Christmas,Such a ride!,There are masterful comedy moments with beautifully raw and sensitive moments. I'm glad I ignored it's overall rating and gave it a chance. It is a fun and uplifting series.
How to Ruin Christmas,Love it,Loooooove it! I just wish it were longer than 3 episodes
How to Ruin Christmas,Absolutely Loved It,Stunning.... everything from the cast to the production itself
How to Ruin Christmas,Left me wanting more👌🏿👌🏿,"The is not a lot of shows I can seat and watch with my wife and sisters in law..yes not even during Covid-19 lockdown and Festive season, this treasure however was able to kept us glued and left us wanting more, my wife rated it a South African 'Insecure', great performance from actors, it has humor...yes even South African kind, family scandals,drama,calture..it leaves you feeling happy that you don't have a family member like Tumi, at same time longing for her type of friendship,it's a shame it takes big distribution like Netflix to provide us with such quality talent+story telling SABC is clearly failing to provide"
Somewhere Between,Stick With It,"This is a strange little tale. It starts off badly, very badly. Hyper annoying children combined with some poor acting and a weak script almost had me close to turning off. Fortunately Episode 1 is no more than a premise set up and things improve significantly as the series progresses. An unbelievably drab looking Patton (still gorgeous) and Sawa as a burn out ex-cop do a decent job holding this together. It's not rocket science, but worthwhile for passing some cold winter nights in front of the TV."
Somewhere Between,Nice television series.,Comentario no disponible
Somewhere Between,[6.8] A bumpy ride,"A sort of lame mystery/drama series with sporadic good acting (besides Laura), somewhat interesting storyline, lots of cliched and useless dragging and an overall average flow.

It is not serious, doesn't have a thrilling vibe, but nevertheless, is mildly entertaining for a pass-time."
Somewhere Between,bad bad acting,"Goodness what a bad actress! Every move she makes is way over the top! The story is good but she is so over the top. Acting is about giving a subtle option to a situation. She is all over the place I think she needs acting lessons She needs to review her acting presentation She sighs all the time, her every facial expression is over the top which makes the viewer conscious of the fact that she is over acting. the other actors are OK which brings her exaggerated performance even more into discussion. enough!"
Somewhere Between,average show with a very bad acting lead actress,"This is not the most intense, most interesting TV show there is.. but it is not that bad as some reviews claimed.

The story is quite predictable as I get to episode four, I can already guess who is the bad guys here. The show has somewhat fast pace which is good, not much twist and turn but with some actions. This is a killing time kind of show. I can tell you there are way lots of garbage show in Netflix than this one.

The only thing that will hinder you from continue to kill time with this show is the lead actress - Paula Patton, i do not know how she became an actress, maybe the trend now is actresses cant act, singers cant sing..

She consistently has that ""trying-so-hard, over-the-top"" look on her face for the whole 10 episodes, her hairdo doesnt help either, she looks kind of old and haggard to be the wife of that DA guy. Even the child actresses (Serena & Ruby) acts better than her. And that Serena character is a spoil brat who is a constant pain to watch too. Seriously, Should have fired the casting director and probably the director for accepting such sub-par acting."
Somewhere Between,Give it a try & don't listen to all these bad reviews!!!,"Okay, so I actually NEVER review shows but come on people!? Somewhere Between is actually a really interesting show with dynamic characters and boat loads of suspense. I'm confused by all of the negative reviews.

No, I've never seen the original Korean series so I didn't have the same expectations going into this. However, I did read these reviews. I actually deleted my recording and wasn't even going to give it a chance. Thankfully my parents told me they loved it. So I watched the first episode... then the second... then the third. My only complaint? I can't binge the rest of the series yet.

Is it the best show I've ever watched? No. Is it good TV? Yes.

I recommend you give it a try as well."

Somewhere Between,worth a watch,"I am glad i did not read the negative reviews before watching this show as i might not have watched it. I enjoyed every minute and was hanging waiting for the next weeks episode, It had its twists and turns that kept you interested week to week i have never reviewed a show before but felt that this show did not deserve all the negatives it is receiving if you like crime/thriller shows you should enjoy it"
Somewhere Between,Very Interesting,"I feel like this is one of those good series which will end up getting cancelled because of lack of enough viewership. It has a very good storyline which i like, if they manage to make it to season two they need to add more characters, i'm interested to see how the rest of the episodes will play out but for now it is a 7/10 for me."
Somewhere Between,Worst Lead Actress,Exactly as the headline states. Paula Patton's pathetic attempt at acting has ruined what could of been an astounding series. Her over the top facial expressions and emotional character reactions are beyond poor acting. It is such a pity as the rest of the actors would of pulled the story and show off and made it a 'Much Watch'
Somewhere Between,Edge of the seat stuff,"This series is very exciting. To emphasise a point about the bad reviews, a reviewer said the acting was bad. Ruby was given an award for this and her acting as a special needs child is superb. Serena was also very good but Ruby would have been a more difficult role. All the actors were very good. Their characters were convincing and believable. It kept me enthralled from beginning to end. Ignore the poor reviews as they are misleading and wrong. The style of acting suited the series as it was a thriller and dangers abounded."
Somewhere Between,Still watching,"I'm on episode 4 currently and will change the rating as necessary. I absolutely hate Paula Patton as an actress. If they give her too many lines, the movie tends to go downhill. It's better that she just try to be sexy and not act...... moving on.... it's a good story plot. But I can't stand movies with kids acting all grown and talking back. That little girl would've had a beat down a few times. That's it."
Somewhere Between,Good story but bad acting by leading female actors,Comentario no disponible
Somewhere Between,I always finish what I start!,"Ok. I watch a lot of tv. Having a son with depression and anxiety issues, I don't have much of a social life. I also am very eclectic when it comes to what I watch & am willing to try anything! If it's good it's good. I pride myself on formulating my own opinion but I must confess I do read some ratings before watching something. More to see what people say & how they express their opinions, rather than the rating itself! I have given this rating on the 1st episode, as I do agree somewhat worth a lot of you self appointed critics. In they there is a fanominal amount of over acting going on here! Also, yes the child actress is already getting on my nerves! That said, I think the plot & story has potential in it's idea. So I am going to keep watching & see where it goes. Will almost certainly rate it again when I finish the series!"
Somewhere Between,It improves..keep watching.,"I watched episode 1 and nearly gave up. So glad I kept watching it, it really improved. Episode 1 was so bad, maybe it was poorly put together, I don't know...but do watch after. The girls acting improves."
Somewhere Between,Good story with cliche plot lines and bad acting.,"The series starts out slow, I put the story develops nicely. Most of the acting is decent, but Paula Patton really can't act well. Even the kid actor does a more convincing job of acting than Paula Patton. Too many plot twists are cliche, corny and predictable, but still it was a good binge watch on Netflix."
Somewhere Between,Terrible Actress,"I agree with most of these reviews that Paula Patton is way to over the top in this series. It makes the show so hard to watch because of her. I believe the best part of the show is the actor playing Nico Jackson, everyone else is ridiculous. I quit watching after 4 episodes because I could t take Paula Patton's extreme facial expressions and unexplainable acting."
Somewhere Between,Don't Listen to those Haters,"I didn't read the review first. I watch episode 1 and didn't know if I was going to like it but since I have Kodi I watched the next 5 episode in row and was hooked.

To the reviewers that gave low stars - it is like going to a new restaurant and not having a great experience, you need to go back a couple of times until the kinks are worked out.

You need to watch more than episode to get a good experience and enjoy the show."
Somewhere Between,Hard to watch,"I gave it a fair shake but the acting is really bad , especially the little girl. Storyline and plot were sub-par as well."
Somewhere Between,So bad that I had to write my first review,"The story is very appealing and that's what got me into watching the series. As I'm writing this, I am finishing the second episode.

First two minutes into the show I thought how bad the acting is. I've seen the main actress in few movies and her acting skills were okay, pretty average but not bad. But in this show! Oh my! But let's be fair, no one acts good in this show.

Too bad for this good storyline."
Somewhere Between,It's actually very good,"Just finished watching the whole season with my daughter, we've been watching an episode each night for the last couple of weeks - and both thought it was really very good indeed.

Logged onto imdb to see what others thought and was surprised to see people giving it low marks, seemingly mostly from people who made up their mind after the first episode & couldn't get over the acting or 'annoying' kid.

Tbh I thought the acting was fine, especially good in the later episodes. Didn't find the kid annoying at all, she was adorable & did well, again moreso towards the end of the series as things got more serious.

The story was very good, kept twisting & turning and had us guessing throughout. Plot seemed simple at first but developed into quite a deep & rich story. Found ourselves emotionally compelled & attached to the characters & their plights.

What I also loved about this show is that it had a proper ending! Everything wrapped up - no silly ""keep this open for season 2"", it was a proper good solid story! Great :-)

So yes, give it a go & stick with it you'll probably be glad you did."
Somewhere Between,Ruined by lead actress,"This could have been quite watchable if not for the incredibly bad acting of Paula Patton.

Every sentence is over acted and you wish she would be the next to be killed. The script isn't great but would have at least been watchable with someone other than Patton. No likeable characters in the entire series.

Somewhere Between,Nope...,"I pretty much agree with what everyone else has said. Paula Patton's acting is way over the top. The ""daughter"" is a complete brat with parents that don't ""parent"". The story is way too chopped up and so far doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

Husband liked it so we're watching the 2nd episode but I've already mentally checked out."
Somewhere Between,Wow!,"Listen to the negative reviews. The acting in this is terrible and the child is irritating af and needs a proper slap. Can't even finish the first episode, I'm just sat eye rolling at every scene!"

Always a Witch,Beautifully film teen novela,"Siempre Bruja is more of a teen telenovela than anything else. It's beautifully filmed in Cartagena, Colombia. I did enjoy the colorful landscapes and old Spanish fortress city. But teen dramas aren't really my thing. But I can see how many young people would liking this film a lot. I was hoping it had more of a comedic edge like Bewitch or a darker comedy instead of a Beverly Hills 90210 melodrama feel to it. It certainly makes me want to travel and visit this old city, its newer modern cityscape and experience the music, dance, colonial history and the street food vendors!

One of the reasons why I really love Netflix so much is that they bringing more international programming like this to the United States and to the rest of the world. I love their originals, but I also love this culture sharing that Netflix provides that Over-The-Air television has always failed to provide in the past. Hopefully this streaming company might do more than just entertain us, but break the American bubble of isolation and make our country a more internationally and culturally aware people."
Always a Witch,Please watch this in Spanish!,It's not bad! I really recomend to watching in Spanish with english subtext! Don't watch it bubbad! Estoy the culture and the beautiful Cartagena!! And the story too!
Always a Witch,Dreamy Esteban,"Pretty good series. I was able to binge it in a whole night. Series is great for teenager/young adult audience. The main actress was good. The character came out clueless sometimes but she is playing a young teenager. The actor who plays Esteban is so dreamy. He is my new tv character crush. I actually can't wait to watch some of his other work. If another season came up, I would love it just because of him."
Always a Witch,This could have been something..,"Gosh this looked like it would be magical. A black witch in 1600s Columbia (mind blown) casts a spell to avoid being burned at the stake and ends up in 2019 Columbia with the promise that if she gets an emerald to a witch there, that witch will end her back in time to before her love was killed in the 1600s. So Carmen does so and ends up in 2019. All is well but for the fact that soon after arriving and finding the witch to send her back, that witch disappears and is presumed dead. How does she get back now?

There are several problems with this series that might not bug you but bugged me. (1) for some reason, everyone on the show has the dialog dubbed. This makes everyone sound ridiculous. You will have an obviously latino man speaking like a white car commercial from the 1970s. It is horrible; (2) There is way too much talking about the baddie. They must say his name a zillion times but a lot of the story doesn't seem to advance the ball toward finding him; (3) there is just a modern day problem with this show... Carmen is a slave in 1600 and is in *love* with the slave master's son. It is hard for anyone in modern day to root for them to get together in the 1600s. You kind of want Carmen to stay where she is.

I do want to give them credit for doing a good job with someone from the 1600s coming to 2019. Carmen has problems adjusting but they are not over done. She learns fast and makes friends. I would put this in the watch for later queue."
Always a Witch,"Angely rocks as a beautiful, cool bewitched time traveler!","Solid production values for this first ever Columbian TV series I've watched. Initial episode was totally entertaining from the stake 'burning' to Carmen's arrival at a carnival atmosphere beach side celebration. characters and story held my interest. Look forward to further episodes with this charming, Colombian witch!"
Always a Witch,Too Much Authenticity Lost in Translation,"While the acting isn't stellar, it's not a bad show, but the voice-overs are kind of annoying. It is set in Cartegena for crying out loud. The actors shouldn't have American accents.Carmen slid into modern speak too easily--not with technological stuff, thank God, but the way she speaks is not from her era. I feel she should have struggled more with that."
Always a Witch,MISSED OPPORTUNITY!!!,Comentario no disponible
Always a Witch,Binged the whole show in 2 days,"Great show, the soundtrack is amazing, characters that you can get connected to, its just a good show overall. The plot is centered around love and loss with an exciting twist of magic and time travel. The first season only has 10 episodes at around 30 minutes each, I wish it was longer but it has a solid ending which leaves you satisfied while also leaving you wanting for more. I would recommend this show to everyone because of the mix of romance, action, mystery, a bit of drama and fantasy elements."
Always a Witch,Always a Witch,"This Colombian series opens in seventeenth century Cartagena where slave Carmen Eguiluz is about to be burnt at the stake for witchcraft. This is largely inspired by the fact that she is in a forbidden relationship with the son of wealthy Spanish family. The execution appears to take place but then she walks out of the sea... in the twenty-first century. We later learn she has made a deal with immortal wizard Aldemar... if she can save somebody for Aldemar she will be able to return to her own time and have her relationship. He warned her that there is a dangerous wizard who will try to stop her and somebody is murdering women accused of witchcraft. Once in the present she quickly makes friends and learns about freedoms she couldn't dream of before. Most of her problems seem to be sorted as the first season ends but more appear in the second season... Carman's friend Johnny Ki manages to use a time portal and returns with a seventeenth century pirate and a would-be witch is threatening Carmen's safety through her actions.

It must be said that while this series is quite fun it is also rather lightweight. Its cast are mostly good looking young people and even when major characters appear to be in dangerous situations nobody is likely to think they won't get out of it; the only question is how. The acting might not be the greatest but it is decent enough. The stories, which are season long rather than episodic, are fun. I think I preferred the second series slightly more; it is just as light weight but Kobo the pirate is a fun addition to the cast of characters. The city of Cartagena is a fine setting; modern but with a real sense of history. Overall a fun watch; it might not be a must see show but it passes the time nicely. The conclusion of the second season leaves an opening for further stories; if we get another season I'll watch it.

These comments are based on watching the series in Spanish with English subtitles so I can't comment on the quality of the English dubbing."
Always a Witch,Amateur hour,"I am sure that Colombia has very competent movie directors that would love to work with Netflix. Unfortunately they were not part of this work. First, although the idea has potential, the script is substandard. Second, the characters are poorly designed. Third, there is no connection between the scenes. One second a video is uploaded, the next second a crime is being reported. What crime? Who found it? Who uploaded the video? Nothing makes sense."

Always a Witch,"The dubbed version ruins it, just watch in Spanish with subtitles","I needed to watch something while I was down with a bad cold. I love a show with a black girl lead anyway, so I checked it out. It's a supernatural teen drama, but with an interesting connection to the past, as our heroine, Carmen, is a witch from 1649. She's a slave and in love with the son of the master. I cannot roll my eyes hard enough at this nonsense. I stuck with it and it's a fun show, it reminds me of BuffyTVS what with all the magic and friendship. I hope the second season has better writing around her slave past because right now, it's infuriating. The thing that kept me going was taking the advice to turn off the overdubbing and watch in Spanish with subtitles; OMG it's so much better. And Carmen has amazing hair,js."
Always a Witch,It was pretty good,Comentario no disponible
Always a Witch,Completely Binge Worthy,"I enjoy fantasy, especially stories of witches. This perfectly blends two worlds, past and present, to make an entralling story you'll want to watch to the end. Took one star away because it was dubbed in English. Would have liked to hear the actors real voices and read the captions along with it."
Always a Witch,All right,"I did enjoy this series... at first it seemed really promising, but it did go downhill a bit for me. A lot of things happened that didn't really make sense to me, but hey, I definitely liked it more than the new Netflix Sabrina series."
Always a Witch,Complete waste of time,"I actually felt disrespected enough by the lame acting, lazy direction and laughable story to create an IMDB account and warn everyone . Do not waste your time in this. Through the episode 1 you feel the Complete lack of interest in making a quality show."
Always a Witch,Refreshinginly Different,"As a paranormal television series it is different and delightful. The acting isn't the best; however, the storyline is thrilling and at times comical. I'm only on episode 7 so I don't know the ending to season one. I think it will be good. Like the other reviewers, I was hooked after the first episode and I'm sure you will be too."
Always a Witch,Binged the whole season 1 overnight,It's so magical and educational at the same time. I didn't know that Colombians are this good in creating a tv series.
Always a Witch,Worth the try,"Interesting story, good production and the whole series is entertaining. It could use better writing though. Some scenes look ridiculous. Overall, the result is good. It's entertaining enough and touches the issues of slavery and women's rights in a way that makes you think instead of making you feel guilty. Please prefer to watch this in Spanish. The original language is always better."
Always a Witch,"Bad Acting, Bad Voice-Overs","Uh. I can't find ANY good Sci Fi or fantasy lately. This wasn't good at all. Firstly, it has to be translated into English. The people doing the voice overs did a terrible job. The production on the show was ok, but badly edited. Then, you have to listen to the bad acting on the voice overs which makes this unwatchable. I made it through 20 minutes, then went to find something else to watch."
Always a Witch,I DIDN'T WANT TO STOP WATCHING!,"Wow please bring a season 2. I love this show. It is so good I wait for there to be a season 2. I so hope! Keep this going please. I enjoyed the story-line also the acting. This is so different from other witch shows. This is not a sexualized show or a whole lot of body showing. This show focused on the story and you get good acting. You have no idea where it's going and that is good. You will be surprised! It also offered some comedy with Johnny Ki's character.

Overall this is a show to watch and I'm waiting for a second season."

Always a Witch,Really messed up black history month on this one.,A black witch goes to modern times and falls in love with her slave master. The writers couldn't be more ignorant if they tried.
Always a Witch,Colourful teen drama,"Love the setting of the beautiful old city, the everlasting summer, the skimpy tops and the rum, the silly and cute acting, the predictable story, time traveling and catchy music. Perfect entertainment in the semi background a gray winter afternoon. The story telling must be right somehow and I do find the characters likable. Want to see more. Gib me season 3 right away plz? It's not the best thing ever but I could easily watch some more."

Glitch Techs,Pure Unbridled Fun,"Glitch Techs is a very, VERY good cartoon and might be the best thing Nickelodeon has put out in years. Despite a few uses of outdated gamer slang at times as well as the phrase ""Like a boss"" at one point (although to be fair it was said by a character that was meant to be obnoxious), the writing is solid overall with quickly paced delivery that works most of the time, with characters that complement the writing very well. Five and Miko are very charming and well developed protagonists, and not at one point do they border on annoying or intolerable. The music is also fantastic, it might be one of the best soundtracks to an animated show I've heard in a long time. And the animation is STUNNING. The lighting and colours are eye popping and the fluidity and kinetic energy of each action scene is truly a sight to behold. It's been a long time since there's been a major action cartoon, but Glitch Techs looks to fill in that gap. I hope that more people see this as we only have nine episodes so far and more should definitely be made. Please support this show if you want more original animated content in the future."
Glitch Techs,"Imaginative, Fast-Paced & Fun: Glitch Techs is A Must Watch for Any Animation Fan","After a rather abysmal decade, it looks like Nickelodeon is hitting the round running in 2020 with Glitch Techs.

The premise of the show is a solid one: Hector (High Five) and Miko are two teenagers who, through a surprisingly complex series of events, end up as Glitch Techs: soldiers who use high tech weaponry in order to battle rogue video game code (glitches) that manifests in the real world.

Right off the bat, the art style of this show is fantastic. It's vibrant, stylized, and really helps to convey the overall tone of the show. The animation fluctuates between smooth and intentionally choppy which helps to give it a very distinct and unique feel, and the electronic and glitchy music fits the show like a glove.

Next, there's our two lead characters, Five and Miko, who are a lot of fun to watch together. Five's analytical personality contrasts well with Miko's high-energy and excitable nature. Throughout the course of the first season (the only one available as of the writing of this review), Five and Miko grow and learn with and from each other all while battling cool-looking digital monsters via some of the best action choreography I've seen in an animated series in years.

The writing in the show is relatively simple and straightforward (aside from the double-length pilot episode) but manages to be engaging and character-focused without slipping into overly-childish or obnoxious territory. Both of the lead characters are well fleshed out and play off of each other extremely well.

Being a show heavily themed around video games, Glich Techs is especially fun for those who are avid gamers, containing fun references to everything from Pokemon and Castlevania to Metal Gear Solid and Street Fighter. The sheer passion that Five and Miko hold for video games is one that can be related to by anyone who happens to love them as well.

For Glitch Techs, it feels like the creators took elements from Danny Phantom, Ghostbusters, Men in Black & even Scott Pilgrim and rolled it all into one upbeat, eye-catching, action-filled romp that any animation fan, gamer or no, should be able to appreciate. In a way, I'm almost sad that Nick decided to relegate this show to Netflix. A series of this quality is exactly what their *actual* channel needs at this point. If there is any one thing I can fault the show for, it's that some of the dialogue can come off as cringy or trying a tad too hard to pander to the Gen Z crowd, but this is an extremely minor complaint.

To sum it up, Glich Techs is an extremely fun and satisfying watch and I cannot wait to see what Eric Robles and Dan Milano have in store for season 2."
Glitch Techs,Finally an animation and plot that stirs something inside,"I rarely review anything online but this show had me hanging on to whatever I had nearby cause it has a loooot going on in it, starting with an amazing OST + animation, the plot has a couple of holes that you can quickly ignore due to the amazing gaming references and battles going on, not only actual but retro too, the retro feeling is never lost, even when they are supposedly dealing with advanced tech, I hope they really develop this series into something solid and not let it die cause It's been a while since anything good that screamed nostalgia aired, specially from nick, the plus is that the animation is on point boiiii."
Glitch Techs,Support this show if you want more original Nicktoons,"Animation - The show's animation is extremely fluid. It helps that it comes from the same animation studio that animated Rise of the TMNT, which also has beautiful animation. It also has a nice color palette that's easy on the eyes, and good geometric character designs.

Writing - The show has fairly good writing. The story is engaging and unique, and the dialogue is sharp. There's also a lot of video game references to stuff like Pokemon, Sonic, and Castlevania for all of us video game nerds out there.

Characters - The show's characters are also well-written, and get a lot of development. Five and Miko genuinely seem like real people that you would meet and have a lot of traits to round them out, as well as a good dynamic with each other. Bitt is adorable, and Mitch is the guy you love to hate. The only problem is that Zahra and Haneesh don't get enough screen time or development, but hopefully they will in future episodes.

Music - The show's music really stands out. It's 8-bit and inspired by retro video games, obviously. The opening theme and credits songs are both really catchy.

Enjoyment - The only problem I have is that it drags sometimes due to being 22 minutes and not 11 minutes, but overall it's a fun show with a compelling story, great action scenes, smooth animation, likable characters, everything you need to make a great Nicktoon. It's a crying shame that Nickelodeon screwed it over and dumped it on Netflix. Everyone complains that Nickelodeon doesn't come up with original ideas anymore when this show and the new show It's Pony exist. Support both of those shows if you want more original ideas from Nickelodeon."
Glitch Techs,"very very good, glitch techs","This show is really amazing, Animation 10/10 Story pfff just PERFECT

It seems that they learned the mistakes of fanboy and chum chum, to bring something from another level.

The sad thing is the choices Nickelodeon takes with his animated series, first Harvey Beaks, then welcome to the Wayne (super dead), Pinky Malinky (Netflix) and now Glitch Techs, is what gave Nickelodeon more freshness. but as always, nickelodeon with bad decisions as always, I just hope that with the new president everything is fine ..."
Glitch Techs,Best show on nick!,This is my favorite show on nickelodeon! It's way better than a lot of other shows on television right now. Nickelodeon should make more shows like this.
Glitch Techs,Glitch Techs Is freaking Amazing,The show is really amazing the animation is Great and Smooth The characters looks cool the story and writing is perfect The creator of Fanboy and chum chum really improve from his previous show i can admit i used to like fanboy and chum chum as a kid I'm very suprised that his new show is great this is a huge improvement !!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH
Glitch Techs,Such a good show,I hope there is a new season! it's so good you should watch it. it's an action/ comedy/ adventure! MUST WATCH
Glitch Techs,We need a season 3,Come on Netflix and Nick. This show is amazing and needs a season 3
Glitch Techs,Needs A Few Patches,"The basic premise of this show is Men In Black but with video games and that alone had me intrigued. The show itself though, while definitely being stronger than Nickelodeon's recent output, is held back by basic writing, unfunny humor, and the worst written rival character since Dio from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.

Glitch Techs stars Hector Nieves (High 5) and Miko Kubota (Me KO), 2 teens given the opportunity to fight glitches that take the form of digital monsters. High 5 is likable enough with his knowledge of video game mechanics and his eagerness to learn. However, it's the Costello to his Abbott that really steals the show. Miko is a wild, rambunctious, and fun character that loves her job as much as she loves playing video games. In addition to that, she's very relatable to me as she's the middle child in her family and her relationship with her siblings and mother bring out the most heart in the show.

Visually, this is up there with some of Nickelodeon's best animation. The vibrant colors and fluid movements bring make the action scenes pop and the animators get really creative with the battles. The character designs bear similarities to series co-creator, Eric Robles' previous Nicktoon, Fanboy and Chum Chum. This time around, the characters are designed more for an action show as opposed to a slapstick comedy. Characters have more human-like body structures, yet every now and then some cartoony faces and gags are thrown in for an attempt at humor.

The writing and storytelling in this show is surprisingly basic. The plots of each episode are simplistic and predictable, and they drag because of it. It wouldn't be much of a problem if the supporting characters were as interesting or fun as the main characters. Sadly this is not the case. Phil is nothing more than the typical boss who gives the assignments and commends the heroes on a job well done. BITT is just another A.I. that's only there to do what he's programmed to do. Miko's sisters and mother are handled better, but only in subsequent episodes after their first appearance. And Ally is Miko's digital companion pet, because why not? To be fair, Ally does make for a cool pet, but when a bird is the best supporting character on a show, that's not good.

Then there's Mitch Williams, the one character that single handedly brings this show down. Seriously, if it wasn't for this one character, I would've been more kind to this show. Mitch is every bit as unlikable as Miko is fun. He's rude, selfish, egotistical, stubborn, careless, a liar and a cheat. While he occasionally gets dunked on, the fact that he get's off Scott free just makes me hate him even more. If he was the villain, or working for the main villain of the show and was working under cover, that would make sense. But rather than take that route, the showrunners felt as though he has to be a mainstay for the main characters to overcome. If the goal was to make the character unlikable, it backfired because he makes me want to stop watching. If this show gets another season, I would like to see Mitch get fired or have his memory wiped. Or better yet, just write him out of the show entirely; no explanation, he's just gone and he's never coming back.

4 years after being picked up by the network, it's unfortunate that Glitch Techs wasn't as good as I thought it would be. With excellent animation, solid voice work (especially from Monica Ray as Miko), and 2 likable leads, I'd forgive the basic writing if the supporting characters were more interesting or funny or if the plots weren't so predictable. But what truly brought this show down a rating in my book is the very character of Mitch Williams. While it's definitely one of the better Nicktoons in recent memory, it's unfortunately in the same camp as The Loud House: a great premise with a disappointingly average execution :/"
Glitch Techs,Funny and geeky for all ages,"I loved the show since the first minute watching it! It is so so funny that in almost every episode I was crying because of the goofy jokes.

I also loved that the characters grow and change through the series. Hope that we get a lot of seasons"
Glitch Techs,Mid,"Average kids show, inoffensive and basic

Animation and art are awesome as Flying Bark shows always are in recent memory but the rest is just your average episodic show with predictable plots and lessons

I don't think its bad or great, just average."
Glitch Techs,An amazing futuristic shows that I love!,"This shows reminds of my most favourite local shows, Ejen Ali. I hope this shows is the best one on Netflix!!! I hope some Malaysians watch this show! Recommended!"
Glitch Techs,No Glitch in This Great Show (Glitch means Problem),"Nickelodeon's previous animated show for Netflix, Pinky Malinky was pretty good, I mean I thought it was gonna be average but still, it was pretty good. Glitch Techs, on the other hand was way better than I expected. High Five and Miko are the two main characters who really love video games so much (even I'm a video game fan) and I really liked them as the actual main characters, (especially Miko, she's my favorite and she reminds me of Star Butterfly from Star vs. The Forces of Evil.) the animation is good, the background design looks great and both the action and comedy are rather well done. The co-creator of the show, Eric Robles (creator of one of Nick's worst cartoons, Fanboy and Chum Chum) did something right, I thought he was gonna mess up Glitch Techs with mindless Fanboy and Chum Chum humor but after what I saw from Glitch Techs, he made me satisfied. Seriously, go watch Glitch Techs on Netflix because it is easily one of the best shows ever made in western animation. I give Glitch Techs an 8.9/10"
Glitch Techs,Better what I saw in in recent years,"Better what I saw in recent years. Great storyline, best 2D animation. It's a pity that not many people see him, not a single animated series can be compared with this"
Glitch Techs,was better than i expected,"Awesome show, the first episode didn't sort of push me in but it still was OK, just from the second episode was just superb from mouth watery animations to funny and awesome dialogues between the characters and action scenes one thought you'd only find in anime or DC cartoons. This show honestly is worth checking out"
Glitch Techs,Thank you!,"Thank you for producing a show that doesn't relate to sponges, remakes or a 10 child family. Keep making shows that have humor and stories that are enjoyable."
Glitch Techs,Amaziiiiing!!!!,"Glitch techs was really great. I finished it today. Zahra, Miko & Five are AMAZING! Please have them more present:) #GlitchTechs was one of the best series I saw. Please make the third season of glitch techs faster. Tanks a lottt #NETFLIX #nikelodeon."
Glitch Techs,OK...This Is What's Good Now...OK,"This review is for the parents so kids you can stop reading now and click thumbs down, you're probably not going to agree.

Mom, Dad....Your kids are going to love this show. Maybe that's a good thing....maybe. It clearly has a video game theme, targeting the same audience. Quick dialogue, fast cuts, bright colors you get it. Shockingly, I view my son watching tv as a welcome break from him playing video games. TV has a lot to offer kids developing mind...this, coming from a career educator/administrator. Sure I'd prefer him read the many books we buy from book fairs but I'm being real here.

The description from Netflix tells you everything you need to know. No surprises here. Does not come close to Netflix's Last Kids On Earth show. I was hoping it did. It should be put in a time capsule with a note stating ADHD PROGRAMMING EXAMPLE FROM 2020. My son is loving it. What does that say about him? Or me? Maybe it's my generation that needs to adjust because his ADHD way of doing things will be necessary for multitasking vocations of tomorrow. Or maybe, that's what I tell myself so I don't feel guilty for not having the energy to fight the READING vs. VIDEO GAME battle everyday.

Kudos to the creators for knowing the pulse of their audience. But I'll take Scooby Doo any day over this. Your child won't be any brighter for watching...They may even lose some brain cells. But, it's our jobs to replace them. Just be sure to take them somewhere cultural or watch a foreign film with them afterwards ...I'm kidding, one episode of Jeopardy will suffice...Wheel of Fortune if you're from West Virginia;)

I'm from NJ - we get made fun of all the time so settle down!

My 9 yr old would give this an A I'd give it a C-

Hope tomorrow is a good one!"
Glitch Techs,This show is AWESOME,"This show is amazing! Great dialouges, great characters....everything! This show is damn good AMAZING"
Glitch Techs,great show,They really did it. I can't believe the guy who did Lame-boy and Dumb dumb did this. It is a must watch.
Glitch Techs,Best show on nick since avatar,This show is awesome. It is a love letter to video games. I love this show it is the show just reeks of talent. I love it.
Glitch Techs,This Show Is Amazing,This Was Almost Aired On Nickelodeon Are You Joking! This Show Would Have Been Canceled After One Season If It Premiered On Nick Give This Series The Respect It Deserves Because Now It's One Of My All Time Favorite Shows And I've Only Seen 9 Episodes The Animation Is Beautifully The Voices Are Fun And Charming The Characters Have Personality The Writing Is Funny It's Just A Overall Good Time

The Path of the Anaconda,,
Legends of the Hidden Temple,A returning viewer -- Great Gameshow,"I remember watching this show when I was a little kid (around 3 years old), and I remembered it fondly to present. About a month ago my family got digital cable, and I was flipping through the channels when I discovered the Nick GAS (Games and Sports) channel. On it was Legends of the Hidden Temple, the show I remembered fondly as a little kid. And it was just how I remembered it - it is an adventure show with six teams. Kirk Fogg is the host and Olmec is the talking stone head who gives them information to help them through the game. The first challenge narrows the field from six teams to four - it is the moat the teams have to get across. The first four teams move on to the steps of knowledge. Here Olmec tells a story about some historical figure and some artifact pertaining to that figure. After the teams hear the story, Olmec asks them questions about the story. The teams buzz in to answer and if they are correct they step down the steps. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly advance to the Temple games (semi-finals.) There are three games in the Temple games. The first two games are worth a half pendant of life. The third game is worth a whole pendant. Pendants can be used in the the Temple, when there is one team left, to escape from the Mayan Temple Guards. The team who has the most pendants after the Temple games goes on to take on the Temple. In the Temple there is a treasure, the artifact mentioned earlier in the story told by Olmec, that the team is trying to find and remove from the Temple within three minutes. You barely see any more game shows on Nickleodeon, like they had when I was a little kid, including games like Legends of the Hidden Temple. If you have digital cable at least you can still see reruns of the old shows on Nick GAS."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,An Instant Classic,"I remember I watching this around 1995 before it canceled, now I can see this stuff on YouTube. This classic features the host, Kirk Fogg, and the giant talking rock, Olmec. The first round contains the ""moat"" which features different obstacles, the first four teams move on the ""Steps of Knowledge"", which Olmec tells the myth or a historic moment, based on the artifact. Then the next two teams moves on to the ""Temple Games"" based on three events, one round features one boy on each team, round two features a girl on the team, and the final round features the full team for a pendent, Finally, the last remaining team enter the Temple to get the ancient artifact out of the temple. It was on Nick GAS since 1999, it was very enjoyable, and I got my cable in 2005, Unfortunately, Legends was removed from Nick GAS in 2007 (During the New Years Eve, where the channel has been completely removed). Bottom line: Fun game show.

1993-1995 (regular run) 1999-2007 (Nick GAS run)

Legends of the Hidden Temple gets 9 stars."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,This classic Nickelodeon game show of the '90s is a legend in itself.,"Double Dare may have been the first ever game show created for the first kids network and the most watched program in 1986, but this legendary game show which premiered in 1993 truly lives up to its name.

Olmec, the giant talking stone head, portrayed by Dee Bradley Baker, is the centerpiece of the entire show. He gives the legends about the lost artifacts the winning team gets to search for in an ancient looking Temple in each episode. My favorite round of the show is the Steps of Knowledge. I like watching the teams test their knowledge on the legends. But the Moat Crossing is more exciting to watch. You never know what the teams will use to get across that dangerous looking moat. And the Temple Games are even more entertaining when the two remaining teams test their speed and strength.

If there's one thing most fans of the Hidden Temple hated about the show and the freaked them out the most, it's those terrifying Temple Guards! The Temple Run, where the winning team gets the chance to run through Olmec's Temple to find the lost treasure, is got to be the most exciting part of each episode. You never know which rooms those Temple Guards would be hiding in, waiting to scare those adventuring kids out of their wits.

Another classic '90s Nick game show I also recommend that is just as exciting is Nickelodeon Guts."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Three Seasons of Childhood Fantasy,"For anyone who had access to Nickolodeon in 1993 and ever had a dream of becoming an archaeologist or adventurer someday, ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" was a dream come true.

A show went like this: six teams consisting of two ordinary kids would start out on a quest for some sort of item, usually a historical artifact such as a paintbrush belonging to Leonardo da Vinci. The six teams--the Red Jaguars, the Blue Barracudas, the Green Monkeys, the Orange Iguanas, the Purple Parrots, and the Silver Snakes--would line up and wait for the signal from the show's host, Kirk Fogg, cleverly dressed in ""adventurer"" gear. In this sample show, one team member has to paddle a boat across a pool surrounded by enough jungle scenery to qualify as a moat. The boat has a rope attached to it, and when the first team member gets out of the boat, he or she tied the rope around a pole. The second team member then had to walk across this rope with the help of a bar placed above the moat. As soon as the second player was on the other side, that player ran to a pedestal and hit the button on top. The first four teams to do so go on to the next round. The two slowest teams, the Green Monkeys and Orange Iguanas in this case, went home with $50 savings bonds.

Next come the Steps of Knowledge. The mysterious talking stone head dominating the scenery, aptly named ""Olmec"", would tell a story to the four teams. Kirk Fogg then asked questions about the story. Players stomped on markings in front of their steps to ring in and answer. The first two teams with three right answers move on to the next round. The Red Jaguars and the Silver Snakes go home with a pair of Skechers sneakers.

Next are the Temple Games, three physical tests such as crawling along a slick plastic mat while attached to a bungee cord. These were somehow incorporated into the story told by Olmec. There are two individual games and one team game. Each individual game won gives the team a half Pendant of Life (more on this later), while the team game awards a full Pendant. The team with the most Pendants at the end of the Temple Games wins the right to go into the Temple. The Blue Barracudas go home with two video games apiece, while the Purple Parrots go on to the Temple with a full Pendant and a half-Pendant.

The Purple Parrots now go into the Temple itself to try to get the artifact and get out of the Temple within three minutes. If they can do that, they get a trip to Space Camp. The paintbrush is hidden in the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. In the way are three Temple Guards who are assigned to three specific rooms in the Temple. The contestants go in one at a time. If a contestant enters that room, the contestant is ""captured"". The contestant can give the Temple Guard a Pendant of Life to go on, but if the contestant is caught without a Pendant, that player is taken out of the Temple and the player's partner must go into the Temple.

The first Purple Parrot, Joanna, runs in the lower entrance, the Cave. She crawls through to the Pit of the Pendulum, knocks over a column, and goes to the highest room of the Temple, the Observatory. A Temple Guard catches her there, but she has a pendant, so she can go on. She spins the compass and goes down to the Treasure Room. She opens the treasure chest and climbs down into the Swamp. She screams as a Temple Guard pops out of the muck to capture her. She doesn't have a pendant, so she must leave. Mitch must now run into the Temple. He follows his team-mate's path to avoid any Temple Guards and grabs the half-Pendant of Life hidden in the Treasure Room, giving him a full Pendant. He's safe now. He goes into the Tomb of the Ancient Kings and opens the sarcophagus to find the hidden key, then applies it to a tomb on the wall. It opens, and so Mitch climbs up...into the Shrine of the Silver Monkey! He grabs the paintbrush. Now all the doors are unlocked and the last Temple Guard is gone. He has thirty seconds to make his way back to the Temple Gate. He runs and runs and finally makes it back with two seconds to spare. They're off to Space Camp!

The Temple changed rooms often. There were picturesquely named rooms such as the Jester's Court, the Mine Shaft, the Crypt, the Tomb of the Headless Kings, the Hall of the Ancient Warriors, and the Throne Room, just to name a few. It was a good time and a new action adventure on weekday afternoons, all packed into a half-hour. I remember that I enjoyed the show very much, and if you have a chance to see a rerun (as on the Nickolodeon Games and Sports Channel), do so. You might be surprised by how much you enjoy it."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Best Show Ever Made,"Some things never lose their appeal. Scared, prize hungry 12 year olds, a giant talking Mayan statue, some goofy guy swinging from a rope, that silver monkey that nobody seemed to be able to put together, and some freaky temple guards all came together to make the perfect action game show on Nickelodeon. ""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" is an excellent game show that was featured on Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1995. Although hosted by Kirk Fogg, Legends is most famous for a much different host: a talking stone head by the name of Olmec. This television show will always be remembered for its creativity and its suspenseful action.

No matter what team won, you could have always done better then them.

oh and by the way there is a site selling the team shirts which is amazing.

Legends of the Hidden Temple,Fun game show,"I used to watch this show when I was growing up. First off, I must say that it was a fun game show. Also, I don't think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I remember the theme song very well, too. In addition, Kirk Fogg is absolutely drop dead gorgeous, which is one of the best things about this show. Even though it's finished its run, it's fun to play along and watch. I hope the Nickelodeon Games and Sports Network keeps it on so I can keep playing along and watching. If that happens, I will be really happy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I haven't seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Temple Run,"This is one of the aspects I miss about Nickalodon, the game shows. I always loved to watch most of the game shows on this channel because the concepts were always colorful, creative, there was physical activity involved, but most importantly fun. Out of all the game shows on this channel this show was my favorite.

In a way it was kinda a dream come true since I was a kid I was a big fan of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies and always had fun watching games shows like ""Fun House"", ""American Gladiators"", ""Double Dare"", etc. Putting both the ""Indiana Jones"" franchise and the concept of game show into a blender and it makes one hell of a drink. I remember as a kid I wanted to compete in this game just to go though the temple.

I really love the production value of the show from the amount of work and detail it conveys the pulp adventure atmosphere perfectly; all the sets practically really look like a hidden Mayan temple. The host was solid, but I really like the talking animatronic Mayan Omec. I just really like that voice which was just booming and conveyed wisdom.

Each of the team had some really cool names like Silver Snakes or Red Jaguars, which I'll admit almost sounded like the names of some high school or collage basketball or football teams.

The first challenges are trial by elimination where in one have to answer questions correctly to advance but we were all more interested in the physical challenges which were always something different. And actually did involve some intelligence because some of them where always the simple get this amount of balls into one bin within limited time. But some of them were actual puzzles, which just raised the stakes in the tension because they all had to think on their feet literally and that to me is what makes this game show great it really teaches a valuable technique on thinking in mere seconds while in constant action.

However the highlight no doubt is the temple challenge itself which is awesome. The challenge is literally a maze as contestants have to get from point A to B within a limited time frame. But of course as usual it's not as easy as that in fact it's a lot more complicated. The temple has two different pathways, each of the door to these pathways will continue to lead you forward or delay your progress.

Each of the sections are practically a mini puzzle or challenge, just to get a door open like one that was the most nerve racking would be the monkey which is a 3D Jigsaw puzzle where you have to put the head together perfectly, it's an easy puzzle to solve (by my standards) but it really can eat at your time. Also in a few sections a temple guard is hidden whom takes you out of the game completely, however if you have a pendant they let you pass, but like I said you have only one pendant when it's gone your vulnerable so whichever path you choose tread carefully. Also what raises the stakes are the fact that in each episode the temple will change one of the sections and each season the temple is changed completely, which really give the game an unpredictability element, which raised the tension up even higher for me as I was wondering how the heck the contesting is going to clear this or that obstacle or can they make it? I even like that there is a sense of audience participation in that part of the game, I'm always cheering and yelling for one contestant or another saying things, ""What are you doing, other way stupid!"" or ""Cmon your so close just keep going!"" It just always gave me a surge of excitement which I don't get often.

This is a temple worth visiting.

Legends of the Hidden Temple,"One of the best game shows out there, and a big childhood favourite","When I was a kid, this was my favourite game show, it had a lot of adventure and fun and had something for everything. And I have to admit I do miss it. Kirk Fogg was a great host, who clearly loves doing what he does, and the scenery is very well done. I also liked the music, and adored the concept which never outstayed its welcome. The contestants were also likable, and I loved the talking rock, he was cute and funny. I also loved the challenges, they looked challenging yet a lot of fun, and the team and room names which were incredibly creative.

All in all, part of my childhood and just a great game show. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Legends of the Hidden Temple,My childhood dream,"I remember watching this show when I was young, and for years all I ever wanted was to be on it. Sadly, no such luck.

This was a fun show that kept me and a million other kids coming back every week. I'm afraid I'll have to correct a previous reviewer that this show consisted of six teams and four rounds, not four and three. To trim the fat down to four, the teams had to cross a ""moat"" using some cleverly named ""ancient"" apparatus. Once across, four teams would listen to a giant stone head tell them a ""legend"" (normally a story from history, occassionally mythology), and answer questions on it. The crux of the game was an object from the ""legend"" placed in the temple. After that, the two remaining teams would do battle against one another to enter the temple. Prizes were won if the team retrieved the object.

Whenever I flip around and see reruns of this, I smile and remember my younger days. While this show of course won't have such meaning for anyone else who today watches it, it's always fun to suspend reality and root along something that happened 5-10 years ago. This show would still work if it were produced today (the target audience wouldn't care about repetition) just as it did then. A nostalgic show for me, a nice time for virtually anyone."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Brings back so many good memories,One of my favorite 90s shows on nickelodeon growing up this was definitely a one of a kind tv show
Legends of the Hidden Temple,My #1 game-show forever!,"I really love this show. I remember watching it when i was i think 4 or 5 (I'm now 15). My aunt and I would eat breakfast while watching it before I got to school. My favorite part was the temple run and the story telling by Olmec. Honestly, I didn't even know the name of Olmec for the first place but now I knew it and it seems familiar. I read my History book and Olmec is an ancient American tribe near the Mayan Ages (cool!) No wonder they make such a great show! I think what I watched since I was young was a rerun because I started watching it during 2001 and I was surprised to know that it actually started 1993 and ended on 1995. I was born 1996. I missed the original run yet I liked it... It's full of adventures! I miss Kirk Fogg, Olmec and the 1200 contestants who joined especially the one I liked :D .... I can no longer watch again even if there's a rerun because our channels nowadays are limited until 28. Nickelodeon here in the Philippines is in channel 35. But I would be happy to know if you will have a rerun this year. I can visit my mom or just ask my younger brother who lives in a separate house. Forever in my memories: Legends of the Hidden Temple."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Classic game show!,"Ah Legends of the Hidden Temple, the cream of the crop of Nick's game shows. I would wait until 6 p.m. to watch this and the wait was worth it all. While Guts had a lot of action for an enjoyable experience, Legends took it above and beyond to create a fabulous adventure to retrieve an artifact, just like in an Indiana Jones movie. My favorite team was the Blue Barracudas, but I didn't really care who made it to the temple. I regret not recording any episodes, but the loss was recently made up for thanks to a DVD release of old game shows. I will never tire of this show no matter how many times I see each episode (my all-time favorite is my first one: The Lucky Pillow of Annie Taylor)."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,An Old Favorite,"""Legends of the Hidden Temple"" has to be one of my favorite childhood game shows. It began right around the time I started first grade. I remember watching this show with my sister every time it aired. We both always wanted to be on the show.

The scenery of the game show was very well done and I loved Olmec the talking rock. He always introduced the new legend of that day. Host Kirk Fogg was also a very good host. My favorite team would have to be the Silver Snakes. That was an awesome name.

My favorite part of each episode was the fourth round: The Temple. It had a lot interesting rooms including the shrine of the silver monkey and the observatory. I give this show 10/10 stars."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,My favorite gameshow,I really liked Olmec the talking rock and how his mouth would move and his eyes would light up red. My favorite team was the Blue Baracudas. I think Kirk Fogg was a great host. I wish they would not have taken it off but i guess they had to make room for other shows. My favorite part of the show was the temple round but I also liked the part where they had to get to the other side of that moat thing. I liked how they had to go through the temple and get the parts of the silver monkey and how there were all those trap doors and stuff and when you least expected it a temple guard would jump out and try to grab them. I always wished I could be on the show.
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Memories....,"I remember watching this show when I was in like first or second grade (I'm about to be a junior now). I had probably forgotten it until I went to babysit and then I flipped to a channel (which now I know is the Nick GaS channel) and right there in front of me is one of my favorite shows as a kid. It was neat seeing the little animal teams (purple parrots, silver snakes, etc.) and the moat, and Olmec (who when I was little I thought his name was Old Mac so I would call him ""Big Mac""). It's such a cute show with the little temple and the cool rooms at the end. I would remember screaming at the TV at the kids who would have trouble putting the monkey in the ""Shrine of the Silver Monkey"" room because it didn't look very hard. And when I was seven I wasn't really thinking of it but now looking at it again I noticed Kirk Fogg is kinda cute too! Well anyways, it's good to see that's it's still atleast showing re-runs."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,not *really* gone,"Believe it or not, this show isn't really gone from the airwaves. Unlike what the previous person said, this show is indeed on Nick GAS and has been for a long time.

If you do not have the channel, don't worry, it should come to you.

Off the topic, Nick GAS is a channel that shows many old favorites from Nick's past. Double Dare, Super Sloppy Double Dare, etc. Not much is new.. and that's a very nice thing, mind you.

Legends of the Hidden Temple.. hmm.. it is really a good game show. Very well made. The host, Kirk Fogg, has the perfect voice for television. The only drawback is that about four teams get eliminated pretty quickly to go home with a pair of Sketchers shoes or something.

But Olmec's maze is just amazing. You know, the end when the last remaining team goes through a big maze of rooms and such. And they have to give a pendant to a temple guard if one ever comes in the precense of the room.

As corny as this sounds, it's pretty riviting sometimes. That's a lot when keeping in mind that this was aimed to children.. coming from a seventeen year old. Hah, whatever. These shows are appealing for the whole family, believe it or not."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,One of the greatest shows to watch but would have been even better to be on it.,"Your moving through a dense jungle. Moving big leaves out of your way. When you finally come to a clearing you see a giant stone head. Suddenly the eyes light up the mouth moves and it says with a deep booming voice ""Welcome to Legends of the Hidden Temple! Hosted by Kirk Fogg and here he is now."" A man that you can only assume is Kirk Fogg makes his entrance. As the crowd greets him with a thunderous applause he thanks them saying ""Thank you."", then turns to the stone head and says ""and thank you Olmec."" The stone head we now know is Olmec. Now that we are introduced to the hosts Kirk gives us a little summary of the game. He explains that six teams will have to face tough challenges in order to retrieve an artifact from the hidden temple. Then he turns to Olmec and asks what is the legend that they will be hearing bout today. Olmec in his deep booming voice responds. Then Kirk turns his attention to twelve children standing on the opposite side of pool of water. Each team is made up of two children. One is a boy and one is a girl and each of them are wearing a colored shirt with a picture of an animal on it. One by one Kirk Fogg introduces each team. ""The Red Jaguars, The Blue Barracudas, The Green Monkeys, The Orange Iguanas, The Purple Parrots and The Silver Snakes.

That was the beginning to a show called Legends of the Hidden Temple. The show premiered on Nickelodean in 1993. It lasted for three seasons. It was canceled in 1995. Why? I am not sure. This was one of the best shows I have ever seen. Not just on Nickelodean but on all of television. To this day there has not been many shows, or at least game shows, that has compared to this one. One thing is for sure is that this show is better than any other show that is on Nickelodean now. Not many things are what they used to be. The kids that are growing up now missed out on some good times. I wish things now where like the way they were when I was younger. Yes, I know I am in my twenties now but the things that where around when I was younger were so enjoyable that I could enjoy them now. Besides the show being a great show that anybody could enjoy at any age but I really enjoy this show because it was a part of my childhood. I remember watching it whenever I could and always wanting to be on it. When it was canceled I was a little upset but there were still other good shows I could still watch so it did not completely bother me but now that times have changed and there's not as many shows worth watching I really miss it. Then again even with a a lot of good shows worth watching if you had watched this show and had not seen it for awhile you would want to see it again. I know I did. When the show was canceled it was off the air for awhile. I had not completely forgot bout it but I didn't think bout it every day of my life. I finally got the chance to see it again when I was over a friends house and he had a channel that I did not have. Its name is NICK GaS. The GaS stands for Game and Sports. Whats great about Legends of the Hidden Temple is that it kind of fit into both of those categories. What makes Legends of the Hidden Temple so great is that its a show that is diverse. It has the six teams face four rounds of tough challenges that would require different skills such as strength, strategy, speed, memory, and wits.

There was never a dull moment. Every round had something special bout it. All around this is a great show and if you ever have a chance to watch it, DO."
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Great family game show,"This show is a classic nickelodeon game show. It had fun challenges and obstacle courses, and if you watched it as a kid, you can tune in too Nick Gas (Games and Sports) to see reruns of this fun show. Its also educational, with Olmac, who gives the history basis to the obstacle courses or the the thing you need to find. Great to watch with your family"
Legends of the Hidden Temple,Wow!!,"I remember watching this show clearly when I was about 11 or 12 years old. I'm 21 now, but I still remember how bad I wanted to be on this show. Not because I wanted to win cool prizes but because I wanted to meet the host, Kirk Fogg. I had the biggest crush on him and wanted to meet him so badly. That was the time when I used to read Bop magaines, you know, those magazines for pre-teens, I also bought Nickelodeon magazines to see if I found anything about Kirk Fogg, but sadly I never did. However, I did see him in alot of commercials and was happy to record them. Anyways that was years ago, but I will always remember the first tv host I had a crush on, Kirk Fogg!!"
Last One Standing,I love zombies so I gave it a try,"Idk what other guy yapping about in his review not even related to the show.

I like some bad shows and movies here and there so I watched few episodes but it really slow paced, low budget, and have average plot line. It felt like 90s or 20s movie I remember watching a movie similar to this having bats monsters as a child and I laughed so hard back then and laughed so hard watching this now. The weight of bats are around 5-10 pounds according to their size in the show and they are killing people with few bites even if they are venomous or infected it should take some time.

If they really want to do bat monsters they need to up their budget but in my opinion they aren't the best creatures to be monsters in the shows because of their small size and weight they don't really pose any real threat. It's cool idea though making zombies from bat bites and it came around the same time as corona outbreak which is weird.

And everyone is so dumb in the show they can easily fortify the train and stay there it has light, clean toilets, water, food, and comfy seats. It has to be the safest place but they chose to stay out there in crumbling old buildings. And they can easily reverse the train to get to the previous station. I guess the show wouldn't be made if it was smart lol. It's the same for most of these kind of shows and movies.

I'm giving a 3/10 for trying but people need to work on the script before making these mediocre shows."

Chosen,Christian Filmmakers Take Notice: THIS Is How You Do It,"I'm honestly really impressed by what the makers of this show have accomplished. It's such a unique take that they've given to the story, this sort of ""street-level view"" of those people that encountered Jesus. Reading these stories in the Bible again and again makes it easy to become detached from the fact that these were real people living real lives dealing with real struggles, going to work, hanging with friends, making jokes, eating lunch, and stepping in animal poop 😂 but they've brought it all to life in an engaging and relatable way where the tight budget seldom shows.

I love that this show doesn't feel preachy, like most Christian media. The way the camera kind of bobs and sways as it follows the action lends an almost documentarian vibe that makes me feel like I'm simply witnessing a story unfold. No agenda. No sermon. Just good old fashioned storytelling. Of course, we know that there is a very profound message to it all, but the filmmakers are smart enough to let the audience figure it out for themselves without thumping them over the head with ""Christian talk.""

The actor portraying Jesus does so with an unflinching kindness and empathy that makes him instantly trustworthy and lovable in every. single. scene. So props to him for his amazing work and props to the casting team for finding him!

This is a great show that, even if not suited to everyone's tastes, is bound to challenge our mental perception of these people and their stories. It makes these characters feel real, brings Jesus to life in a new way, and has some fun with artistic license while still honoring God's Word.

Christian filmmakers take note: THIS is how you do it!"
Chosen,Fantastic series with a fresh perspective!,Love how human the Chosen are! Totally relatable in today's world and they could have been any one of us. Thank you for this wonderful peek into history. A devoted fan forever! #bingeJesus
Chosen,A believable Jesus,"Following the progress of this idea from dream to reality, I was excited to have access to the first four episodes. This series is unlike any Biblical portrayal of the life of Christ to date - the characters are fresh and real- check out Abigail!! And a Jesus who winks! And doesn't glow or act ethereal! These first four episodes bring the Gospels to life in a way that immerses us into a culture and recounting that feels authentic. Kudos to everyone involved- I can't wait for more."
Chosen,The Best On-Screen Depiction of the Life Christ; Deeply Moving and Relatable,"Christian movies and shows aren't typically known for quality, good character development, or well-written, compelling stories. There are certainly some exceptions (e.g., The Passion of the Christ, I Can Only Imagine, Ben-Hur, I'm Not Ashamed, Faith Like Potatoes, The Case for Christ, and Narnia).

To cut straight to the point: The Chosen is far and away the best on-screen depiction of the life of Christ-either mini-series or movie. The writing and character development are exceptional. It's as captivating as The Passion, yet in so many ways more human and relatable. My family and I keep re-watching them just to get one more glimpse of the Son of Man. The miracles are deeply moving and will bring you to tears.

And now... the biggest problem is we'll have to wait for Season 2. The wait is going to hurt more than waiting for Stranger Things Season 3."
Chosen,An unexpected Treasure,"My wife wanted me to watch The Chosen with her, and I avoided it for weeks, because I expected yet another well-intentioned but 'cheesy' Christian production. Then I finally gave in. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. This production is amazing! The quality of the scripts, acting, and sets are all on a par with the production values of a well-regarded Hollywood 'short season' series. And the depiction of the historical culture and the conjectural backstories for key figures around Jesus are BETTER than anything I have seen elsewhere. If you are at all curious about a fresh take on the life of Jesus that still maintains rigorous effort to remain true to the New Testament record, I would HIGHLY recommend this series!"
Chosen,Beautiful!,"Well-written, well-cast, well-acted. So so happy this show exists."
Chosen,AWESOME on many levels.,"I've viewed the Christmas/Shepherd pilot and the first four episodes of season one. The extensive research into the life and times of Christ results in a high level of authenticity. Accuracy was a prevailing priority. The characters 'personalities are slowly peeled in layers through the episodes. There's stellar portrayals of some, especially when placed in the appropriate environs, and will leave a residue long after the video stops, . You will want to see more. There is a reason this series is the highest crowd funded video project."
Chosen,Loved every minute,You won't be able to stop watching. It is THAT good.
Chosen,A contender for the best depiction of Jesus ever to hit the screen!,"Is this a perfect show? No; what show is, especially in its first season? But is this a consistently entertaining, beautiful project (inside and out!) that not only brings the Bible alive, but takes a deep look at faith and what was really being asked of the 12 disciples when Jesus said, ""Follow me""? Yes, yes, and yes!

The actor who plays Jesus carries this season. Not only is he incredibly gentle and solemn when he needs to be, but he is funny (like actually laugh-out-loud funny!) and that is something many depictions of Jesus lack. Jesus' human side is explored in The Chosen as I've never seen before, so wholly and fully, yet in a way that is reverent and respectful. While we can imagine the Christ portrayed here being as human as us, we can also imagine him being as God as, well, God. Brilliant actor, and probably the best portrayal of Jesus ever put to film. His performance is controlled and unassuming yet so powerful in that alone. Whenever Jesus is onscreen you are completely captivated, hanging on his every word.

As far as some downsides in the show (which are in no way very glaring): Occasionally the humor did start to feel a little silly sometimes and took me out of the moment (rarely though, and never when involving Jesus and the disciples).

The score, while gorgeous in itself, has a sequence of a woman performing a vocal part that I felt was overused.

And I thought it a bit odd that the Roman soldiers have American accents, especially considering so much wonderful care is put into keeping the Hebrew accents so consistent. The lead ""evil Roman soldier"" fellow as well seemed cartoonish and I couldn't find him as threatening as he needed to be in this role, but rather he stood out from the others who are all far more developed and believable characters.

Yet these things do not detract from what a monumental moment this is in Christian cinema, or, lets just say cinema in general. To really see these disciples as real people was an eye opener and an encouragement to read the Bible again with new eyes. The actors playing Peter, Mary Magdalene, Matthew and I'll say each of Jesus' followers were masterfully done, perfect casting, and where did they find such unknown actors with such skill? I can't overstate how happy I am with this show and I really hope the show runners can get enough funding for a season 2. They are doing what Hollywood seemingly never could!"
Chosen,The most beautiful representation of Jesus I've ever seen,This series is just phenomenal. It speaks to the soul and represents Jesus in a wonderful and relatable light. God bless everyone behind the scenes making this show! You are changing lives!
Chosen,Excellent production,"This show is really well done. The story moves at a great pace, taking time to develop characters, but still moving the story along without feeling like it's dragging out. The historical accuracy of the time period is excellent. And the actors are wonderfully cast."
Chosen,Emotional. Magic.,"I was dubious about watching this due to Super Church Evangelical American involvement. Then I watched the first few minutes of episode 1. Wow. As a Roman Catholic, I have to say that this is about watching something that brings outrageous joy. I admire the chap behind it. Different denominations but the same God who must be thrilled with this. Magic. Spiritual. Brilliant. Love it."
Chosen,Probably the best in Christian entertainment,"I was very impressed by what this team of filmmakers could do with so little. I like that they can do what they want with the show, but I hope they continue to get more professional people involved in the show. Bottom line... buy the Blu-Ray, pay-it-forward, do what you can to support it.

Why did I give it a 7/10? Because frankly, I think a 9.8 and 100% is a bit much... not many professional Hollywood movies or shows deserves it. Now if we're talking just in Christian media in general... yeah, this deserves a 9.8! The writing is very good, amazing sets, and believable acting! My only qualms are occasional added dialogue or events, but there's nothing heretical about the series by any means. I'm also glad they got New Testament scholars to approve the script as well!

Again, I can't stress enough, support the show!"
Chosen,3k + are going to hate me.,"I know... Let's add this review to my list of sins.

To be fare it's not a review but an opinion.

I was bored beyond i imagine during the first chapter. The whole, Holy Land theme park set me off... Even in the real theme park.

Everything looks so fake, the costumes are not clothes, they are costumes and i doubt anything was as clean as it's shown in the series.

The dialogues are bland and unengaging. So if this was my feeling during the first episode why would I keep watching?. As a believer, just because it's about Jesus?. No... It's slow paced and boring.

Anyways, we know already how it's going to end.

Right?."
Chosen,"An unreal, but extremely real show about the hope of mankind","Can't even watch this without being emotionally wrecked, moved, inspired in so many ways. This is it and it is amazingly produced. All you want is more. More, more, MORE.

To see this so well done and visually depicted. It's a must watch. Binge watch. You have to watch, experience, and tell others."
Chosen,Breathtaking!,I have seen the first four episodes! They are amazing! If you think the Bible is hard to follow this will help you understand it to depths I never imagined! Great work to everyone involved and I am honored to be a part of such an amazing blessing to all!
Chosen,Epic!,"I usually hate Christian movies and show! They're so cheesy and boring. But this was amazing and honestly help my relationship with Jesus. It made him come ive a bit, gave him a personality and sense of humor. Yet was still biblical and not overhyped or too Hollywood.

Please watch this and also check out the chosen website to see how you can support them so they can make more seasons."
Chosen,"Truly I Say To You, Amazing!","This is one of the most powerful experiences I have ever had in my life! What an exceptional depiction of every one of the apostles (given Matthew maybe, a little too quirky) and of our Christ as a human. Wow! Highly recommended. Nicodemus is a great character and this ALL seems so real and so very human. Great!"
Chosen,Best Portral of Jesus Ever!,"The sets, costumes, acting, and emotional responses in this series are far and above any I have ever seen in the past. Watching the episodes over and over does not in any way deter the depth of emotions both shown on screen and felt by the viewer. Jesus is portrayed as authentic, relatable, humorous, kind and patient. The series brings Him to life in a wonderful way--both as human and God."
Chosen,Excellent!!!,Most accurate and moving depiction of any true story I've ever seen! The acting is so superb I find myself emotionally exhausted after each viewing. I can not get enough of this. I am so excited for the next episodes to be released!
Chosen,It is life!,"You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll want a hug from Jesus when it's all said and done!! It touched me to my core and Jesus is more alive, than ever before!!💪🙏💜"
Chosen,Surprisingly good!,"This show has really surprised me. I did not expect the production value, the directing, the acting, the writing, the music to be this good considering the show can be watched for free (You can download the app of the Android and iOS App Store).

This is the first portrayal of Christ and his followers that I really liked (of the ones that I have watched) and you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy it. It is just very well made and entertaining and engaging. Jonathan Roumie's portrayal of Jesus Christ is the best and most human portrayal of Jesus I have seen to date. My favourite character has to be Nicodemus portrayed by Erick Avari. His character development over the first 8 episodes is very well done and his inner struggle at the end of Season 1 is very relatable.

All in all I got much more invested into the show than I thought I would. It's one of the best shows I have seen in the last couple of years and I think it deserves a lot more attention. I am looking forward to Season 2."
Chosen,"I Want So Bad for This to be Good, but the Show Needs Work","When I first saw the pilot episode for this show, I was impressed by by the cinematography and story line. I was really hopeful that finally some Christians could make a quality film about Jesus' life, and so I invested in the project. So far I will say some episodes have been better than others, especially where they build up the plot and back story of the characters to enhance the Gospel story line (that is to do justice to the Gospel story line). However, in many episodes the plot tends to run really slow and just drags out unnecessarily.

From a script writing perspective, there's often no conflict, no climax, no plot hangers- just people walking around talking about how great Jesus' sermon was, and characters having small chit chat, etc (Season 3, Ep. 1). The writers really need to work on the script.

While I know no film will ever do true justice to Jesus' character, I wish they could try to make Jesus' words a little less cliche at times and more in the spirit of who he was. One of the most amazing things about Jesus is that he never wasted words- he always had the perfect answer in the moment and most often answered tough questions with another witty or more profound question. The hardest questions of life, after all, can't be answered with trite cliches or simple explanations (read Job). Sometimes in the show, the Jesus character comes across as too simple and cliche in this regard.

From a Biblical perspective, I will say I'm thankful they're being faithful to the spirit and essence of the Biblical message. However, even this could be improved. They often try to embellish the plot and dialogue so much in their own way without using Scripture (that ultimately turns out boring), and leave out a lot of opportunities for deep Scriptural moments. Ideally, I would suggest interweaving Scripture/ quotes of Jesus throughout the episodes and build up the plot so as to bring more color and context to Jesus' words in Scripture. After all, if you want to make the films powerful, put in more Scripture- because this is the most powerfully moving script you could ever come up with.

The biggest problem is, most people barely scratch the surface of Scripture, fail to unpack the context, allusions, symbolism, imagery and foreshadowing that's in the Bible. Seriously, the Bible is the deepest, most exciting book you could ever read, but so few people see it because they barely even look. Hollywood filmmakers doing Biblical movies totally screw up the story because they're clueless to the beauty and richness of the Bible. Most Christian filmmakers, while they understand the heart of the Gospel, often come from a cheesy, superficial church background (i.e. Mainstream American Christianity), and so also fail to bring out the deep gems of Scripture in their films. What ideally needs to happen is to get some Biblical scholars together with creative film makers to make something great.

One example of a Biblical film doing this excellently is the ""The Passion of the Christ""- especially in the scene where Jesus crushes the snake's head in the garden of Gethsemane. They do an excellent job of subtly bringing out the Biblical imagery here of Christ: Adam round 2, in a garden again, but this time not yielding to the serpent's temptations. Instead he obeys the Father's will, crushes the serpent's head, undoing his work and fulfilling the Genesis 3 prophecy. Seriously, film has such amazing potential to bring out the gems in Scripture and the riches of the Bible, but so few people know how to do it because they either don't see the gems or they don't know how to make good film.

There was a period in history when Christian art was the best art in the world- think Bach, Handel, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, etc. Unfortunately, in our modern era Christian art, music and writing tends to be superficial, cliche and below par compared to the world's art. Unfortunately I think that stems from a superficial theology that's often taught in mainstream American churches. Ultimately, a superficial understanding of God produces superficial expressions of art. Nevertheless, there are examples of Christians still producing excellent art in our era of time (I would put Tolkien and C. S. Lewis up there), and I hope as a church we can keep getting better and better, and hopefully do better justice to the reality of God's beauty through our art."
Chosen,provocative,"I saw it as a challenge to viewer, actors. Because it is different and , after the first reserves, it works very well. It is the Story but told in different manner, with high simplicity and profound honesty. Yes, it is the story who you know but the performances and the director vision give new perspectives. No doubts, it is not a serie to impress. But to propose a basic way to discover what you know to know. So, provocative can be a reasonable term. Like adventure, too, if you do not ignore than this trip involves so precise delicacy."

A Man Returned,Christian Filmmakers Take Notice: THIS Is How You Do It,"I'm honestly really impressed by what the makers of this show have accomplished. It's such a unique take that they've given to the story, this sort of ""street-level view"" of those people that encountered Jesus. Reading these stories in the Bible again and again makes it easy to become detached from the fact that these were real people living real lives dealing with real struggles, going to work, hanging with friends, making jokes, eating lunch, and stepping in animal poop 😂 but they've brought it all to life in an engaging and relatable way where the tight budget seldom shows.

I love that this show doesn't feel preachy, like most Christian media. The way the camera kind of bobs and sways as it follows the action lends an almost documentarian vibe that makes me feel like I'm simply witnessing a story unfold. No agenda. No sermon. Just good old fashioned storytelling. Of course, we know that there is a very profound message to it all, but the filmmakers are smart enough to let the audience figure it out for themselves without thumping them over the head with ""Christian talk.""

The actor portraying Jesus does so with an unflinching kindness and empathy that makes him instantly trustworthy and lovable in every. single. scene. So props to him for his amazing work and props to the casting team for finding him!

This is a great show that, even if not suited to everyone's tastes, is bound to challenge our mental perception of these people and their stories. It makes these characters feel real, brings Jesus to life in a new way, and has some fun with artistic license while still honoring God's Word.

Christian filmmakers take note: THIS is how you do it!"
A Man Returned,Fantastic series with a fresh perspective!,Love how human the Chosen are! Totally relatable in today's world and they could have been any one of us. Thank you for this wonderful peek into history. A devoted fan forever! #bingeJesus
A Man Returned,A believable Jesus,"Following the progress of this idea from dream to reality, I was excited to have access to the first four episodes. This series is unlike any Biblical portrayal of the life of Christ to date - the characters are fresh and real- check out Abigail!! And a Jesus who winks! And doesn't glow or act ethereal! These first four episodes bring the Gospels to life in a way that immerses us into a culture and recounting that feels authentic. Kudos to everyone involved- I can't wait for more."
A Man Returned,The Best On-Screen Depiction of the Life Christ; Deeply Moving and Relatable,"Christian movies and shows aren't typically known for quality, good character development, or well-written, compelling stories. There are certainly some exceptions (e.g., The Passion of the Christ, I Can Only Imagine, Ben-Hur, I'm Not Ashamed, Faith Like Potatoes, The Case for Christ, and Narnia).

To cut straight to the point: The Chosen is far and away the best on-screen depiction of the life of Christ-either mini-series or movie. The writing and character development are exceptional. It's as captivating as The Passion, yet in so many ways more human and relatable. My family and I keep re-watching them just to get one more glimpse of the Son of Man. The miracles are deeply moving and will bring you to tears.

And now... the biggest problem is we'll have to wait for Season 2. The wait is going to hurt more than waiting for Stranger Things Season 3."
A Man Returned,An unexpected Treasure,"My wife wanted me to watch The Chosen with her, and I avoided it for weeks, because I expected yet another well-intentioned but 'cheesy' Christian production. Then I finally gave in. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. This production is amazing! The quality of the scripts, acting, and sets are all on a par with the production values of a well-regarded Hollywood 'short season' series. And the depiction of the historical culture and the conjectural backstories for key figures around Jesus are BETTER than anything I have seen elsewhere. If you are at all curious about a fresh take on the life of Jesus that still maintains rigorous effort to remain true to the New Testament record, I would HIGHLY recommend this series!"

Merlí. Sapere Aude,Breath of Fresh Air,"< Merlí: Sapere Aude > The series I didn't know I needed till I watched it.

Tired of American attitude, accent and acquisition, British make believe and bluster I clicked on the Spanish - Catalan ""Merlí: Sapere Aude"" currently showing on Netflix Boy am I glad I did!

We are thrown into the lives of a group of young Spanish, Argentian, French, American students freshly enrolled in a university in Barcelona and their pungent, unforgettable tutors and family.

Parachuting into philosophy and metaphysics, the series somehow NEVER bores, never turns hysterical and always finds a new emotional twist and turn even as it proffers eye candy, heartbreak, coming of age, humour and some magnificent classroom teaching... I am reminded of my time in uni and am made both young and wiser What a pleasure, what a serendipitous gift in the midst of Netflix sameism.

It lures you in, reinvents a tough time, presents an attractive, cleaned up (it is TV yet) version, modern, young, culturally different - an alternative, human and inspiring parallel world.

This alone is worth the 'click' to view both 8 episode seasons.

Carlos Cuevas as Pol Rubio is the centrepiece of this quiet storm, physically perfect with the devilish eyes of a Leonardo Salai and intellect and raw emotion to break your heart.

Maria Pujalte as philosophy professor Maria Bolano is so convincing I want to meet her and attend her classes and laugh, yes laugh along with her acerbic defiance.

I'm glad I'm old enough, young enough to enjoy this.

I'm watching it again as I write this .. Must watch - 2 Thumbs Up 👍👍"
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Witty and sexy,"I have not seen Merlí, but have no problem getting into this sequel. This is partly due to the really good actors, and partly, of course, to the story, which I was a little skeptical about at first, because lately I find too many Spanish series with pretty boys and naked butts on Netflix. However, that's really only an accessory here, because this series doesn't want to be a telenevola with hot Latinos. The title says it all, dare to be wise - we are dealing with philosophy, or rather with students who study philosophy at the university in Barcelona and struggle with various lecturers, good or bad grades and of course the obligatory love affairs. You quickly realize that Barcelona has more to offer than a few beautiful neighborhoods, and those who want to can work through ethical and philosophical questions, sometimes humorously. A really successful mixture."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,"Loved it! Sexy, funny and interesting.","This show came up on my Netflix recommendations and I'm glad I gave it a chance. Interesting, different, funny and sexy. You will fall in love with Barcelona and Carlos Cuevas character Pol. Although is a spinoff you don't have to watch the original show to enjoy it but after I watched the original, some things made more sense, especially in the beginning. The first season has some filler characters and storylines that felt unnecessary but they were gone by season 2. So the story focuses more on Pol and that makes the final season better. Overall a very enjoyable show with some clever writing and quirky characters."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Homage to a drama from Cataluña,"What a beautiful series this has been. I hadn't realised it was a follow-up to an earlier drama, so I shall be searching out the original now. But as for this, I found it to be utterly beguiling. Every character was so believable, with all the frailties and vulnerabilities of youth, but with marvellous performances from 'older' cast members too. It felt effortlessly authentic, a testament to the level of acting, direction and production of all involved. Beautiful and so moving."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Fantastic sequel to the greatest series of all time!,"Absolutely loved it...maybe not as much as the original series...but quite good. Focuses on Pol Rubio as he starts his university studies in philosophy. Most action involves the colleagues that Pol meets at the ""Uni"" (Mineva, Rai, Biel, Oti, Amy, Etienne...) and some of the story involves Bruno Bergeron. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"

Merlí. Sapere Aude,Outstanding... especially season 2.,"Having watched season one and enjoyed it, I felt season 2 would be similar. But this is actually outstanding this season. The acting, the storyline, the emotions, several episodes in this season have been incredible. The soundtrack too is very special and especially the closing piece to this episode.

Congratulations to the writers, directors produces etc for telling this emotional story and thanks to Carlos Cuevas for taking this on. One can't quite believe when you enter episode 2 what to expect but its handled with real honesty and beauty. Now one of my favourite all time shows I will recommend on so many levels."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Solid Performances reflecting college life at an international university,"This is a 20's something show about life, school, sex, and relationships. While purported to be freshmen, it is clear that many of the 1st year students are likely in their early 20s, some still living at home, others near campus.

The dynamics is centered around love, life, and arousal of a group of philosophy majors. The premise makes for an interesting and broad story as attitudes adjust through the awareness of what they learn. In this youth oriented era, sexuality is loosely defined, breaking down strict barriers between gay and straight. While their are some characters are fall definitely into these roles, the main cast finds the convenience of sex with whomever is closer at the moment of passion, regardless of gender.

The adults play a smaller yet significant role as they deal with the realities of life. As with all people, sometimes the responses are mature and at other times impulsive or conform to long held beliefs. To that end, seeing them as imperfect creates authenticity.

As an American, I do enjoy the European view of Trump, guns, and violence. We so often look at other nations as being dangerous, wreak less, and cesspool of crime, yet ignore the very same, if not larger issues here at home. It is good to look at ourselves through the eyes of others. There is much to learn from the few lines of dialog that addresses Spain's view of the US.

It is interesting that while American TV has all but abolished smoking; as there are proven studies that it has a direct influence on use and acceptance, in Europe it capture as part of the realism of society. I won't deny that I would prefer a smoke-free environment but I am mindful that I am guest invited to watch a show produced outside of my sterile world.

My only complaint with the show is a relatively small scene in the 5th episode. As one of the characters walks through a gay bar, it is seedy, dim, sex is occurring against every bare wall, and drug use is rampant. For a show that tears down stereotypes and provides a refreshing view of human sexuality, that scene fell upon every trope about gay people and what many conservatives believe happens. It was an insult to the LGBT community and I hope the showrunners learn from the error of their ways.

Sans the stumble in episode 5, it is a compelling drama of young people finding their way in life. The fact that many struggle financially also brings greater realism to the characters...a point often missed in US shows. A solid show with much to offer those willing to open their minds and take a meandering but thought provoking ride through the lives of our next generation."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Exceptional,"Merli is one of the better LGBTQ series. Wonderful cast of characters and well directed. The philosophical scenes were inspired and the Bolena actress did an excellent job. Occasionally the subtitles seemed to make the dialogue a bit puzzling, sort of jumping the track. The music was amazingly fitting. Would like to know where I might obtain the second season."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,"Good series, but what happened to Bruno???",Comentario no disponible
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Brilliant!,"An exceptionally well written, acted, and directed series. A group of first year philosophy students come to terms with both student life and their own sexual identities as the series develops. It manages to get over some very complex philosophical concepts with relative ease, relating them to the thoughts and actions of the characters, demonstrating that philosophy has practical applications and is not all esoteric. The characters are well developed over the course of the two series, dealing with the inequalities of existence, the hard knocks of life, as well as the highs. The sex scenes were convincingly erotic. Carlos Cuevas does a brilliant job as the lead."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Unfinished Business,Comentario no disponible
Merlí. Sapere Aude,It fails to connect in many ways,"Merlí was simply one of the greatest series ever made. Besides the grandiosity of Merlí, the rest of the cast was outstanding, and the script made them flow naturally between each other. The story was believable, emotional, deep and it's all about character development.

Merlí. Sapere Aude fails in all this. It seems to be a gathering of non-believable characters put together to spin around Paul. It just doesn't connect with anything. None of the characters connect the viewer.

Where is the connection to Merlí? The series is set 3 weeks after the Merlí story ends, and it's like that universe ceased to exist. Besides from Bruno and Calduch, which make shallow appearances. Where is Tania? Where is Bruno's sister? Where is Ivan? These people can't just disappear from one day to the next, specially when the story's main character had such strong connections with them.

The script fails to achieve a new story and tries too much to separate itself from Merlí. It just doesn't work. It's disappointing to see how the same script writer can make something so beautiful as Merlí and fall down into something that no depth at all.

I'd much rather see a Merlí Prequel than a Paul sequel written like this."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Epic series,"Is one of the best series I have ever watched, collected really great actresses and actors. Very diverse, clever made and brilliant stories of their lives. Must watch!"
Merlí. Sapere Aude,So enchanting,"When characters develop like beautiful flowers right before your eyes you know you have both a great script & director. Everyone in this great story, flaws & all, are mesmerizing. The acting is flawless. You find yourself really caring about their lives & outcomes. One of my favorite finds on Netflix. The story centers on Pol & Bruno from the earlier story of Merlí. Pol is in university trying to find his feet & at a loss because of Merlí's passing. Pol & Bruno commiserate over Merlí & remain friends although Bruno is still in love with Pol. The characters are beautifully developed & continue to grow under the tuteledge of their pholosophy professor played by the marvelous Maria Pujalte with a stand out performance."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,One of the best series I've ever binge-watched.,"I almost stopped watching this series after the first episode, but I am so glad I didn't. I was badly in need of a distraction in my life, so I binge-watched the first 11 episodes and they grew ever more intriguing. Characters develop and change. Complications are resolved and new characters are introduced. This diverse and quirky group of friends united by true affection for each other both create and help each other through problems while pondering philosophical problems that may be above the heads of or below the interest thresholds of some viewers, but somehow they add to the mix, as do the problems and clashes being experienced by their instructors, administrators and parents. Not for the prudish, but the more graphic scenes are not without purpose. Well-written. Well-acted. Definitely for adults."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Perfect Philosophy,"An amazing story, fabulous cast, very successful direction and excellent acting. I am very surprised about the high quality of all players' performances. There was no average. As if all of them were real.

As for story, all the elements of the story, life, love, philosophy, jealousy, betrayal, humilation, being rich, being poor, dreams, passion, family, friendship were perfectly balanced in the course of the story. It is a warm series. I mean there is human warm and touch at your soul. And songs, all of them were beautiful. I loved this TV series and thank you for all who gifted it to us. You did well-done job!"
Merlí. Sapere Aude,What a huge disappointment,Comentario no disponible
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Script alternates between boring philosophical discussions and Sex!,"Merli was a good series. It had substance. This sequel lacks that substance and depth. It's more of a cross between ""L'Auberge Francaise"" and ""Elite"". The script simply alternates boring philosophical discussions, a few anti-American digs, and sex of all varieties. So, not a winner at all!

Season 2: This continues in the same vein as Season 1, but deals with a particular illness for which Barcelona serves as the epicenter in Spain. The characters do not seem to have become more mature, and the pattern of inserting scenes which have little relevance to the main story, continues. The same boring philosophical discussions continue, adding little to the series. It's interesting to see how university education there appears to be very flexible with students being able to drop in and out of classes as it suits them."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Disappointing and totally illogical.,"Merlí was an amazing series, with a central character and a solid main storyline, but what made it special was the variety of interesting characters and well-developed, diverse stories around them. In the follow-up, they failed to recreate that natural dynamic between philosophy and teenage issues. Everything felt forced.

Moreover, setting the series just three weeks after Merlí's death and making almost all the characters disappear is absurd. Those who remained didn't act logically based on what we had previously seen.

Another thing I didn't like is how they turned a series with deep developments and stories into one focused on teenage LGBT romances, with superficial characters that seem added without purpose. Some characters felt glued to the story, not contributing anything interesting. At times, it felt more like Elite than a worthy continuation of Merlí."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,spectare non aude...,"Merli is a great series and Carlos Cueva, who acted kind of second lead next to Merli, deserved a spin off for his great performance.

Unfortunately this spin off is quite bad.

While Merli was about philosophy, psychology daily life troubles and full of great actings, Sapere Aude (by the way a ridiculous and boastful title for a series that has nothing to know or think about) has nothing of it, but only shows the homosexual relations of Pol.

With the exception of the alcoholic university teacher there is mostly nothing else happening around, all the side characters are shallow, not developed and spin in an unbelievable way around the too main character Pol. It's disappointing to see how the same script writer can make something so beautiful as Merlí and fall down into something that has no depth at all but is only about a lot of male nude butts.

As almost nothing happend and some actings are quite painfull (so the contraty of the original season were everything and everybody worked together in a round and believable way) I didnt watch season 2."
Merlí. Sapere Aude,Too superficial,"I recently watched heartstopper. I have to say that even the main characters are school students, the series is much more mature and targeted to adults than this one. The superficiality of the main characters combined with the Spanish culture is just something I can not relate to at all. I was once a college student, but still why can I not relate?... Nevermind."

Giri/Haji,Great drama dressed up as cops n robbers,"Wonderful to be introduced to such a tremendous cast. Loved Will Sharpe who made Rodney a standout but equally compelling were Takehiro Hira, Yosuke Kubozuka and Aoi Okuyama. Great to see new people on screen. It's not often I can see the perfection of direction but everything about this show was superb. Hays off to Julian Farino. I'll be watching him. Stellar."
Giri/Haji,Unusual Drama - It's Good!,Comentario no disponible
Giri/Haji,Just Perfect!,"I rarely feel strong enough about a film or series to write a review, however this show was so perfect I just had to rate it. The acting, the direction, the production, the music, the script, everything was perfect. I was gripped from the beginning and each episode didn't disappoint. There were so many great, subtle touches too and innovative camerawork. Almost impossible to pick out any single actor, they were all excellent but Will Sharpe was incredible. I genuinely can't ever think I'll watch a better show...."
Giri/Haji,Solid 10,"What a breath of fresh air in a world where tv is so uniform and unoriginal that you can predict the next move a mile away.

I'm also grateful that we got to discover a bit of Japan and its culture beyond the usual Hollywood cliches.

Well worth my time and highly recommended."
Giri/Haji,Much more than a detective/crime/gangster series,"Binged watched this week but no spoilers here. This really benefits from having 8 episodes rather than the BBC's usual 6 and allows for greater character development and backstories. There are side plots and stories galore, bloody violence, humour, tears, sadness & retribution but everything comes together with a few twists and turns in a final episode that has one of the most unexpected & touching rooftop moments. The cast are fantastic as is the script and cinematography. Loved it."
Giri/Haji,"Another brilliant international show got cancelled after one season, why?!","Unbelievable! This is a perfect fusion of Asien ( Japanese) and European (British) cinema with an intelligent script, great animation parts, complex character development and outstanding actors! If you want to criticize something, there could be less brutality, but on the other hand it's a crime drama about the Yakuza. So it fits again.

How come this show has a rating below 8 stars and small-minded shows with their predictable, repetetive stories and stereotypical good guy- bad guy characters like Cobra Kay already have 3 seasons and are rated with over 8,5?! I just don't get it."
Giri/Haji,EXCEPTIONAL,"Exceptional storytelling and direction in this compelling series which broke the mold and reinvented the genre with its brave and brilliant style, Everything about it was outstanding - directing, writing, casting. It had humor and wit despite the bleak subject matter and it was all done with incredible style. British drama showing the world how its done."
Giri/Haji,Great Until...,Comentario no disponible
Giri/Haji,"Quality drama, the like of which has not seen for a a while.","Giri/Haji is truly an incredible eight part drama, it is virtually flawless.

Part one is pretty heavy going, you need to concentrate because you are placed in the middle of a scenario without most of the answers that you need, we it unfolds you will learn all you need to, and be able to put the pieces together.

Part four is the high point, a better individual episode of a drama I cannot think of, it is absolutely incredible, if you're not captivated by this show at this point, you will be from here on in.

The cinematography and production values are off the scale, I doubt a more visually amazing masterpiece has ever been made. To dwell solely on its appearance is unfair, the content and story will have you enthralled.

The acting is pretty much perfect throughout, you can't pinpoint one or even three people as standing out, everyone does. Everyone gets their moment.

It's incredible, 10/10."
Giri/Haji,"Good, but not great, drama","The nephew of a powerful Yakuza boss is murdered in London. The Tokyo Police suspect that the perpetrator is a former member of a rival Yakuza clan. After a counter-hit on his former clan and fearing an escalating gang war, the suspect's brother, a police detective, is sent to London to track him down and bring him back to Japan.

Good drama series but promised to be brilliant. Started very well: the first four episodes were fantastic, full of action, an interesting plot, good back stories and interesting characters. However, the longer it went on the more implausible and contrived some of the plot development became. Some developments are quite farcical.

Furthermore, writer-creator Joe Barton tries to cram in far too many sub-plots into the series. I was only really interested in the crime-drama aspect but Barton has all sorts of other angles wound around this, stories that really don't add anything. I didn't mind when they were just there to provide some colour to proceedings but instead of staying as minor filler they become major plot streams (in terms of time consumed, rather than quality or interest/entertainment factor). Episodes 5-8 become very unfocused because of this, resulting in my interest and engagement waning.

It all comes together more-or-less okay in the end but the contrast with how it started is still quite stark.

A tighter plot, captured in about 4 or 5 episodes instead of 8, and this would have been excellent."
Giri/Haji,Outstanding,"Acting , cast, story line, drama, action , humour, visual effects ........... (Could go on and on) outstanding. British drama at its best. 10/10 all day long."

Giri/Haji,Starts strong and immediately turns to hot garbage,Comentario no disponible
Giri/Haji,Must See. Really!,"After watching one-and-a-half episodes of the execrable series ""The Witcher,"" I'd begun to doubt the reliability of IMDB ratings. Then, I decided to try ""Giri/Haji,"" suspicious of its 7.9 rating. Also, I'd seen Joe Barton's series ""Cuffs,"" and while enjoyable, it was pretty weak beer.

""Giri/Haji"" was an absolute revelation, right from the start through the eighth and final episode. The writing and direction, art direction, cinematography and effects, were just superb. And the acting! I was not familiar with any of the Japanese actors, but they were great. So were the British actors, many of them familiar to fans of UK films and TV, including Kelly Macdonald (first seen in Trainspotting), Charlie Creed-Miles (from Peaky Blinders), Tony Way (from Ricky Gervais' ""After Life""), and new-to-me Will Sharpe.

Part family drama, part police procedural, part Yakuza film, the movie flips between London and Tokyo during a Japanese gang war. Strange as it may seem, the various filmic elements hold together beautifully, whether changes in screen dimension to denote time shifts; brief uses of anime; and a lovely ballet sequence.

It is bloody, violent, tender, exciting, and contemplative. Something for everyone. I fully recommend this series."
Giri/Haji,Will watch it again,"The first episode starts with the kind of stylized art violence that is unreal enough to let me carry on watching. Resonates with ""the matrix"" (gun scene) or similar.

The daughter, Taki, is so beautiful, that presumably the stage direction in her shots is: ""Close up of Taki's face, takes half the screen, dialogue (optional), something else pertinent to the plot and artfully arranged in the other half of the shot, pause on Taki's face for 8 seconds, cut. Repeat"".

Sometimes it suffers a bit from acting as if some characters are ""wise"" or might suddenly say ""the answer"" (to life and everything I suppose) - a lot of things ""happen"", and then the characters are generally busy seeking meaning, and we happen to be there, so we are along for the ride. But they are as muddled as anyone in the world, more so maybe. If you stop looking for meaning, just fall in love with the characters, and appreciate the series of heists, showdowns, coincidences and cinematography, it is more enjoyable, and watchable.

For me, the brother Yuto is a bit irritating to watch in episode 1 - maybe because he has so many ""soft focus"" ""in the past"" scenes, which make him look and act like a model for photos that come free/ready installed in new photo frames than a real person. The other characters are all engaging, and only he is the odd man out in this episode. Also, this is the odd-episode-out too - yuto improves.

There is some unevenness in what is possible/impossible in this created universe, especially around fight scenes and show downs - sometimes the characters are unbeatable/unstoppable in their gunfighting skills, callous professional heisting and doing the job of the gangster/police/yakuza. Other times, ""those pesky kids"" (not those pesky kids, but some of the non-yakuza characters) seem to be able to get the upper hand over the gansters by hitting with a frypan or a pair of scissors, against automatic weapons and uneven numbers, and get away with it. That breaks the magic really. But at least there is a lot of magic:

The series has its own style and its own humour. The between-the-scenes boards and narator are cool/witty/self deprecating. In terms of characters, Rodney and the Cockney gangster could each have a show of thier own really, their dialogue is so sharp and watchable.

And even apart from those two shining stars, there is quirkiness and humour in this show, that means I feel I can watch it again. Look out for hidden personal messages to some of the characters in the billboard/adverts and airport departure boards, and even painted onto the road where the ""Stop/go slow"" should be.

Stop, go slow, and watch it again."
Giri/Haji,Superb!,"This is simply one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Head spinningly original story telling backed up by brilliant direction and fantastic performances by all concerned, with a special mention for Will Sharpe who plays Rodney.

Brutal violence, complicated family dynamics, a love story - it has all these elements and so much more, including moments of highly amusing black comedy.

I would still like to know more about the snake and the nappy scene will live long in the memory.

A huge thank you to all concerned for making such a high quality, totally addictive and unmissable drama."
Giri/Haji,Truly extraordinary and impossible to adequately describe,"I will watch this compelling and complex series again. The story telling, character development, different cultures represented (Japanese, British) and stylized presentation are riveting. The overt plot includes two brothers, one a detective, the other a member of the yakuza; it the title, Duty/Shame belies a much deeper psychological portrayal of love, betrayal, acceptance, grief. Truly, a unique viewing experience. I would say that in watching this, stay with it. The story is many layered and unfolds slowly. The acting is exceptional throughout."
Giri/Haji,"Starts out OK,","Good start,,,along the way things unravel. Situations become less credible. It's one of those series that probably should have been cut in half. There are about 50% good scenes and the rest feels like filler."
Giri/Haji,Watch 1st three episodes,"This started of really well. First 2 episodes were mind-blowing and refreshing. The animation part was awesome ,flashbacks were done great too. But after 4th episode it just became something else. Lost all its charm due to unnecessary subplots."
Giri/Haji,"Well developed characters and acting, but unnecessarily too long","First few episodes were interesting, however, after the fifth one, it was just a drudge to watch with a stagnant plot. Ending was disappointing as well but still giving it a 6."
Giri/Haji,Wow,"This I stumbled upon and what a find. Great characters, writing, storyline and enough action added to the series that makes it hard to not watch. Very good binge worthy show."
Giri/Haji,Poor screenplay with a lot of loose ends,"Poor screenplay with a lot of loose ends , and that's a shame because the actores are good and deserves more"
Giri/Haji,Mixed bag,"I'm on the next to last episode, the show went from a great Noir episode 1, to fair and by episode 7 idiotic soap opera garbage. The so called good guys are more loathsome than the Yakuza and the Kelly McDonald's characters actions make no sense."
Giri/Haji,"Well cast, clever and funny","I binge watched this compulsive series. Loved it. Clever filming, interesting with everything in the mix. Some hide behind the cushion violence, candid sexual content and the most brilliant cast."
Giri/Haji,Feels like a normal crime mystery until a irrelevant dance,"It seemed like one of the very well-done gangster crime investigation series initially. With great acting, a lot of primary and secondary characters and stories. Intriguing, very well paced and a storyline which keeps you wanting to know what's next.

But I personally felt the nonchalant dance sequence which occurs randomly in a later episode was just too freaking good. That short sequence where we're shown which all of the characters are connected on a primary level, and thenon a secondary level...and after that the interconnected characters was something I've never seen ever before.

The dance by itself is not an elaborate setup or anything. It's a simple aerial view of characters moving and connecting. But brings a perspective of the show like a recap of sorts. And I absolutely loved it.

When binging on Netflix, where ""previously"" is skipped...and on weekly shows where we wish ""previously on"" can be skipped, this was so refreshingly new and did it without showing a single earlier episode image even.

And this sequence which I never expected from a Korean/Brit series just caught me off guard. The overall story and acting by characters are great too and needs a watch."

Ash vs Evil Dead,Ended too soon,"Ash Vs. Evil Dead was such a pleasant surprise. It takes place thirty years after the movies. It follows Ash Williams as he continues to be mankind's only hope to fight evil. It stars Bruce Campbell in a career performance and a very solid supporting cast led by Ray Santiago, Dana DeLorenzo, Lucy Lawless and Arielle Carver-O'Neil. This show is not like most horror shows, it's more of a comedy. It's absolutely bananas but in a good way, it knows exactly what kind of show it wants to be and never strays. It had such a cult following when it was on and has a 8.4 rating so people seemed to really like it so the only thing I'm disappointed about is that it only lasted 3 seasons."
Ash vs Evil Dead,I'm Glad i'd watched this.,Thank you Bruce for a bunch of great.... awesome moments. This show rocks.
Ash vs Evil Dead,How stupid you have to be to cancel this show?,"Let's see. What was the problem? 8.5 on IMDB? Lot of episodes above 9? Solid fanbase? Millions of viewers around the globe? This show was getting better and better... And Grey's Anatomy is continued for the 15th season. What is wrong with the world? How many demons GA has? Exactly zero? How many ripped off heads? Also zero? And how many chainsaws? Yep, 0. Ok, it has fake blood, but still Ash wins by miles there, too. This show is great, it is a solid 9 and that is rare. Let's hope that a network, with white collars' IQ above 60, will buy the franchise and continue till the cows come home."
Ash vs Evil Dead,Who is the idiot that cancelled this glorious series!?,"I mean what is not to like about this show? Hilarious, Gruesome, Scary, oh did I mention hilarious!! Acting is phenomenal and the writing is perfect. Not sure what the standards are these days of canceling shows but who ever made this decision is an idiot"
Ash vs Evil Dead,Bring it back. Hail to the king baby.,Bruce Campbell can't end it like that we gotta have a season 4 and many more. Same with the movies. There ain't no killing deadites like ash does.
Ash vs Evil Dead,"Fantastic show for fans of the original Evil Dead trilogy and newcomers alike: the perfect mix of laughs, scares and gore","Well, we've had to be patient for nearly a quarter of a century to finally see Ash wield his chainsaw again, but trust me: it was well worth the wait. Ash vs. Evil Dead fires on all cylinders.

After so many years had passed since Army of Darkness (aka Evil Dead III) came out in 1992, it looked like a direct sequel just wasn't going to happen anymore, yet apparently, the Raimi-Campbell gang had been working on one for some time. According to recent interviews with the show's creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, what was first supposed to be a new feature film and the fourth entry in the franchise, over time turned into an idea for a TV-series, and I believe fans will be very happy with the result. Instead of a 2-hour film for a sequel, we now get 5 more hours with Ash and the Deadites (possibly more if the show's going to be a success) and judging from what I've seen so far, those 5 hours are going to be an absolute blast.

(This paragraph contains some – very – mild spoilers; there won't be any in the rest of this review). At the beginning of the show we meet Ash leading a lazy, but apparently happy slacker life, residing in a run-down trailer and working as a stock boy at a Value Stop (for some obscure legal reasons, the writers couldn't use the name S-Mart from Army of Darkness' iconic last scene). In the show, 30 years have passed since Ash's last encounter with the Deadites, and while he might be well into middle age now, he hasn't matured one bit. Ash is still the exact same guy we last saw fighting walking skeletons and other ghastly undead things in Army of Darkness, cracking wise and appearing as cock-sure of himself as ever (despite still not being the ""smartest cookie in the jar"" - to put it mildly). These days, he likes to spend most of his spare time either getting wasted in his trailer or picking up random ladies - or both (mostly both). I won't go further into any of the story details (because that would only spoil the fun); suffice to say that his rather irresponsible lifestyle ultimately won't go too well with his duty as keeper of a certain (slightly) dangerous book, and (very!) bloody mayhem soon ensues.

In my opinion, Ash vs. Evil Dead does everything right. Instead of going down the ""gritty drama"" route of shows like The Walking Dead or taking the ""straight horror"" approach of Fede Alvarez' Evil Dead remake, creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fully embrace the over-the-top goofiness and playful tone of Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, while still delivering the scares of the first film and plenty (and I mean: PLENTY) of gore. The Deadites are frightening, but they're also kind of comical in that they don't look too realistic (don't get me wrong, their make-up is gorgeous, but they don't look like the zombies from George A. Romero's films or The Walking Dead). The production values in general are absolutely great; the writing is in the vein of the first three films (no wonder, since the episodes were mostly written by Sam and Ivan Raimi); the music, the pacing and the direction: really everything just falls into place. It's clear that this wasn't some lazy attempt to cash in on the name of a beloved cult-franchise, but a labour of love for all involved.

Another great plus of the series is the cast. Seeing Bruce Campbell step back into this iconic character is simply hilarious fun; it still fits him like a glove (or, perhaps more accurately in his case, a chainsaw). But there was never a doubt in my mind that he would deliver (it seems Ash is a character Campbell was born to play); what really surprised me was how well the rest of the cast fits into the show. Ray Santiago as Pablo and Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly (they're Ash's co-workers at the Value Stop) are completely able to hold their own; they are fully fleshed-out characters and just as fun to watch as Ash.

So my verdict: Ash vs Evil dead brings back everything that I loved about the original Evil Dead films, but it also manages to introduce interesting new characters and story lines which help maintain the element of surprise for long-time fans. And the show works just as well as a stand-alone story, so people unfamiliar with the original trilogy need not worry either: they will find just as much to love here as those who know and cherish Sam Raimi's classics - as long as they have a certain affection for trashy, gory horror comedies and don't expect serious drama (Six Feet Under this is not). In my book, this show is already a winner: 8 stars out of 10.

This series should be given how ever many seasons it wants to tell the story it wants to. No rushing. No messing with what Rami has in mind. No other series, EVER. Has continued a story so well from movies bring brought to tv and retaining the same feel. This show in some ways is historic for TV and should be setting presidents for all other rebooting/continuation whatever hollywood is doing right now. IT shows that new generation still likes real entertainment along with the old wanting more of the same great stuff they grew up with. Im in the middle ground at 28. And its just.. this show puts such a big smile on my face when i watch it. Its really rare for even straight up comedies to make me grin this hard"
Ash vs Evil Dead,Cancelled!!! What a shame.,"I love this show, it's funny. the effects are great and the cast works well together. I recently have seen that they are cancelling this show after 3 seasons. I personally think this is a huge mistake. While the ratings may not be what is expected (none are now that there are 200 channels to choose from) I always watched the show following this one. Well alas, no more. For those of you that are into the Walking dead, this is a show I personally think you would enjoy. The only difference is the comedic aspect and the shorter time allotment. Such a shame to see it go. It and the show following it were the only shows I watched on the Starz network.

P.S. to all of the other networks, the rating system is now antiquated with so many channels. Your better off looking to places like IMDB and TV.com to find out how many people are actually watching."
Ash vs Evil Dead,Such a ridiculously fun show!,I didn't know what to expect from Ash vs. Evil having never seen any of the movies. The reviews and ratings were so good and the trailer looked pretty good so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I had a blast watching this. Being a big Burn Notice fan I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell but he really shined here. It's too bad the series only lasted 3 seasons but it was long enough and didn't overstay its welcome. I never watched it when it was in and just binged the entire series in like a week. If you're looking for a ridiculously fun show where you can just turn your brain off then give this a try. You won't be disappointed.
Ash vs Evil Dead,Brilliant in every way!,"Very few times a classic like the original Evil Dead can not only be duplicated but transformed into a series. They stayed old school and only made it better. The directing, the writing and especially the acting is some of the best ever for this genre . I will debate anybody otherwise ."
Ash vs Evil Dead,Aces all 'round,"As most of the reviews state, this show really is the product of much care and love; from the writing to the vfx this show hits on all the things that make the Ash saga great. The comedy and subtle nuances of Ashley Joanne are fleshed out in ways that hammer on the what made the film series so loveable, while also nailing the horror down and creating some very fun gore. Heavy kudos to the DP, the show's cinematography, and the great acting by the Ghostbeaters. I'm saddened by the fact it's been cancelled but it's also got unlimited rewatchability; a very high bar that's relegated to select series for me: e.g. Twilight Zone, The Office, Twin Peaks, and a couple others. So, basically, if you dig Raimi, b-style horror, or just some fun gross out comedy check this."
Ash vs Evil Dead,We Want Season 4,"One of the best series i ever seen. It was a perfect sequel of evil dead movie, Cabin in the jungle, Blue jacket, that book everything.

Starz just cant end it this way. Bring back our bruce Campbell as Ash and give us a perfect end."
Ash vs Evil Dead,blood splattering fun,"Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) is an one-handed, trailer-living, dirty bar bathroom sex having slacker. It's been 30 years since his fight against evil and strange things start happening again. He accidentally drug-induced read from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis which he keeps in a trunk. The Evil is coming back. He wants to run away but co-worker Pablo Simon Bolivar sees him as El Jefe. New co-worker Kelly Maxwell at ValueStop gets pulled into the madness. Police officer Amanda Fisher survives a Deadite attack and follows Ash in her investigation. Ruby (Lucy Lawless) claims to be Professor Raymond Knowby's daughter and is searching for the Necronomicon. In the third and final season, Ash is joined by newly discovered teenage daughter Brandy.

This series is for anyone who enjoys blood-splattering fun. Bruce Campbell is full on Army of Darkness Ash. The first season is able to survive on the one joke where everybody else is surprised while Ash takes care of business. The second season gets re-energized by the addition of Lucy Lawless and the show stumbles onto the need of an actual antagonist. The third season is the best narratively and cohesively. There's a villain and an evil plan. It becomes a complete show just as Starz cancels it."
Ash vs Evil Dead,So Disappointing - Only one insignificant spoiler here,Comentario no disponible
Ash vs Evil Dead,So much freaking gory fun,"Fan of the Evil Dead series and you still haven't started this series yet? Then you're wasting your time reading IMDB - you'd better get Netflix if you haven't already (or whatever streaming platform on which this fantasgromiphic show currently resides), and start watching this hippodrome of gore and giggles, like right now.

It's not a perfect show. But it's pretty darn close. Any splatter-film fan will love it merely for the effects and fun deaths, but anybody else should love it for the humor, the story, the entertainment, and the fact that while taking a modern spin, it's still so similar to the original series.

So fans of the old stuff should be happy. Any horror fan should be happy. Anybody who doesn't mind over-the-top blood/guts should be happy. I don't even consider myself a huge fan of the original series, although I'd consider it all a horror staple, but this new series is off-the-charts hilarious and so much fun. Only advice is: DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. It's meant to be played for cheap laughs. It's meant purely to entertain. It's not meant to be deep, or thought-provoking, it's just meant to be a good, 'ol fashioned, 80's style, gore-fest, great-while-drunk-and-watching-with-your-roomates, extravaganza.

I don't wanna oversell it, but I've laughed every episode so far and I'm in the middle of season 2 as of this moment. There are rarely any dull moments. I'm right now absolutely loving the Ash ""muppet.""

Yes, like I said it has its flaws. But they are few and far in between. Honestly may come back later and give it a 10/10. (edit: I did!)

EDIT: just found out they canceled it. It's a travesty unmatched since they cancelled Firefly. What the blankity-blank-blank were Starz THINKING?!?? This series was GOLD. Well, at least we got 4 seasons instead of one. Or even zero. Enjoy it, kiddos! And don't forget to boycott other Starz shows until they bring this one back!!"
Ash vs Evil Dead,Most brainless clever fun I had in years,"Long time since I reviewed anything lately, but after watching up til season 3 episode 3, this show just screams for it.

For me this show is the pinnacle of netflix entertainment -> core elements are humor, gore, anything ridiculous can happen at any time, brainless nonsense, etc.

It's like the entire cast of Xena: Warrior princess are having a reunion and having a blast while at it (which shows). Casting is top notch and even while some scenes are obviously cringy, just objectively deconstruct the scene and see how fantastic they even pulled that off.

Acting, directing, producing, cinematography, music; really everything is on point.

Starz entertainment, thank you so much for taking this leap of Ash!"
Ash vs Evil Dead,What an absolute riot!,"Loved it loved it loved it. The original Evil Dead movie is still one of my favourite horror movies of all time! 2 and 3 combined humour with horror which was ground breaking back then. Always wanted an Evil Dead 4 and this 30 episode follow up 30 years later did not disappoint! Loved the combination of humour and bloodiness. Completely over the top with the spillage of blood and guts! Definitely my cup of tea. And Dana Delorenzo is so smoking hot as Kelly. Loved the bad girl vibe. It's just a pity that it all had to end. Come on Sam Raimi! Let's see more of what you got, all horror movie fans want more!"
Ash vs Evil Dead,Love It,"I have been a fan of the Evil Dead series for decades. I love it; the humor, the gore. I have always been a fan of B horror movies, like Reanimator, and Toxic Avenger, but Evil Dead, and especially, Army of Darkness, are my favs. This series was great. Ash was in top form, and I hope that there will be more to come in the future, so Give Me Some Sugar, Baby"
Ash vs Evil Dead,NO PLEASE TELL ME THIS IS NOT CANCELLED!!!,"One of the best comedies ever, to the cast kudos. Stick together and try to convince them you need another movie if not another year in the series"
Ash vs Evil Dead,"Awesome horror series, one of my favorite series","It has been a blast watching this series. I rarely watch series, except when they are exceptionally captivating. This series was fun, it never really got boring, and if it did some crazy gore made it awesome again. The great thing is that the series does not take itself too serious, too many series taking themselves too seriously these days.

In a nutshell: funny, great gore, nice action, not corny, unpredictable

So why the hell was it cancelled, please bring it back, it is a fantastic series."
Ash vs Evil Dead,Amaznig Show,"This was such a funny show with tons of action and gore. I seriously can't believe Starz is cancelling the show after 3 seasons. One of, if not the best, horror TV show available."
Ash vs Evil Dead,"Watch this or I'll send deadites after you!!! (Or don't, who cares)","Well, I am a fan of the original movie, duh. It's a classic and actually both funny and scary. I had heard of this series, but when it was introduced to Netflix Finland, I thought that now it's time to check it out. And the show is awesome. It moves constantly forward, there are no meaningless moments. The show is everything; raw, hilarious, gory and filled with likeable characters. (Bruce Campbell and Lucy freeeeaking Lawless are legends!) The best thing about it is that it's soooo faithful to the original story and atmosphere. It's like Evil dead the movie has been updated and given a longer story line. It still doesn't take itself too seriously and why should it?! I am now on the last episode of season one and I'm so sad there's only 20 episodes left! Whenever you feel like the movies and series nowadays lack real comedy and great storytelling, always remember Ash vs. Evil Dead. This show is just amazing. The only reason why I'm not giving it a 10, is some minor details, like how is it possible that the cabin is still intact and no officials ever investigated what happened there? Also some convenient stuff, like how can the trailer be so much bigger from the inside? But that's just me nit-picking.

EDIT: I just watched the last episode of the whole series and I am changing my rating from 9 to 7. The first season was honestly great but the second and the third turned in to a mess and even though I don't expect a series about Evil Dead to be the most logical series, the shread of logic from the first season was completely thrown away. I'm no longer that upset that they cancelled the show, I would have probably stopped watching it after this season. Such a shame."
Ash vs Evil Dead,So Underrated!!,If you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies or Army of Darkness you will love this show!
Ash vs Evil Dead,"An Ample Series, But Not Without Drawbacks","As a massive fan of the evil dead trilogy, I loved this series. It really did hit all the right notes for the those who adored the original movies, and with an even better production value, theres much entertainment to be found within all 3 seasons. Ash is back, and more badass and sarcastic than ever before. However, placing my inner fanboy aside now, there were some issues that became more and more apparent as the seasons progressed.

My main gripe with the series is that it takes itself very seriously at times. When there are scary scenes the show plays them straight. What made the movies wonderful for me was how cartooney it all was. Even with the violence and gore, it was comical and played more for laughs. You were laughing because of the absurdity of it all. Rarely were you supposed to be actually frightened by the things happening on screen. The series has some dark moments that dont fit the tone that the films had, and they seem out of place and forced.

Also there were too many side characters. It was painfully obvious who was to be cannon fodder for demons later on. Most of the time the side characters stay on the sidelines with not much to do while Ash reeks havoc. I always thought of Ash as the lone wolf with his burden to bear of killing demons, but I guess times change. A small complaint but something that became worse as the seasons progressed.

All in all it's still a great series with scenes of laughs and violence alike, especially for fans of the movies. Its great to see Bruce back with the chainsaw, but in the end it will only leave you wanting to rewatch the old classics."

Ragnarok,lost three stars for a crappy ending,Comentario no disponible
Ragnarok,Good show with an absolute awful ending,"I really enjoyed Ragnarok for the first two seasons, and even season 3 wasn't that bad until that last episode. Wow. What an awful, awful ending. Overall, I thought Ragnarok was so much better than I thought it would be. It's a really good adaptation of Norse myth and the battle between Gods and Giants. While it may start off a little slow for some, stick with it because it picks up in a hurry. You get used to the dubbed edit pretty quick or if it bothers you you can watch with subtitles. I prefer dubbed. Each season is only 6 episodes long so you can binge through it pretty fast. If you're a fan or supernatural or sci-if then you should give this show a chance, you will not be disappointed...until the ending that is."
Ragnarok,Glad isn't Hollywood,"Most series have so much of the same stuff, always very Hollywood looking and face washed. This is different, not only is not a american movie, but it shows a new take on today society without making a mockery out of it. Won't be for everyone taste, specially those used to more action and fantasy faling on the absurd. I recomend it and gave it a 8."
Ragnarok,A promising start,"I've watched two episodes so far, and will continue to watch. So far, I like it. It is different. Yeah, I'm a sucker for the superhero thing, but I'm quitting more and more series because I am starting to have enough of the U.S. patriotic clichés, the over the top drama and overacting. I enjoy these young Scandinavian actors, the slow way the story is unfolding, the lack of hysteria. It keeps me curious. The reviewers complaining about the environmental topic make me laugh. If you don't believe in it, just treat it as any other fantasy-topic. Aliens. Space zombies. Unicorns... It is a story. I am an atheist and I'm not whining about the presence of gods or supernatural stuff in this serie. That would be silly. All in all, give Ragnarok a try. Acquire a new taste...

Edit: Finished season 1 now. It only got better!"
Ragnarok,Taking the story back from Marvel,"I really enjoyed this series, showing in a better way the old mythology and religion of Scandinavia. People thinking that Marvels depiction of Norse Mythology is correct should be happily surprised to learn something else. Beautiful scenery and okay actors, combined with a good story. Looking forward to season2."

Ragnarok,Ragnarok: Enjoyable slow burn,"Plot

A small Norwegian town experiencing warm winters and violent downpours seems to be headed for Ragnarok -- unless someone intervenes in time.

Cast

Nobody I knew prior to Ragnarok but a host of people who consistently knocked it out of the park, Stakston's transformation alone was very impressive.

Verdict

My other half's choice, this perhaps would have been a lot further down the watchlist for me, I was hesitant. A modern telling of sorts of Thor? It didn't sit right with me and felt it was going to be over convoluted and fall flat, to my surprise from the very first episode it's actually really quite engaging and I found myself engrossed.

Not only this but it unconditionally kept my attention throughout the three seasons, it never wavered, it didn't have peaks and troughs, it was consistent in its quality.

So why? Decent enough writing, very solid cast and it went in directions I simply didn't expect, it's a lot of things but predictable isn't one of them.

It's not flawless, there's plenty of elements I didn't like and sadly the shows very core namely the Norse mythology was never something I was entirely on board with however I appreciated the subtlety and it's lack of attempt at being Marvel. Sure it's hokey and you have to suspend disbelief to an extent, but you do with all fantasy shows.

This show isn't a big cgi-fest, it's subtle, it's well crafted and it plays it vastly more serious.

What I don't understand however is the fans perception of season 3. The episodes are considerably lower rated and the finale seems to be universally despised. I get it, and yet I don't. Allow me to explain.

I don't like ambiguous endings, I don't need everything spelling out for me but generally I like to be in the ball park. Ragnarok's finale is very ambiguous and when it was drawing to a close I was very frustrated by this as I could see where it was going. However by the time the credits had rolled and the two distinct interpretations had reared their heads I found myself perfectly content with them. Maybe people aren't getting that, maybe people are simply assuming one over the other, maybe people like me just don't like ambiguous but were more stringent on that.

Me, I liked it. It doesn't matter which was the correct interpretation, both were deep, meaningful and neither took anything away from the show. At first I feared they'd pulled a Dallas on us, in reality it's far more multi-tiered and engaging than that. I simply don't understand the hate.

Rants

Oh dear, I thought that the criticism of the show was at least constructive even if I didn't agree with it. Filtering through the 1/10 reviews I as I should have expected found myself drowning in accusations of the show being propaganda and having an agenda due to the environmental parts of the story and the gay characters. Seriously, grow up. The existence of gay people in movies/tv is not an agenda, stop dressing your bigotry up as something its not. And the environment? You live on the same planet as me, you might want to start taking it a bit more seriously.

Breakdown Great cast Solid performances Consistency Concept still isn't my thing Too short."
Ragnarok,Surprisingly captivating series that came outta nowhere,"Between the beautiful scenery in almost every shot and the clean and efficient pace of the story, it's hard not to like in my opinion. The story flows so well, if in Hollywood hands we'd be bogged down with lame sideplot after sideplot that leads nowhere. I'm halfway through the season but had to write a review of how surprisingly great its been so far."

Ragnarok,Wohooo!!!!,Loved it:) First Norway gives us beforeigners and now THIS! Excellent show and I loved it!!!
Ragnarok,I don't get the low average ratings,"This show is actually pretty good compared to the comic book garbage. Bring more shows like it to Netflix, please!"
Ragnarok,"First season was good, second season not so much","Its an okay show overall, but it misses the mark many times throughout, and this I feel has a lot to do with its high-school setting, since its set in high-school, characters act like high-school kids, which are oftentimes incredibly awkward, dumb, indecisive and assholish.

Anytime, I complain about these characters, I hand wave it away and remind myself that there in high-school, so of course they're gonna act that way, but unfortunately that doesn't mix well with the magnificent tales of Norse mythology, and if anything it serves as a detriment, at least with how the writers have written it.

Another problem is its length and character development, with only 6 episodes, it feels really bad to watch characters being constantly indecisive or doing complete 180s with their personality, and it feels really unnatural when its too sudden, but if they just added more time, they could make character changes/development happen more gradually rather than out of nowhere, or they could keep it 6 episodes and just make the characters less indecisive.

Season 2 had a lot more promise than season 1, from where it left off in season 1, to the cool new characters introduced in this season, it really felt like it was going somewhere, but it hardly did, and it even had one of the most important/coolest characters brought in early on, but it ended being really disappointing, because that character was never developed to a proper extent this season, and was utterly pathetic in face of conflict/felt like a poorly thought out interpretation.

On the plus side, this show is pretty funny, looks beautiful, has a ton of potential, a lot of suspense, entertaining romantic relationships/potential relationships, decent drama, and good fight scenes."
Ragnarok,Surprised,I'm pleasantly surprised by this series. The first season looks really promising and i hope that there will be another one. I'm a Marvel fan and i really like the different look at this mythology.
Ragnarok,"If you plan to binge watch, don't waste your time","This was a good show with an absolutely HORRIBLE ending. I binge watched all three seasons- sadly, it felt like a waste of time. If you've already started, you'd might as well finish to finish the show- but I don't know who would be pleased with the ending. With the type of ending they went with, everything should've been explained and tied in a bow. However, there were still large plot holes and unanswered questions, somehow, which made it even worse. I have to give credit to the cast, very good acting overall. I also have to give credit to all for the first two seasons- they were good and the show had a lot of potential. Season 3 wasn't great, but the ending truly ruined it all. Very disappointing."
Ragnarok,Pretty Good!,"Ragnarok was so much better than I thought it would be. It's a really good adaptation of Norse myth and the battle between Gods and Giants. It's a little over the top but remains surprisingly entertaining all the while delivering a strong pro-environmentalist message. While it may start off a little slow for some, stick with it because it picks up in a hurry. It's a refreshing take on Norse mythology. You get used to the dubbed edit pretty quick or if it bothers you you can watch with subtitles. I prefer dubbed. Each season is only 6 episodes long so you can binge through it pretty fast. If you're a fan or supernatural or sci-if then you should give this show a chance, you will not be disappointed."
Ragnarok,What i think about season two so far.,Comentario no disponible
Ragnarok,I watched the whole season 1 in just 24hours! That js something!,"I watched this on Netflix. I thought it is gonna be cheesy like most movies nowadays but as I watched the first episode, I found myself getting ready and preparing snacks whilst watching this. Overall casts have done a great job, all casts are likeable, that I find myself frustrated as well like the main character Magne. I would have rated 10 stars on this if only I could understand and have the English translation subtitle whenever the Giant Family and Magne speaks the old ancient language of their kind. I hope Netlfix would fix it."
Ragnarok,They can not keep it grounded anymore...,"Just finished watching season 2. I won't give up any spoilers below so it is safe to read.

The season 2 picks up immediately after season 1. The one thing I really liked about this series is how they've kept it grounded. I also applaud the reasoning behind each season having 6 episodes; there's always something happening and there are not so many dull moments you can find in seasons that have 13 or more episodes.

If you liked the first season, I'm pretty sure you will like the second one. It's basically the continuation of the storyline with some new characters introduced. They did pretty convincing job of translating Norse mithology to modern times: pollution, obsession with power, rich vs poor...

Without going into any details, after finishing watching the second season, I had a bland taste in my mouth. The one thing that this show has it going (keeping it grounded) is the one thing that brings it down. They've introduced so many new stuff and events that simply ask for major budget and a big showdowns. Unfortunately, this season has none of that and the ending is less than climactic - it makes you sigh because you've spent 6 hours watching new episodes expecting something towards the end which never came.

If they want to continue keeping the interest of the audience, my honest opinion is they need to stop keeping it grounded and deliver those big fights they keep teasing about. I'm not sure if the budget of the series allows it, but the writers set up the storyline trying to follow as closely as they could Norse and Viking mithology which, in the end, if it doesn't go big, it will be waste of time. If they wanted to keep it grounded, they could have avoided some of the new stuff they've introduced in the second season.

Like I've said, if you liked the first season, you will probably like the second one, but I am sure you will be left wanting more after it ends. I really hope that they will have more budget in the third season. Yes, this series takes pride in modern retelling of the well known story and keeping it grounded, but with the direction they took in this season, I can't really say it's a ""grounded story"" anymore. Hopefully third one will be big and climactic or else... this will be a complete waste of time."

Girls Incarcerated,Will filming the girls actually improve their behavior and future?,"This review is less about the show and more about the psychological effect of putting a camera in someone's face while they are incarcerated. The show itself is very interesting, but shouldn't we consider how it might ruin any chance of a normal future? We have seen the negative effects of ""celebrity"" on so many people who are not incarcerated. Surely some of the prisoners might be inclined to act up just for screen time. Surely they might be inclined to remain incarcerated so they can remain on the show. How is this really helping?"
Girls Incarcerated,Original and touching series,"This series shows us that you can take control of your destiny and that it is never too late to become a good person. Moreover, this series is really interesting because it allows you to see the lives of teenage girls in a prison, which is rather original unlike other series where there are only adult men generally. This series is especially touching when they find their parents or when she leaves prison. I recommend it"
Girls Incarcerated,Makes me sad!,Comentario no disponible
Girls Incarcerated,COMPLETE & utter disregard for parents & authority. Period.,"These girls have had ""a hard life..."" whatever. They are disrespectful & have filthy mouths. They are where they belong until they face the real world and/or ""real"" prison just to put them in their place & show them just how ""bad-ass"" they are. I pray these girls see the light and change their direction, despite the upbringing & ""parenting"" they've been exposed to their whole lives. So so sad. The warden is a saint to me. NO WAY I could put up with these attitudes & mouths. God bless him!!"
Girls Incarcerated,Amazing,"Excellent series, exciting and real. You empathize a lot with girls and it makes you see a sad reality. Is admirable how them strive to save forward and change their destiny. Very good!!"
Girls Incarcerated,More Summer Camp Than Juvenile Hall!,"I get SO FRUSTRATED watching episodes and seeing how rotten these girls are behaving! Even the ones that are days away from leaving, the ones who are SUPPOSED to be ""rehabilitated!"" They are DISRESPECTFUL, swearing, antagonizing, and getting up in the face of each other, counselors, teachers, even GUARDS! They have NO respect for boundaries, and are CONSTANTLY getting into things that don't belong go them, even things that belong to staff! But the absolute KICKER is that the guards will stand there and tell them to do (or tell to not do) something 5-10 times, and the girls will stand there screaming cuss words & derogatory cuss names at the guards, and the guards just stand there repeating the same request in the same monotone voice, it's the textbook definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over, expecting a different response! These girls have NO structure, NO responsibility for their actions, NO discipline! There are FUNDAMENTAL reasons that the UNITED STATES PRISON SYSTEM was founded upon, and not the least was that any citizen able to be reformed and placed back into the public MUST BE reformed and not a threat to themselves or others. This system is FAILING these girls!!! Even at the exit interview, you don't have to read the room, the officer SAID that the girl has a hot temper and gets in fights a lot! But then she agreed go her release after I think only five months? Yeah, you gave the girl GREAT SKILLS to get by on the outside! The guy that's former USMC OOOHRAH! That they interview so often tried to say they only have a 17% recidivism rate I had to laugh so hard when I heard this! Just based on the first5 episodes alone, you can PLAINLY see that if he's getting 17%, it's only because he's cooking the books and not counting the girls that wind up in prison, or other Juvie Halls, or sadly, dead. These girls AREN'T being punished or getting their brains re-wired so they are able to avoid, and move-on from all of the things that were toxic for them when they go home, and are immersed back in the life, like being kicked out of a helicopter in nothing but your bikini as you're sightseeing icebergs! These girls are WAY over-indulged, they get SO MUCH more of EVERYTHING than people in prison that their sense of entitlement SICKENS me!!! All that money being spent in those personal tablets, the fancy gym & cardio equipment, the super long breaks with the TV and comfy chairs, Arts & Crafts equipment, etc. All that money coming out of OUR taxes, they're ungrateful for it, and if just the money for SOME if those extras could be sent to homeless outreach programs like the one my ex and I started, THAT could change and possibly SAVE lives! We are used to pinching pennies to make silver dollars, so we could make the impact a MUCH bigger one, AND the people WE take care of are so grateful, I've seen a homeless Vet cry over a hot cup of coffee! Hmmm a rotten girl who throws her $800 tablet in the ground until it's dead, OR a Vet crying over a $.25 cup of coffee (we also do soup, donated clothes, food, blankets, pillows, shoes, sack lunches, and we now own an older hotel that we fixed up, and put up as many homeless families as we can until they get back in their feet?) This Juvie Hall is nothing more than a 12 month indoor version of summer camp! As someone who has been training and in college to be a Profiler for the FBI, I find these conditions DEPLORABLE (and not in the Netflix ""World's Toughest Prisons kind of way!) But, for the fact that these kids are SO spoiled, and in the end, the only one they're hurting is the future victims, and these girls!"
Girls Incarcerated,Heartfelt,"Not as entertaining as jailbirds but with WAY MORE HEART. If every juvenile detention center was ran like this one, the world would be a better place. Seeing how the correction officers really want these girls to change, learn, and succeed in life is amazing. The stories are touching and need to be told. This is where the road to being a criminal begins for most, during the teenage years, and you see how these girls got on this path. It's sad but real and for me I felt compassion and sorry for most of the girls."
Girls Incarcerated,Brilliant/ emotional insight into the 'War on Kids'/ youth incarceration.,"Throughout this series you will laugh, cry, feel frustrated, angry, and just question everything about the system that has placed these children there.

I have to agree with one of the other reviews that questioned the impact this may have on the girl's future, especially given seem to be embracing the celebrity status already, however I feel this documentary needed to be made. You never really hear about what happens in juvenile facilities, but this provides a great insight.

What struck me the most was the lives all of these girls led before they entered the system in this way. Mostly all of them interviewed had severe issues with their family life - sexual abuse, parents in prison, parents using and encouraging drug use etc. It makes you question whether this is really the best we have to offer the struggling kids of America? Is incarcerating them the only way to get through to them? I'm doubtful. But I was pleased to see how well they were being treated when it came to receiving support/ schooling.

The one thing the show neglected to mention is how their time in juvenile facilities will affect their future. I know obviously as an adult this affects every aspect of their lives - applying for food stamps, accommodation, jobs etc. But do these records ever get wiped? Do they have to declare it when they go for jobs? I know these answers could be found with a google, but it would have been nice to have a narrator to tease out some of these conclusions at the end of the series.

What I'd really love to see next is a 'three years on' type chat show style one-off episode where the girls, with the use of hindsight (if we're lucky), get to talk about what they thought of the facilities/ their treatment, and whether they believed there were other options better suited for them. That'd be really interesting."
Girls Incarcerated,Amazing show!,"Amazing show! Very touching, gets you emotionally invested. I loved this and binge watched it all at once because I was so interested and couldn't wait to watch the rest... <3"
Girls Incarcerated,Highlights Serious Societal Problems,"Girls Incarcerated looks at serious societal problems and hints at the complex systemic issues around an Indiana reform school. Unfortunately, it fails to interpret or critique these issues, missing opportunity after opportunity to delve into the psychological and environmental issues that landed these girls in the criminal justice system to begin with.

The series glosses over a few of the horror stories that led to the featured girls' problems, but it provides none of the context that would easily show how political and social apathy, the prison industrial complex, and anti-science policymaking have created this mess.

The filmmakers repeatedly fail to critique the unscientific ""discipline"" and teaching methods that seem to be employed, and they never challenge the (probably illegal) anti-LGBTQ+ religious indoctrination that's rammed down these kids' throats at a taxpayer-funded institution. There's nothing in the series that adequately educates viewers on the generational trauma, parental failures, or psychological issues that drive juvenile delinquency/crime, and there's no acknowledgement that many of the methods employed here are actually major contributors to recidivism.

In short, the series is voyeuristic and shallow, offering no vision for improving these institutions. Instead, viewers are treated to poverty porn that may appeal to people with empathy but no serious interest in the complex solutions needed to fix our broken criminal justice system. It will also appeal to the lowest common denominator of conservative rage-watchers - the sort who will focus on all the wrong things (swearing, acting out) while failing to comprehend the systemic problems that created the bad behavior in the first place (hint: it's not just bad parenting). Worst of all, the show lacks the psychological and intellectual insight to show its viewers a better way. It offers a reality TV approach that never takes a meaningful position on anything, and the show is lifeless and vapid as a result. Once again, these girls deserved much better treatment than they got."
Girls Incarcerated,"Sad, Maddening yet Engrossing!","I'm going to agree with many reviewers that it was very hard to wrap my head around the style of discipline at this facility. The girls have all had very difficult lives and therefore must be treated differently and as individuals. I am sure we are not allowed access to many individual and group canceling sessions, so it's hard to say the facility is doing a bad job, but the girls do seem to get away with a lot of disrespect to the facilitators. The rules seem very lacks and non uniformed depending on the guard and or counselor, but they all do seem concerned for the girls well being. It is very engrossing to watch and you find yourself wanting to reach into the TV and hug the girls and say ""you can do this, life dealt you a bad hand, but you got this."" I do hope that Netflix' finds a way to not make celebrities out of these girls like TLC has done with the 90 day franchise, as I fear it would compound unresolved issues that are better dealt with in counseling and not on social media. In that regard I'm torn between wanting the show to succeed or not."
Girls Incarcerated,Sad girls trapped in a terrible system,"These poor girls. I see other reviews going off about the girls language and disrespect. Well, what do you expect when you put 20(?) traumatized girls in the same room day in and day out with little-to-no privacy, guards who know very little about deescalating conflict, lack of addressing their very serious and gruesome trauma, an outdated silly form of ""discipline"" and point systems, to name a few? A fourteen year old girl with anger management issues and you expect her to behave like a normal kid? And you lock her up in this institution? I have no words for how sick this is. This is not only trauma and poverty social porn, but also yet another insight on everything wrong about the American prison system. An interesting watch if you look beyond the drama and foul language."
Girls Incarcerated,This is very upsetting,This show is insane! I can not believe these young girls are acting this way! It is like wild animals in a cage! Watching this will make you want to reach in the TV and give some of the girls a strong long hug and let them know they are LOVED and worth more then how they are behaving! I do not understand why they are not punished for how they speak! Their choice of words is just dreadful and should be void. I can not wrap my head around parents who have these children and do not teach them right from wrong! If you can not be a GREAT role model for your child then place them in a loving home.
Girls Incarcerated,Three Years Later,"This ""show"" should come with a warning for those looking for scandal or clickbate. It's not made to exploit children or teenagers for being ""bad"", despite the ill-named title. On the contrary, this show sticks with you. And if you have any compassion or hope for people who have experienced real difficulty in their lives, this show won't leave your mind, even after several years.

I've seen other reviews, complaining how the employees say the same thing several times while receiving little to no response from those under their care. This is part of what makes it such a good environment for the so-called inmates. Compassion is something many of them have never seen. Selfless parenting is something many have lacked. This facility (and the second in season 2) represents an environment which is meant not to force, but to diffuse. Not to coerce, but to draw slowly. Will everyone respond? No. Will everyone who responds succeed in the real world? No. But that is not the point. At the end of the day, these girls / women are individuals, who are fully capable of making their own choices. The question is, does this environment help or hinder them?; encourage or discourage them?; set them up for success or failure? IMHO, it does everything a facility of this type should do. And that's more than people can say for many ""jail"" type facilities.

And the end of the day, for anyone who doesn't understand the show, I question your own life experience more than the series itself. It's not something to be entertained by. It's lives to be fascinated and drawn in by. This is one of the most important and vulnerable looks at young people and the results of their lives, for better or worse. I hope everyone who takes the time to watch this series will also take the time to receive what it has to offer."
Girls Incarcerated,Petty drama over and over,"It's Keeping up with the Kardashians except ghetto version in jail. With overweight girls who look like they haven't showered or brushed their teeth in weeks. If you like reality shows with endless amounts of pointless bickering, you might enjoy it. Who threw who's ipad on the floor and what someone did in return to get back at them and being told for the millionth time ""it's not right to do that."" Then girls working on a computer, taking notes, being put in ""time out"" (yes they actually call it that), arguing with staff for entertainment, occasionally getting out and talking to their parents about how they won't do bad things anymore (hint: they do). Pretty much sums up the show."
Girls Incarcerated,Great series to watch for laughs as teens in prison pretend they are tough thugs.,"While prison shows are always interesting, shows with kids under 18 always make me laugh. Something about teens and their lack of maturity pretending they are super bad*ss. Series can be sad of course because of how young they are. But its also great if you need something to laugh at. Every adult knows these teens would not make it in a adult prison. And facts are most teens who move onto to adult prisons, end up crying for their parents right away.

Fact is they don't realize a teen prison is easy because, you know, its full of teens. About as scary as a sloth coming to attack you. They are mixed in with other teens who all compete to be ""thug"" like and it shows how sad they are that they think it actually impresses anyone.

In adulthood and in adulty prison, no one really is scared of your teenage thug wanna be attitude. To them, your just easy pickings as fresh meat to control. Sadly you can tell most of these girls think they are that 1% of teens that can make it in a adult prison.

That's the only part I feel bad about. Not realizing teen prison is very different from adult prison. Most of them running their mouths get away with it in teen prison. In adult prison you just get thrown to the ground, get masked and thrown in solitary. And if you run that mouth again adults, you will likely end up shanked or at the least, beat up.

I'd love to see a future series to see if them make it to adult prison so we can get some extra laughs as they endlessly cry and get put into place by not only the officers, but by other inmates who are actually hardcore thugs you never want to mess with.

---edit--- After starting season 2, I have to say I have some mixed views now. Some of the girls do try to change as a person for the better. Which is great to see. However some still just fall back into their ways once back in the streets. In one case with Cassie, her mom easily gets enraged. Cassie makes excuses for her mom, but she fails to see her mom doesn't care that much if she hasn't gotten help to control her rage. Because that will still end up bringing back Cassies anger issues also. She needs to move out when she's 18 to a calmer environment

Admiteddly many of these kids come from tough streets or run down cities. Which tends to lead to troublesome kids."

Girls Incarcerated,"This is a horrible show, they are not teaching these kids anything...","IMO this show is exactly what's wrong with youth today! They have no discipline and no respect for the staff and it seems as though we are just warehousing these kids until we release them back into the same environment they got them from. I watched season one and it seemed that most of the young ladies were heading in the right direction but this season the girls just seem worse. In fact they seem to be bragging about their crimes and no remorse for the victims at all. Their language is horrible, the outburst and behaviors (these time out rooms are a joke). The female staff at LaPorte did a great job checking their attitudes, the men seemed to have no idea what to do with these young ladies and are easily manipulated by these girls it seems very sad. I think they need a more strict program."
Girls Incarcerated,wow,So no young adult living in Indiana was taught to speak proper English?? Seriously??? WOW....
Girls Incarcerated,Absolutely stupid,Watched the first 5 minutes of the first episode and it is nothing but children thinking they are hard because of their bad parents. I'm sure these kids will get their money when the get out.

Lucifer,Tom Ellis is such an underrated actor!,"Lucifer really surprised me by how much I enjoyed it. First of all, I can't say enough about Tom Ellis. He is perfect for this role. I know a lot of people have already said this but he's a really underrated actor. I can't wait to see what he does next. Lucifer is based off the Neil Gaiman comics. It's part fantasy, part comedy, part mystery, among other things. Some of the seasons seem a bit stretched out with some filler episodes but overall every season is terrific. Lucifer was canceled by Fox after three seasons but the fans were so upset and loud about it that Netflix picked it up and it continued for another three seasons, ending after Season 6. I already miss this show now that it's gone. We'll always have the reruns though."
Lucifer,Enjoyed It!,I have to say that I enjoyed Lucifer a lot more than I thought I would. It takes a really unique spin on police procedurals that works very well. The best part of this show though is easily Tom Ellis as Lucifer! He's such an underrated actor and deserves to be a bigger star than he is. Hopefully once this show wraps up after the series ends next season he will get his chance at superstardom! Going to miss this show once it's gone.
Lucifer,Great Series,"I am 2 series in and just love this show.

I would say that this is (so far at least) on par with another series that I love, Grimm.

Tom Ellis as Lucifer is just brilliant!"
Lucifer,Show is 100X better now that Netflix picked it up,Thank Luci himself that fox cancelled this show because Netflix is doing a much better job only one season in!
Lucifer,Lucifer - 6 Brilliant Seasons and Wow What a Ride,"I have loved this show since day one, and an avid fan of all three of the prior season before Fox stupidly cancelled it, which actually was a gift. I was one of the fans that worked in the twitter campaign to help save the show,working along with the producers, writers, cast, crew and fans from around the world, with the hashtag #SaveLucifer making history, as Netflix was more than eager to give this show a fabulous new home. So now this series is even better, the new Season 4 just released May 8 2019 is so much more, despite only 10 episodes, they are packed with action, drama,it is bolder, yet the humor in the show is still there, it is definitely the best season yet. For new viewers, do watch the first 3 seasons before the new one, as the characters history is important to this story. I am just finishing doing a binge watch for the third time and it just never gets old. Treasure of a show, great actors, good tight writing, great set designs, cool music throughout, and even a little nudity. What more can you want. Netflix, we need a season 5,6,7 and on.

2019 Update: After yet another fan campaign and good reviews for season 4 on Netflix, we got season 5, although it will be the last and we really wanted 6 seasons, But then Netflix listened, and gave the show twice the episodes for season 5, another win. Can't wait, the writers keep tweeting us the episode titles and have promised the best season yet.

Update for Season 5.1 released Aug 21: AWESOME. One of the best seasons yet. We get some answers, some closure on some things (keeping this spoiler free for you), many of our favorite characters go through unexpected changes, and a new bad guys appears in a familiar face. Best acting ever from this amazing cast. Lots of funny moments too. The second half of season 5 is almost finished and will be on Netflix later, and we are also getting a Season 6 in the future. Just an amazing show, brought back to life by amazing fans, writers, producers, actors and thanks to Netflix.

Update for final season 6. September 10 2021 Just finished watching. These writers amaze me. They gave the fans so many things they knew we wanted. Maybe not in the way we expected, but something for everyone. Lots of action, lots of laughter and definitely some tears. Closure. Tied up loose ends . Some characters reappear. Just an amazing group of writers and producers and a fabulous cast. Good writers know when to stop. They told their story, the way they wanted to, working with the desires of the fans, and gave it the ending they wanted. Sure I would have watched it for dozens of more seasons, and still would have loved it, but actors and writers have to move on. The six season ( really 7 when you count the double number of episodes in season 5). , yeah, six was a good number. You will love this final seaon. There will be music. Dancing. Laughter. Tears. Surprises. A hell of a ride."
Lucifer,#SaveLucifer #PickUpLucifer,"#SaveLucifer #PickUpLucifer

One of the best shows around. It deserves to continue right where it left off."
Lucifer,Recommended,"FIRST SEASON : 9/10

SECOND SEASON: 9/10.

THIRD SEASON : 8/10.

FOURTH SEASON : 8,4/10.

FIFTH SEASON : 8,3/10. (First part : 7,7/10, second part: 8,8/10)

SIXTH SEASON : 7/10.

First and second are the best seasons of this tv show, no filler episodes, pure entertainment and the chemistry between Ellis and German is great. So good that i place them amongst my favorite seasons of every tv show i have watched, and i have watched a lot of them.

Third season includes some of the best episodes of the whole show. However, there are many filler-mediocre episodes here. A DEVIL OF MY WORD is probably the best episode of LUCIFER.

Fourth season is more ""tight"". No filler episodes, better production, Lauren German's acting is getting better (I love her character but she is not the best actress of the world). Magic is still there, but the best episodes of this season are not as good as the best episodes of former seasons.

Fifth season is uneven. First part lost a step. But the second part made a glorious comeback, reminding the former greatness of this show.

Sixth season is the worse season by far, but it's not bad. Just pales in comparison with the previous ones. Could have been better, the subplot with daughter was not very good but it was still a good season overall. And the ending is satisfying.

........................................................................................................................................................... Tom Ellis created one of the most charming, magnetic and charismatic characters in the history of television. Supporting characters were likeable and interesting too, this would not have been so successful without them. This is the definition of entertainment, if you are looking for a fantasy comedy/crime tv show. It's light-hearted, fun and very touching at some times. At its core, it's a romance. A love story. Never recaptured the magic of the first three seasons, but i would gladly watch 10 seasons more."
Lucifer,"EXQUISITE, until it wasn't.","*This is a review for the entire series*

The first couple seasons of Lucifer were amazing. The show had a gripping formula of (good) procedural storytelling intermixed with an entertaining heaven/hell mythology. Tom Ellis is a massive reason for the success of the show. His portrayal of Lucifer is spot on. The charisma just jumps right off the screen and he also displayed the ability to create emotional moments that resonate with the viewer. The character feels real and Tom's ability to carry a complicated show on his shoulders with ease can't be understated.

You can definitely see why Netflix picked up the show when it was cancelled because the show didn't deserve to be cancelled at all.

While the first couple seasons of the show were tight, engaging and well written, the latter half of the show's run suffered from poor writing. Of course this is just my opinion, but I think the writers struggled with Lucifer and Chloe's relationship, the side characters being removed from the central action and the balance between the procedural and mythology aspects of the show.

The first couple of seasons would have gotten an 8 from me but since I have to judge the entire show on a whole, my rating is being reduced to a 6."
Lucifer,I hope & pray another network picks up LUCIFER,As we all know by now FOX cancelled LUCIFER. I love that show. I hope and pray another network picks up LUCIFER. I think the best network to pick up LUCIFER is the CW. LUCIFER would fit right in the CW wheelhouse along with SUPERNATURAl and all the other shows like that the CW has. FOX which always cancels anything really good that people really like cancelled LUCIFER while leaving one hell of a cliffhanger.
Lucifer,Great until Season 6,"I have loved this show up and watched episodes multiple times until this latest season. I would have given them a 10 rating before Season 6.

In Season 6, it felt like the writers forgot what created so many fans and instead focused on trying to include every single social issue they support in the last season. I do not fault them for wanting to include a social issue important to them that naturally fits, but it felt like they were checking off a list to make sure they included transgender, feminist, BLM, police issues, as well as biracial and LGBTQ relationships.

Gone was the cheeky humor, the fun group dynamics and hijinks of the main characters, the playful banter with Chloe and Lucifer, crime solving, Lucifer singing and playing the piano, fun dance numbers, romance with Deckerstar, the supernatural aspects and other angel family members. There were bits here and there, but largely it was overshadowed by the social issues and 3 long drawn out episodes to say goodbyes. It wasn't funny. The characters were stiff with each other. It was boring. I kept watching just to see if it got better. If this season had been the 1st, I never would have watched the show. So sad that this was how this show ended."
Lucifer,"Like a Guardian Angel, Netflix offers salvation to the doomed.","Thank you Netflix. Just as ""Serenity"" gave us back our ""Firefly"", and the SyFy Channel gives us back our Sci-Fi, Netflix has given us back our ""Lucifer"" ,True to the original concept but with some real added value in mythological story-telling. Eve was an interesting charachter. I had her pegged at being Lillith until named as Eve. Lauren German as gorgeous as ever. But mein gott did she look absolutely stunning in the masquerade party sequence with the dark eyeliner egyptian eye of Ra Schwarzze Sonne sequence. Lucy is at his glorious best and worst demon and daemon self. A true Lokian trickster. Eye candy for all the future mother mary's rocking and rolling around on molly in a meaningless existence. The Norse Vikings had a concept of the biblical ""End of Days"" termed ""Ragnarok"". Our world will be destroyed at the end of time, but the world will be reborn and a new time will be birthed. Lets hope ""Lucifer"" will be reborn into the New World of Netflix. Season Five. It does have a devilish symmetry to it. It takes 5 to make a pentagram. A Glorious Gesture to Netflix is to keep giving the love, so they keep giving the love back to us. The Gods of Hollywood abandoned us decades ago. Netflix is the better devil I know."
Lucifer,One of most entertaining crime television series,"First there was Bones (2005-2017) a feel-good crime drama duo that was just ending its run as Lucifer was beginning. Both these television crime series had solid engaging episode plots but with the added bonus of the fascinating interaction between the male and female lead roles. In Lucifer, there is the added fun supernatural twist. The evolving story arcs provide a continuing fascinating, oftentimes emotional, riveting backstory with both series. With Lucifer the screenwriters push it up a delicious notch. The last shorten season is spectacular though the last two episodes fail to meet the highest standards of excellence even though both are fine and offer a more than satisfying conclusion for anyone having made the commitment to watching the entire series. Some of the more entertaining, stress-reducing television experiences that allow for plenty of re-runs and multiple screenings into the future."

Lucifer,I Tried,"If you have read the graphic novel, this show is essentially ruined... I'd like to say I went through the entire first season, but I couldn't do it. I don't, to be clear, dislike this because it's different from the comics... It's a different format, so differences are expected and things can be good on their own...

But, to be frank, the characters are bland and uninteresting. What they did to Lucifer is bad, turning him into a sleazy ***, but what they did to Mazikeen is incomprehensible... I have never seen such an interesting character so neutered, and the relationship between Lucifer and Mazikeen was truly unique in the novels. It was vaguely disturbing to watch. I'd watch iZombies if you want an interesting supernatural cop procedural, and read the original novel Lucifer! At least those things are worth your time..."
Lucifer,One of the best tv show,On of the best tv show🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lucifer,all about Ellis,"Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis) is the devil. He's tired of Hell and takes a break in L.A. He's running his nightclub Lux with demon disciple Mazikeen (Lesley-Ann Brandt). His brother Amenadiel (D.B. Woodside) demands that he returns to Hell. When a celebrity is killed in a drive-by, police detective Chloe Decker (Lauren German) investigates. He finds himself strangely attached to her and becomes a police consultant. He has the power to draw out a person's inner desires. She's divorced from fellow detective Dan Espinoza (Kevin Alejandro) and single mom to Trixie. Psychiatrist Linda Martin (Rachael Harris) can't keep her hands off of him. In the second season, his mother Charlotte (Tricia Helfer) arrives with an agenda against his father and Ella Lopez (Aimee Garcia) is the new forensics investigator.

This network show is based on a DC comic. It is fun supernatural police thriller. Most of the fun comes directly from Tom Ellis. He is utterly devilish fun. It's all him. Tricia Helfer is a terrific addition but this show really centers around Ellis. He's got the charm, and the playful irreverence. He's perfect for the character. The show manages to add upon the police procedural format by bringing in some great story development. It's a lot daddy issues. It's rather disappointing to have the show canceled after 3 seasons.

ADDITION: There's a 4th season and maybe more after the show gets picked up by Netflix. It gets a little darker with more work on the serial aspect. A little more is asked from Lauren German and she does her best. It's an interesting redirection."
Lucifer,Amazing series,"The combination between crime, romance and fantasy is amazing. Each character has their own style and brings life to the series. Despite the many episodes and seasons, it never gets boring. One of the best series I've ever watched."
Lucifer,Cancelled? Just Why....?,"How can you cancel the greatest show ever. In a world full of crap this was the only show that made me happy to watch. And Season 3 episode 24 was amazing. I am praying for being renewed. I am pretty sure that for so much money you can make up with good ideas. I understand that from now on it will be hard, but don't do the same as The Sicret Circle! Please! I give the show 10 out of 10!"
Lucifer,"Five great seasons, then came season 6","We thoroughly enjoyed the first five seasons, refreshing, properly predictable, and then came season six. Way too heavy on the social injustice platform, police brutality etc.

Lucifer,Downward spiral!,"This show really loses its soul and nerve in season 5, emerging into something of a spin-off of a kids or modern family type of show. Clearly, the writers of the show don't know what it is (was) or wants to be anymore."
Lucifer,Devilishly good taste in humour,"Unfortunately I found out yesterday that Lucifer has been cancelled. As light hearted shows go it was a winner, the whole cast went for it and did a great job. Lucy, Maze, Douche, Amenadiel, and Linda were flawless in their roles. Perhaps Chloe could have removed the big wooden pole from her backside a bit more often but hey, she looked good. Its strange how good shows like this get chopped and absolute rubbish like IZombie keeps getting renewed and its really really rubbish.

Update: Well the show got a couple more seasons, and I'm greatful for that. Perhaps a couple of episodes in season 6 (5B) were a little Woke-ish but what shows aren't these days. Without giving any spoilers away, everybody gets a happy ending including Chloe's daughter. And the humour kept on flowing even in the saddest moments, the last episode had the wife in bits and something got caught in my throat truth be told. I gave it a rating of 10, two years ago and that still stands."

Manifest,Guilty pleasure,"Started very well. Reminded me of good old days from the first season of Lost. During the way, the show looses itself. Bad actors, bad script, zero logic... but its just that thing that ""well, i'm already here... so let's keep watching"". I would say... if you have better things do to with your time, go for it. But if you stick to the end, besides it all, i found the final message pretty sweet. This is one of those series to watch without big commitments or expectations... for crochetters like myself, the best serie to be passing while you divide your focus with some knots. Oh, and take some deep breaths on some episores where you just wanna quit lol."

Manifest,"Interesting plot line, not such great acting, getting a bit boring","Started out with a new and interesting theme. Some of the acting is terrible and one of the main characters consistently looks puzzled, no matter what emotion he is supposed to be portraying. Getting past his annoyingly horrific on screen persona is very problematic as he is so unbelievable when he is mad or sad or happy....he just always looks dumbfounded, sort of like a deer in headlights and it is very distracting from the plot.

They need to pick up the pace of this because it is starting to DRAG with very boringly predictable plot lines of the government vs them.

It has a LOT of potential and I would hate to see it canceled before the big reveal."

Manifest,Mixed feelings... Good potential,"I was very hopeful when I saw the previews for this program. I wasn't, however, hoping for such a focus on the sci-fi (or whatever you want to call it) aspects. Like others said, this is reminiscence of a Lost or similar program in reverse. I had hoped this program would focus mainly on stories of the passengers integrating back into their old lives, dealing with all the changes that had taken place in those five and half years. The focus seems split more than I'd like it to be, although, let's be honest - if this had happened in real life, we can be sure the authorities, the scientists, and everyone else would be following their every move until an answer was found.

That said, I disagree with some who claim the acting is lackluster. The acting is low key and subdued, just the way most real people live. If the actors were overly dramatic, it would change the thrust. This is low key real life behavior or people who are supposed to be genuinely confused. In that regard, I think the acting is fine.

All pilot episodes have to accomplish a lot - they have to capture the attention of scores of people, all with different interests. I suspect better is yet to come. Many shows are discarded by folks before the programs are ever given a chance to develop, one way or another.

I intend to watch this program for at least a few more times. If it goes downhill, that will be it. However, I think it has good potential to last for at least a few seasons and keep us interested."
Manifest,Dump Grace,I started binge watching this show yesterday. Plot is interesting but most characters are not. Grace drives me nuts. She flip flops all the time. I cannot believe anyone in her sphere can tolerate her!!
Manifest,Manifest's Final Chapter: A Mix of Closure and Lingering Questions,"The ending of Manifest left me with mixed emotions. While it provided closure to some storylines, it left many questions unanswered. The rushed pacing and compressed resolution felt unsatisfying. However, the heartfelt character moments and the final revelation had a poignant impact. Despite the flaws, the performances remained stellar. Overall, I appreciate the show's attempt to tie up loose ends, but I can't help but feel a sense of longing for a more comprehensive and fulfilling conclusion. Despite the shortcomings, Manifest will be remembered for its intriguing premise, engaging characters, and the way it kept viewers guessing until the very end. It's a bittersweet conclusion that will leave fans pondering the mysteries long after the final episode fades to black."

Manifest,Ending Made the Rest Worthwhile,"This had a great start, then softened a bit in the middle. But the final season got back on track and the ending - wow. Most of the actors are awesome. They portray real personalities. Sometimes what they go through is hard to fathom, but it all works in the end. I ended up having to binge watch most of the final season.

Should there have been another season? They certainly could have filled it with more twists and turns, but no, that would have just dragged it on too long. When I heard that Season Four would be the last I was disappointed. But it turned out to be just right.

This could possibly offend someone's religious sensibilities because beliefs are infinitely varied. But it's only a story. And it's a good one."

Lost was good in the beginning, but I slowly lost interest as it just became ridiculous to believe in. I'll give it a few more weeks, I really hope it surprises me"
Manifest,Grace issue,"Grace extremely annoys me... Come on, guys , create character more realistic without so intensive false caring about kids and others issues."

Manifest,"Make your own mind up, it is what you make of it. It does NOT deserve the low score.","I never usually do reviews, but on this occasion I felt I had too. I read some of the reviews before watching this like I usually do, but think I'm gonna stop doing it beforehand. Why? Because most of the negative reviews about this show are about how 'it got boring so gave up' well I am on episode 14 now and I am well and truly hooked! You don't need constant action to make a story, but each episode you get a different story about one of the passengers and another little piece of the mystery unravels, it really is what you make of it and how much you put your mind to it... PLEASE don't give up if you start watching it....yeah it's not the most amazing show I have ever watched, but hey, it really doesn't deserve the low score it has."
Manifest,"interesting plot, generic writing","I'm not one to watch a network show like this, but my mom wanted to watch it so i figured why not. the personal storylines are cheesy and predictable, but the overall arc of this story is interesting. i am curious as to what happened on the plane. i'd watch the show to see what unravels, but this isn't some life changing television."
Manifest,Great series don't listen to the negative reviews,"Honestly the beginning of season 1 is kind of slow paced and this s what some people might have based their opinion on. Which is to bad for them because they lost an opportunity to appreciate an interesting and intriguing storyline. There are no limits to where the writers could go with this concept because anything is possible, but the most important is as long they keep us hooked with more action about the super natural and less about the characters personal lives which is what television series have a tendency to drag on and make the viewers lose interest. But with the way season 2 has begun, I'm already anticipating season 3 cross my fingers. Great storyline very interesting and intriguing, great acting, great directing, great job."
Manifest,Not bad but much too long - learn from Korean series...7-9 episodes is plenty for linear story like this...,"The premise of the show is great - sci-fi based, with decent acting, production etc... the problem here which seems to infect many such series is that being linear program it is much too long to keep me interested. I mean 62 episodes to solve the mystery and find the truth is not for me... more recent Korean series have been much more appropriate with 7-9 episodes, or Stand alone series like xfiles, Star Trek etc... unfortunately, not willing to waste 62 episodes to solve this single mystery and will need to give it a miss at episode 4..."
Manifest,Has potential... let's see,"I think the premise is interesting, not sure how much sci-fi will come out of it, I think that will make or break the show. I'd like for it to be a little more realistic.

It reminds me of 'Under the Dome' before the twist came out and *under the dome spoiler* it was about aliens... and became dumb and then sadly canceled. Hopefully, Manifest doesn't follow suit."

Manifest,Enjoying reading these reviews more than watching the show,"People writing these reviews far more clever than the writers of this show. Its been 3 seasons, throw us a bone already !! Too much filler and not enough solid clues to figure out what is going on. And yes the main male actor is so over the top he's become really annoying. By this time one usually finds at least one of the characters likeable but no. Not this time."
Manifest,First episode,"Interesting premise, but not great acting and kind of cheesy production so far. Will probably give it a chance for a couple of episodes more..."
Manifest,I think it will be a great show,"Before i start watching the show, i revied what people wear saying: it's not good or its just like (Lost) well i didnt like Lost and didn't watch more than 3 episodes of lost, so Manifest look promising and i like the idea behind it. Just give it a chance."
Manifest,"The callings , the callings , the callings, the.....","Season one starts off interesting and had decent enough pace and story. Lately tho it's been losing steam fast. I tend to be playing on my phone more and more each week during episode. In fact I am writing this review during the show. It's seems like half of the script now is just saying ""the callings"" or ""the death date"". Very much like the writers have no clue week to week as to the point of the show. Unless something dramatically changes soon, they need to just wrap this story up ASAP and call it quits at end of the season. It's getting kinda rediculous."
Manifest,Looked promising but bad acting and bad scenario,"What started interesting quickly became very boring. Mystery is one of my favorite genre of series and that's what made it appealing to me. The first episode started promising even though I already had my doubts after some bad acting and annoying characters. I gave it a shot anyway, until episode four, and then I couldn't take it anymore. It's just isn't quality and that is required nowadays when you see all the great shows there are. I'm not going to continue losing my time on this one. I'm normally not a quitter but in this case I surrender and move on to something better."

Dating Around,Good for binge watching,"Looks like all dates are scripted,didn't liked Sarah lol. But beautifully filmed,thats a big plus,doesn't look like others reality shows."
Dating Around,The Bachelor/ette,"This is like one season of The Bachelor in every epsiode. Nicely done, includes characters for everyone I think. Very down to earth and if your are into that you might like this mini series."
Dating Around,Reality dating show with a semblance of reality,"Dating Around is a reality show that tries to do something truly novel--imitate and capture reality. In the show, a random person goes on five blind dates in the same locations, and gets to choose one at the end to go on a second date. The dates are spliced together for the audience into a montage, so we literally get to see all five dates happen more or less simultaneously, and suspense builds as we wonder who the person will choose. The final scene is the person meeting up with their choice for the second date.

The premise is pretty simple, and seems even a bit old-fashioned, harkening back to shows like the Dating Game, where contestants get to spend a little time with multiple potential matches and then select their favorite. I like it better than ""reality"" shows that seem to exist in completely unreal situations--like Too Hot to Handle or Love is Blind--it actually feels like we are watching a real date. Contestants have claimed that the show is not scripted, that beyond choosing the potential matches the producers did not really know what they would end up with. I have often wondered what an artful reality show would be like, and this strikes me as a good possibility--a show that actually tries to capture real situations for the purpose of entertainment or general interest. This show does exactly that, and it is indeed very satisfying when the contestants do sometimes find real connections."

Dating Around,Left me wanting more!,"Loved this show. Uniquely different. I'm not going to overthink it or micro analyze it. Bottom line: I found it refreshing and it entertained me. Period. End of story! ""Netflix, if you're listening, DO MORE EPISODES!""."
Dating Around,"So simple, it's good","Trashy reality TV that doesn't pretend to be something it's not. Extremely well edited, with a few warm and fuzzy moments mixed in (as long as you're not currently heartbroken or desperately dating). If you're confidently single, there are some decent one-liners coming your way. But good to pair some wine, junk food and absent-mindedly playing on your iPad."
Dating Around,It's all FAKE,"No one else notice the background/extras never change? This guy would be, not only extremely full from all the food but DRUNK. All these dates and the people sitting behind them NEVER change??? Yet it shows him leave with every date. The show isn't set up like a round robin, he meets them at the bar, has dinner, then walks them home... YET the next date has the same diners in the background."
Dating Around,Honestly,I usually can't stomach this sort of program but I was really pleasantly surprised. While some of it definitely feels scripted I got a much more genuine feeling and actually enjoyed the dialogue between dates. I especially enjoyed the two LGBTQ episodes and the episode with the older folks. All actually left me smiling. Wound up watching the whole season in one sitting. Netflix keeps on pleasantly surprising.
Dating Around,Interesting. Avoid Sarah episode at all costs.,Comentario no disponible
Dating Around,Beautifully Shot,"On the surface, this is another ridiculous dating show.. but it's shot beautifully like a movie - and really, this is a case study of the different types of people in New York, from the really annoying rats to charming nice folks.

Reality shows are never ""real"" and I think this show recognizes that and just presents the multiple dates in a cohesive way for storytelling."
Dating Around,Painfully awkward,"Thanks Netflix. Just when my faith in humanity was slowly being restored you drop this on me and completely shatter it. A collection of vain, vapid idiots can be ok in a movie when it has a point, but like all reality TV they aren't in on the joke and therefore become unbearable. A good litmus test on whether to go running in the other direction from a new acquaintance is if they would do a show like this. Truly dreadful"
Dating Around,Boring,"I don't like the format of this show, where they just focus on one person dating lots of others. It makes it seem fake and hard to root for anyone in particular. I feel sorry for the dates who have to try so hard to compete with each other. It feels like a meat market. But what makes it really boring is that we never get any feedback on what the characters are thinking. In First Date we get regular checkins to know their thoughts, which is the really interesting part.

You are left puzzled at the end as to why the protagonist chose the one they did. Admittedly I only watched two episodes. That was enough for me as it was too much of a yawnfest."
Dating Around,Season 2: LA !!,"Whether this is real or not ( and some of it feels scripted, but could be coached like the bachelor is) it is edited and pieced together nicely. To me it serves as a quick how to of dating for the inexperienced or unseasoned. I would like to be first in line to audition for season 2, ( I did audition for the Bachelor) and it should obviously be set in Los Angeles. There's lots of real estate agents and entrepreneurs here too 😂."
Dating Around,The fakest of fakes,"The fun part is how fake it all is. But like small movies, it's well produced and filmed. But man it's fake."
Dating Around,It felt like eavesdropping,Comentario no disponible
Dating Around,Unwatchable Nonsense,"I wanted to like this show, I really did, as there are far too few dating and relationships ""reality TV"" shows on tv any more. They're cheap to produce, and the Bachelor makes a mint for ABC, but for some reason no other network can make a decent dating TV show.

I sat down to watch this TV program on Netflix with my wonderful wife and within seconds we knew it was a dog. The show just consists of these wild disconnected scenes lasting 2-3 seconds just jumping back and forth between scenes that aren't related to anything. Now I get that we live in an ADD society and thinking coherently is not a good thing, but OMFG this show takes it too far. It just presents gibberish of all these cut scenes and all the women are going crazy over one guy whom we know nothing about and doesn't seem very likable to begin with. He just stands around smirking at women as if he's God's Gift to All Women, and of course they all fall all over him, yet we just see once super-short cut scene after another, and nothing makes any sense.

It would be a thousand times better if they just let this super-lucky guy whom Netflix adores for some reason just date each woman so we can see what he's like or not like and what the people actually do or say.

Horrible waste of time and production. For the cost put into this, we could have had ten better dating shows with real people you might care something about."
Dating Around,HOLY CRINGE!!!,"Oh my god, I normally don't write reviews but this is the cringiest show I've ever seen in my life. If you're a fan of dying inside from sheer cringe then you might enjoy it but otherwise just be ready to feel incredibly awkward for other people!!! Holy crow!"

Dating Around,A Crying Shame,"The first season was great and filled with interesting daters. The dates were so genuine that I often felt like a fly in the wall. It is truly unfortunate how this show totally lost my interest with the introduction of Season 2. I'm a lover of reality T.V., but not when it's contrived, scripted, and totally fake. I hope they will bring back the format of the first season; otherwise, I will no longer be watching."
Dating Around,Exceptionally edited,"This show isn't fake. People are just not aware that editing exists. The leads are wearing the same outfit as they go on one date each night to give the illusion they are dating back-to-back. I wish people didn't give this show a 1/10 just because they are not knowledgeable enough about cinema.

As much as I am a big movie critic in my circle of friends, I rarely review anything online. I had to drop a review after seeing it was underrated. This is the best dating reality series I've seen, and I've been on a kick of watching mostly dating shows so I think I have some insight here.

They chose to never break the fourth wall in this show, ei, the cast doesn't look direct at the camera, or speak to the camera about their experience. I love this. It gives more time to watch the people interact, and I never felt spoon fed information. The editing overall is exceptional.

Very diverse cast. Straight, bisexual, and gay/lesbian people. No race, gender, or sexuality appears favoured, which is extremely refreshing.

They overlap the editing of the conversations in a way that feels cinematic and natural, which is not easy to do. GREAT SHOW."
Dating Around,Another Cooked 'Reality' Show,"It won't matter to people that are into this genre because they don't want anything that's real. They do a good job of making it seem like it's real but it doesn't take long to see that it's very contrived and manufactured. What WOULD make this show good is having a dog shock collar on some of the girls - so that everytime they say 'like'.... SHOCK! It's almost impossible to listen to some of them. Funny enough, the only girl that doesn't sound like this is the Columbian. You can count on people NOT from America to sound like they have a better grasp of speaking the language. And the monotone. The dude in the first episode sounds like he has been drained of all energy. I'm sure this show will do fine because there is an endless audience for fake reality shows."
Dating Around,Needs more reality,"I usually like reality tv that's a little nuanced, and if you're like me, don't watch this show. What this show lacked in originality, however, it made up for in quality of the filming, soundtrack and good storytelling. Unfortunately, the content is incredibly flat, cliché and yawn inducing. I stopped watching only after Episode 3 because everyone in the show is really the same person. Not enough personality for it to be interesting. If they'd chosen more interesting, real people, and not just based it off looks, they'd definitely have a show. But I get the feeling this show is focused on the superficial."

One-Punch Man,Completely Hilarious and Full of Quality,"One Punch Man is one of the funniest and most entertaining anime series I've ever watched in my entire life. Even though it is a newly started anime, the first episode was highly anticipated throughout the anime community, and it was definitely golden in my eyes, with high quality animations and a hilarious story line. The main character, his enemies and the life he lives is a complete mockery of other popular anime plots, both from recent and present anime's. The lines and the dialogs in the episodes are full of puns and jokes, with a satiric sense of comedy injected into them. I highly recommend that you watch this anime, as it will definitely at least bring a smile to your face, and you won't regret the time you spent to watch it."
One-Punch Man,Interesting Plot. Likable Characters. Amazing Animation!,"One Punch Man follows a hero that can end all of his fights with one punch, and that makes him so frustrated. Now you might be thinking, what's so interesting about that? Don't you want to see the hero struggling to kill his enemy? Well not this time. Here, you will see a super-overpowered hero struggling to find a stronger enemy, struggling to feel the thrill and adrenaline of the fights he once felt when he was weak. Was his training to become strong not worth it after all?

This anime is so random so the plot is unpredictable, in good ways. The animation and the fight scenes are SUPERB! It has the best fight scenes I have ever seen in all of the animes I have ever watched. Go ahead and watch it! It will be worth your time."
One-Punch Man,Definitely a must-watch anime,"I didn't know about the anime when its manga existed but many people told me that ""this thing is brilliant you gotta read it"" and I was like ""meh"" and didn't bother much. However, recently I saw that the show is being animated and 6 episodes were released and I just wanted to give it a shot. And I was like.. Boom! Absolutely blown away with the first episode and watched all 6 episodes without a break and I can say this is currently the best anime out there you can watch.

The story is about a bald superhero defeating every bad-ass enemy in his way with a single blow. The animation is spectacular(better than any anime made IMO), the jokes and puns are hilarious, most importantly the plot and pacing of the story is so fast and there are definitely zero windy/exaggerated moments scenes. So, every tiny bit of second you watch has a value and NEVER boring since they packed 22 manga episodes into 6 anime episodes so far. I watched over a hundred anime but this is the first one making me impatiently wait for Sundays. Just go and watch it, NOW!"
One-Punch Man,One Punch Man a must watch,"This anime which has released a few weeks ago is a masterpiece created by renown anime producer, Madhouse. It sat ires classical anime genre making it an extremely hilarious show which will bring many grins to those who have already watch other anime.

Perhaps the most notable accomplishment of this anime so far is the main hero Saitama who through his plain bald appearance makes us rejoice as he reveals tiny fractions of his power against formidable foes. Combine this with an epic soundtrack, amazingly drawn fight scenes and the badassery that it Saitama you get yourself an awesome anime."
One-Punch Man,Absolutely think one punch man is excellent,"Honestly when I first heard of this anime, it was shown as a ""ok"" meme gif on Facebook and made me fall in love with the show as well as its main characters. I like how Saitama is this laid back hero but at the same time, does his best to be badass and save the world. I even like his robot companion Genos, he's also likeable too and actually kind of sweet for a tough ass looking hero himself. As well as that, he cares about Saitama and that really stands out with the show!

Love the humour, the characters and its on going storyline. I'm even looking forward to season 2 and hopefully it's good as its original first season!"
One-Punch Man,A sparkle of sure brilliance,"This series has blown me away within the first 3 episodes, it's hilarious, the action is great, the characters are interesting and not to mention its original design. The main thing that i love about this Anime is the potential it has to be something amazing due to the Manga being so excellently written. Its been a long time since i've seen an Anime that has peaked my interest so much, if you are a fan of Anime you will not be disappointed! Saitama (the main protagonist) is hilarious. Anime seems to have peaked recently due to the standard being set by shows such as Attack on Titan and I believe this show will set a new standard for Animes similar to its genre."
One-Punch Man,One-Punch Dude,"A new perspective in the Japanese Anime. No mainstream characters, not a cliché story or plot, it has a great potential in becoming even better, personally I didn't read the manga(the comic) and in my opinion this anime show is really watchable and I recommend it to everyone no parental advisory, call them even and watch it together.

Saitama is very interesting character you'll never know what he is going to do next or when is he going to punch the opposer.

Don't hesitate and start watch this great show you won't be disappointed, and you'll thank anyone and everyone who made you watch it."
One-Punch Man,First episode and I already love it,"I saw this anime online once and I finally took the time to watch it. Needless to say, the first few episodes are none less than EXCELLENT! It's action packed, funny, has just the right amount of hot people for the classic anime needs. As soon as I watched the first episode I found myself watching all of them and telling all my friends to watch it; it's so amazing, something to be put to the top, next to Death Note or Fullmetal Alchemist, or Dragon Ball Z. Definitely my favorite anime currently. There's not that much to say except that it's definitely a comedy, you'll definitely laugh or have a good chuckle. It is very gory however, not that suitable for younger anime fans. Though if you've watched Neon Genesis Evangelion or Future Diary, this show is most likely in your range of comfort and you'll most likely enjoy this anime as much as I have. Again, great anime so far."
One-Punch Man,Review,"This show is one of the best shows I've seen in the anime section. This is a personal opinion but let me tell you why I have it. This show is different than most mainstream anime, it is unique and funny, it will make you laugh every single episode and you will not get bored of it. Moreover, it brings a different type of storyline plus there are next to no anime clichés. The show is smoothly animated and the voice acting is great, at least in my opinion. I have read the manga (aka the comic) and I know what the whole show is about. There will be many more episodes to come if they plan on following the manga. I would recommend this show to every person of every age. The only reason why I wanted to give it 9/10 initially is because the episodes are pretty short. Besides that, it's amazing, a must watch."
One-Punch Man,Reasons to watch OPM,Comentario no disponible
One-Punch Man,Blown away - Like Saitama the anime itself has no limit's to its awesomeness!,"I am truly tempted to give One punch man a 10 but in my opinion there is no perfection. There is near perfection and one punch man is that.

The first episode that i saw, i laughed so hard that i almost fell off my chair. As it progresses to the next episodes they try to combine the comedic and the seriousness of the story together, and they manage to do that. I feel like that the writers are truly doing this with a feeling of passion and next to it they enjoy the absurd fighting sequences.

Opinion on the last two episodes of season 1:

My thoughts: The amount of awesomeness put in this two episodes is beyond imagination. It's just incredible how they build up the climax to the end and to show the endless powers Saitama has. Although it's a parody it doesn't stop me as a viewer to enjoy the anime and accept it as part of something great. When i say something great, i mean putting it next dragon ball, and other incredible animes. It's obvious to the rational thinker that a lot of elements like the characters design (boros etc) are similar to Dragon ball, and that it's influenced by them.

BUT what makes it so different one might ask himself: Just by observing the amount of details put in to the fighting sequences will tell you that 'one punch man' is a serious anime (in some ways). Dragon ball is nostalgic and has a great history and character development behind its series and one punch man will have to gain more years in order to obtain the status DB has. What i'm trying to say is that the detail put in to the fighting scenes in one punch man are far beyond what other anime have achieved or tried to... It's a masterpiece in way... And that's what gave this anime a 9 out of 10.

He destroys all of his enemies with one punch and mocks them like they were nothing. But it still does not get boring and that's the reason why this anime is a great success. Make the details look sublime and the fighting sequences beyond comprehention, mix it with a flavor of humor/comedy and you've got in my eyes the perfect anime (action fans). Just take a good look at the episode where Saitama fights Genos and you'll get the perfect picture on why this anime is amazing (there are youtube videos with that scene).

It even got me to search some more info about this anime on the internet. There are youtube videos and articles about the origin of one punch man. It's interesting to take a look.

I hope this show keeps up the quality as it is and i can't wait for more! ----> after watching the last two episodes i can only imagine where it is headed. This anime has proved (after this season) that it will not fail to entertain it's anime loving fans!"
One-Punch Man,First Season Is a Masterpiece,Comentario no disponible
One-Punch Man,A must watch !,"A definite must watch title of 2015. I was never into animes but one day my friend came over and after some chilling around he told me about OPM. I was skeptic a lot but I said OK, lets watch it . ( 2 eps were out ) and in no time we finished them and I was left in wanting more of Saitama...

So it saddens me that as of today 21th of December the last episode of the first season released and now we are left with this question: will there be a season 2 ? Murata ( the artist ) said he will do anything in his power to force out a season 2. We are left only to hope.

So take my advice and give it a go !"
One-Punch Man,Epic,One Punch Man has the perfect balance between powerful planet bursting action scenes and a chilled main character that doesn't seem to bother about anything going on. The animation of the first season is top notch the way the images display the impact and speed of the fights is just mind blowing and a must watch for every animation lover. Also there's this great humor and perfect timing that makes One Punch Man almost a parody for so many other Anime shows. When Son Goku's gotta train his butt off to defeat his enemies Saitama is already over this point. He just needs one punch to blow away whatever's standing in his way. This idea is just brilliant to me and works surprisingly well. Watch this show you won't regret it.
One-Punch Man,"Great Anime, But Greater Manga","Personally this is my favorite anime of Fall.

A must watch anime

I can't wait for that ""Prophecy"" fight in the future.

I really hope Madhouse gets to it.

(Update - Yup Madhouse get it right!!! Yes! Yes!Yes!)

Madhouse has done justice to this anime by following 100% from manga..

The fighting is awesome, the art is good and the soundtrack is superb..!!!

For me personally I would say the art was better in manga, however it is understandable since putting it into animation it selves required a lot of workforce.

Great job Madhouse.!!

I am surely gonna get the set of DVD's and Bluray as my collection."

One-Punch Man,Thoughts on the first two seasons,"The first season was excellent, with very great animation and impressive action sequences, being an amusing parody of action anime shows and the superhero genre.

The second season, while not as good as the first, was still very entertaining to watch, even if the plot was a little bit more conventional. (With the addition of the typical ""rival"" character, though there were a couple of interesting aspects in his backstory)

My vote vote for the first season is 9/10.

My vote for the second is 8/10."
One-Punch Man,Best New Show I've Seen This Year,"Last week I didn't know this show even existed and now I am telling all of my friends to watch it. I can't recommend this show enough. I can't say that I watch much anime, as I have only watched 2 anime series (Full Metal Alchemist and Death Note) in my whole life. So when my partner put on One Punch Man for the first time I was not convinced that it would be something I would enjoy. I was delightfully surprised within the first 5 minutes of the first episode. This show is full of dark comedy and satire which makes it really easy to watch. The story is fast paced and doesn't allow much room for filler. The jokes are well constructed and delivered perfectly. Definitely a must watch!"

One-Punch Man,The Awaited Equivalent of the Dragon Ball Z Series,"This is a masterpiece (till episode 09), for a guy who has watched superhero movies his entire life, 90% have the same concept of justice and other ideals however this, this is new. This is different, and this is good. I hope they continue how they are going and not spoil the series. It basically focuses on justice in the modern era, the characters are lovable, especially the protagonist Saitama. The best thing about this character is not that he is overpowered but the fact that he is entirely different and a lot practical superhero. Even in DBZ series the only practical guy I felt was Vegeta and that's why he is my favorite. The pattern of following ideals in superhero movies has not changed much and basically our entertainment focuses on the character, here the entire perspective of justice has changed."
One-Punch Man,Good Comedy but feels like a waste,"Has some funny jokes, but overall feels kind of tragic because the world building we see go on is pointless since everything is a joke. Why should I learn about the threat levels or heroes it's just a joke. If this was more serious I would've loved it because it sets up an awesome world with creative heroes. Have fun with it but just know you're going to be sad thinking about how good this show would be in a more serious setting."
One-Punch Man,"Imagine Deadpool, but manga version","Imagine Deadpool, but manga version. The de facto superhero parody series of this decade. Brilliant, impressive, and hilarious in every respect. For a series all about an overpowered protagonist, it got my heart pumping and emotionally invested. Also, Tatsumaki is a loli goddess."
One-Punch Man,Great,"Based on the manga of the same name created by One, One-Punch Man follows Saitama, a super hero whose incredible strength allows him to defeat all enemies in a single punch. Definitely a farce of the entire anime superhero / fighting genre, the plot lines and humour are superb for what it is, if you're already a fan of these style fighter anime then you should find this quite funny. Netflix is currently carrying the first season, but you'll need Tubi or another service to get the latest season 2 which I just finished up. Unfortunately a new director and animation studio took over for the second season, and while its still quite good, it doesn't near live up to the quality of the first. The first season of One-Punch Man is in my opinion some of the highest quality animation in the last decade, and I could not recommend it more."

DEATH NOTE,"Brilliant first half, and the rest of it was just okay.",Comentario no disponible
DEATH NOTE,Masterpiece but latter half ruined the series slightly,"I will be short, the series is a gem: character buildup, screenwriting, tension, drama, art, cinematography, everything. Truly captivating story...

...until (without spoiling it) the main story arc ends quite anticlimactically and new subplot begins with new characters in the primal focus. The latter half takes away a hint of brilliance from rest of the story.

Still I would recommend it!"
DEATH NOTE,"Clever, Slick, and Suspenseful","This is anime at its best. I'm fairly new to the world of anime, but I have to say from what I've seen that Death Note goes above and beyond your typical run-of-the-mill action based anime. Whereas a lot of anime strategically relies on action packed battles and fights, Death Note is a refreshing change of pace. It's slick, clever, and witty with the eccentric ""L"" heading the investigation. It's a constant game of cat and mouse as the lead investigator and the suspected ""Kira"" or ""Killer"" always seem to be one step ahead of one another. The two brilliant minds constantly outwit each other. The plot is complex but easily laid out for you and the story is remarkably intelligent and inventive. All the while you're watching you think, ""Wow, this can't possibly get any deeper,"" but each new episode proves you wrong. What I like the most is that this is very, very complex material but it's flawlessly and easily presented so each new development in the case comes as an excited shock.

This is great stuff and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be looking for a change of pace in anime. It's not for everyone, of course since it's more of an intellectual thriller and not so much an action fantasy, but anyone who can appreciate the mental challenge of following along with this suspenseful battle of wits will be in heaven with Death Note."
DEATH NOTE,Genius,The first 25 episodes of Death Note are simply insane. The mental fight between L and Yagame Light is something I've never seen before in that intensity. They are both such great characters so if either of them wins you will be sad for the other one. The last 12 episodes were still pretty good but just not at the same level as before. But the ending was really great again and a worthy one.
DEATH NOTE,Rush!,"After watching the first six episodes, I find that the story line is very well though out. Unlike many series, Death Note has a way of keeping ahead of the watcher, and one can never predict what is about to happen.

The series is obviously dark. One of the things that I find interesting about Death Note that the protagonist isn't the good guy, like that of the stereotypical protagonist. The fact that this series goes morally were few others will go is definitely one of the reasons I find this series to be so enticing.

I'm definitely hooked!"
DEATH NOTE,The second half of the series ruined a masterpiece,Comentario no disponible
DEATH NOTE,My goodness,This is good. I don't watch anime. I watched all of this. It is very good.
DEATH NOTE,let them eat cake!,"From the pages of the manga to the silver screen and then to the small screen. Manga = breathtaking, Film = groundbreaking, Anime = phenomenal.

Death Note the anime is one of the best animes to come out for a very long time. The storyline is amazing but not complicated or cliché. Like the film and manga, it depicts the cat and mouse hunt between L and Light on who will uncover one another's identity.

Death Note is a cake; everything good about a cake; and therefore people should see this landmark. Overall, Death Note will remain a classic forever... if the Americans don't remake and ruin it!!!

DEATH NOTE,This show is Wonderful!,"This show just keeps getting better and better! Every episode has a new twist, and is never the same as the last! It will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you will watch it again and again! The story is centered around a young man, Yagami Raito/Light who finds a ""Death Note"". I won't tell you anymore about this ""Death Note"" (as that would spoil it). With this ""Death Note"" he sets about ridding the world of evil and creating a ""Utopia"", with himself as the new god. Filled with interesting characters, lots of intelligent dialouge and exiting plot twists, this show is definitely on my top 10! I would Highly recommend it to anyone, those who enjoy crime/psychological/dark themes."
DEATH NOTE,Incredible until it Wasn't,"Death Note was a stellar TV Show and on its way to being one of my favorite animated TV Shows. With its incredible concept, interesting villainous protagonists and an antithesis to the protagonist that complimented his genius perfectly. The formula was great with the exception of episodes 18-22 which features our protagonists cunning on a boring way that leads to a lackluster payoff. After this however. Episodes 23, 24 and 25 are phenomenal works of art. This is where the series goes from Incredible to incredibly mediocre. With the exception of the last 3 episodes of the show, there is no right for any of the episodes after episode 25 to exist. The show went from having me completely invested to it feeling like a chore to finish, which is a shame because of how great the last 3 episodes actually were. They introduce new antagonists that are literally the exact same thing as the last one we had, except much worse and no fun at all to watch. I was frustrated with these new characters and their placement in the show. In my opinion Death Note should have ended at episode 25 then it would have been a nearly perfect anime."
DEATH NOTE,"Starts out very strong, but....",Comentario no disponible
DEATH NOTE,Two thumbs up!,"This manga is exceptional: smart, captivating and suspenseful. The script is up to the drawings: astonishing and entertaining. I loved it!"
DEATH NOTE,Started out well but then staggered,"I am glad to see that despite the average of 9.0 from numerous voters... there are still many people here who can look at this anime series from an objective point of view and openly state its flaws.

No need for me to go into details or spoilers at all. I've seen about every Death Note there is to see (aside from the 2017 American series which I refuse to watch just on principle). Like many here I understand the Death Note concept and found the original move to be a masterpiece.

But this anime... it was like packing a 2 hour movie into a 14 hour slow-motion treadmill. As pointed out by several others-- plot concepts were repeated, concepts thrown in and then ignored, and by the 20th episode I was feeling like Ryuk... bored bored bored. Although well-presented, this felt like nothing more than someone trying to drag out the original story lines to as many episodes as they could possibly milk. But the cow ran dry long before the series ended.

Filled with gaping plot holes, lack of logic, areas of ridiculous complexity and jump-the-shark ""logic""... this felt like an old Charlie Chan movie mystery where one person says ""I have won because"" and the other person says ""Except I foresaw that and"" and then the first person says ""But I knew you foresaw it so I"" and then the second person... well, you get the idea. Savvy viewers can only handle so much of that stuff before they start thinking ""seriously?"".

The gore in the very final episode was unprecedented in the series, gratuitous and totally unnecessary to ending the story. There was a strong feeling of anti-climax pretty much through the entire last half of the series (if not before). I started questioning where they were going somewhere after the 10th episode. At the 20th episode I was asking ""how long are they going to drag this on?"". By the time we got to episode 30 I had given up all hope and watched the rest on sheer ""closure"" factor-- let's get this watched and over with.

One major mistake in production which I don't understand (probably had something to do with legal rights) was the change in the theme song about halfway through. They went from a barely-tolerable beginning and end song to a total-trash, super-heavy-metal theme song that sounded like it came out of some stoner's garage band. If the purpose of that ""music"" was to convince us there are insane people in the world... it was a total success. I like just about all kinds of music, but that second theme song was a loser in both concept and performance and did nothing to support the series. It turned Death Note into Dead Note and was a terrible choice for theme music.

One scene especially (no spoilers) where someone was going to murder two people in cold blood to eliminate Kira-- all I can say is the writers must have been smoking weed when they came up with that lame concept. That didn't make any sense from any viewpoint, and certainly was not Death Note. They had a shark jump the shark on that one.

In the end the series was way too long, too contrived in plot, and had too many unbelievable points and logic flaws to stand up to examination. No matter how much someone may have enjoyed the original Death Note movie, if viewed honestly this anime just doesn't stand up to the standards of good anime or the Death Note concept either one. I'm a great fan of the original 2006 movie... but I was yawning 2/3 of the way through this series. The story line was forced and mediocre at best. As I've stated with a couple of other Death Note wannabe's... we don't need yet another Death Note; the original was just fine."
DEATH NOTE,A Captivating and Unique Anime,"I have seen many anime but few compare to Death Note. It provides it's viewers with incredible characters, a deep storyline, and view of how power can corrupt. The focus of the story is on Yagami Light, a college student who is feed-up with what he considers a rotting world. He soon finds a notebook named ""Death Note."" The instructions state that any human whose name is written in the Death Note will die as long as the person who writes the victim's name has the victim's face in mind at that time. While Light considers it to be a foolish prank, his curiosity gets the best of him. Upon learning that the Death Note is real, Light realizes he has the chance to rid the world of crime and create a new world over which he reigns supreme. The story of Death Note follows Light as he tries to create his new world, and the forces that try to stop him. Perhaps one of the most interesting elements of the series is that the main character is neither a hero or an anti-hero but instead an anti-villain. This an excellent series that is guaranteed to leave viewers in awe."
DEATH NOTE,"Brilliant start, weak finish, but still great show","No spoilers... This show has a great starting foothold. The mixing between mythical fantasy world of god of death and police detective story line is brilliant, just works brilliantly. But as the story grows the details on how things work out gets blurry and un logical character decision making happens more and more often But overall very enjoyable despite the weak finish, and oddly i am hoping there is a death note 2"
DEATH NOTE,"Well Written, Masterful Anime","I have to say two things turned me off. First is the idiot reviewer on the front page who feels the need to use 70% of his review(even titled it ""Eat Your Heart Out Naruto""-really subtle) to bash Naruto like some insecure 12 year old spoiled brat fan boy. Pathetic. The second was that it sounded like some Gothic action anime from others. However when I finally saw it I thought, meh, okay. However as it went on I got more and more drawn in.

The plot is simple enough to start:successful and brilliant student Light stumbles upon the Death Note, which will kill anyone who's name he writes down provided it's their real name and he knows his face. He experiments with it and sees that it's real. He plays with the other rules all the while killing other criminals and meeting up with the shinigami who wrote the death note. The deaths of these criminals does not go unnoticed as the renound and mysterious detective El is trying to discover who Light, under the name Kira, is. Whoever finds the other's identity first will win in this power struggle.

Like I said, the first episode is interesting enough. The story however develops and becomes better and more complex as it goes on. The moral ambiguity of the anime gives it a unique feel among others of it's kind. I was shocked to see a show like this under Shounen jump which usually host anime that combine strong actions scenes with a complex plot and character development. What we have here instead is an anime that dosen't have adrenaline pumping action scenes advancing the plot(not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact I enjoy that as well) but the proverbial chess game between Light and the police as Light becomes well aware the police are after him as he does everything possible to hide himself all the while continuing to do away with criminals at his whim.

Ryuk, the shinigami who follows Light, actually provies some of the comic relief of the show believe it or not. He's not over the top goofy by any means however if there's any laughs to be derived, it's usually from him.

Even if you're not a fan of Shounen Jump anime, you should give Death Note a try. It easily rivals the majority of thriller films. It is well worth your time."
DEATH NOTE,"A must see for anyone, don't even need too like anime to love this!!!","I watched one episode and thought the first episode wasn't pretty good, but when i started too watch(watching episode 11 now) i started too love it, its genius and the guy who made this movie got too be one of the smartest filmmaker ever, The animation is one of the best, the story is smart, deep and exemplary written , the characters are interesting, i can gladly say i haven't found one error in this series, so even if you don't watch much anime i just recommend you too watch this and i can swear that you will like it, i think this is as good as elfen lied(or even better). The story is about a guy named light who is top-student and smartest guy in school(without being a geek), one day some kind of diary named ''death note'' falls down from the sky and he picks it up, and then the story begins.. a must see for everyone!!!

DEATH NOTE,"The L saga is superb, the ending half weak",Comentario no disponible
DEATH NOTE,I am Justice.,"In the first episode, you can already see the amazing animation, the well-chosen voices, the immediate gripping of fear over the future in your chest. Death Note is a must-see for those who love to have a good 5 minutes of thinking because Death Note beautifully weaves suspense and unexpected turn of events that leaves the audience stunned and fascinated.

You'll notice the good production, but to truly decide whether it's worth watching you will have to watch to the 2nd (and for those who are stubborn, the 3rd) episode. If you are planning to watch this for a limited of time, you're in luck because the series is only 37 episodes long since the manga already ended.

While the IQ of the two main characters is straight-out impossible, you still cannot feel but admire just how logical their reasons for making possibilities and theories are (what makes it even scarier is that most of the theories that L or Light, the two protagonists, are true). If you are one who watches things from a personal view, you would have a hard time deciding whether the things they are doing are right and if they are, in reality, insane.

There is slight humor that adds faint scratches on the anime, but it is soon covered up in the next minute with what a character has done or said. There was not a moment where I wasn't sitting at the edge of my seat, my eyes literally sticking to the screen. Every minute is worth watching, even the sinister theme songs played by Nightmare.

What makes this anime/manga unique is that it's a mystery thriller where you hardly question the origins of something. You rarely ask yourself unanswerable questions (not even in the back of your mind) and without realizing, you're only focused on the present events.

I promise, no matter what kind of audience you are, you will be gripped by this chilling life and death chain of events of a bored genius who kills criminals mercilessly with the mysterious Death Note."
DEATH NOTE,Wow,Comentario no disponible
DEATH NOTE,Simply Phenomenal!,"Despite the fact that I haven't read the manga, I can say that Death Note is one of the best anime I've ever seen. The story & characters amazing and complex. It's a classic cat & mouse game between the hero and the villain on who try to find out about the others' identity. The animation is amazing, which is that you can always expect from japan. Overall, Death Note is a classic anime that is beloved by many and will continue to remain beloved for many years to come."
DEATH NOTE,The first half was good... What happened?,"The series starts off great. There are around 5 excellently developed characters; there's a great premise; the plot develops logically and compellingly; the pacing of building tension then action is spot on. You've got a unique feel, and some moral dilemma action thought-provoking action. Everything has a balanced and cohesive feel - pretty much everything you'd expect when you see a series rated 8.9.

*I have to warn a very slight plot spoil, but I won't give anything remotely specific.*

Then about halfway through the series, to solve some stagnation they throw in a good dose of anticlimax. Now the majority of the interesting characters stop getting any screen time for various reasons and follow up by introducing and then disposing of characters you never have any reason to care about. The very ending was well done. (Pity it wouldn't make sense if you just skipped the 15 episodes preceding it!)

Maybe the manga developed all of the lame characters in the second half and had I first read all of them I would have enjoyed it all, but still... I just can't justify how sloppy everything got. Compare with either of the Fullmetal Alchemist adaptations, or Code Geass if you can tolerate mecha action, and you'll see where I'm coming from.

It either needed to be around 20-25 episodes and finish off strong without all of the later stuff, of have been extended to at least 50 so that they could have developed the last half into something workable."
DEATH NOTE,Entertaining until a certain point,"I just watched all the 37 episodes after some friends recommended the series. I am not sure why I watched them all, to be honest. Really unlikable characters, same things happening over and over again, with some rare twists that are not even that brilliant. I am completely ignorant of the anime world, and this might be considered good. But it never happened to me to be so utterly indifferent about the main characters (especially after the time jump). So watch it if you really don't have anything better to do, or if you really like egocentric and self-loving, arrogant, overbearing, presumptuous characters who try to defeat ""mistrerious"" and brooding ones by ""manipulating"" an army of weak and stupid (by the main character's own definition) ones."
DEATH NOTE,BEST IN THE WORLD!!!!!!,"Honestly, I'm not a regular anime viewer but I rather consider this show as live action due to its realistic nature and I really love it from core of my heart. Just♥ it"
Fireman Sam,Basically two series with completely different quality,"Fireman Sam is a two-sided affair. On the one hand, because the first 4 seasons are a long way from the later ones, but above all because the switch from stop-motion to CGI animations has given the series an extreme kink. In addition, the stories are designed to be more superficial and less value-oriented. So you can rate the first seasons with a very good 9 stars, the later with a lucky 3 stars, so that in the end (unfortunately) an overall rating of 6 points comes out; and that's still benevolent, because the CGI era is much more extensive than that of classic stop motion."
Fireman Sam,Good for little kids who love firefighters,"I watched most episodes of this show with my son when he was 3 and 4 years old. While I loved the earlier stop motion version of Fireman Sam, my son roundly rejected it, instead preferring the shiny computer animated episodes. I think the computer animation lacks a little soul, but my son loved them.

My son was very interested in firefighting, and this is one of the few shows for little kids on the topic. So he loved watching it. The show was fairly entertaining for me.

Norman Price is the world's worst role model for a little kid. That said, he's so awful that my kids mostly griped about what an awful kid he is. That gave us a good starting point to talk about behavior."
Fireman Sam,Great Fires of London! Even Sam himself isn't able to save the day from his show's seasonal rot.,"Previously, the show had likeable characters, good animation, and good episodes. But the CGI series/seasons are just plain awful and one of the worst children's cartoons, Note: I will only be reviewing the CGI series/seasons.

For example, now Dilys (Norman's mother) has been completely redesigned! She looks almost nothing like her original design!

The only connections to previous seasons are: the names of the characters, the show still being set in Pontypandy (albeit with a different layout), the theme music, some of the character designs bearing a slight resemblance to how they looked in Season 5, and Sam still using his ""Great Fires of London"" !"" catchphrase in seasons 6 and 7, but that's pretty much it.

This tries very hard to modernize Fireman Sam/Sam Tân.

CGI animation looks jagged, robotic, weird, scary, ugly, outdated, weak, etc.

Animation errors exist in these seasons as well, like in the episode ""Floating Cart"" where Norman, Mike, Helen and their van disappear for a very short time, but still. This has been fixed (at least in the US version) Another example is in the episode ""Sticky Situation"", where right at the beginning of the episode, you can see a literal red line (probably used to make the animation) on the right side of the screen. How did no one in the animation department notice this until James A Williams did?!

Also, many characters have had their personalities switched.

Norman Price is the worst example, and the only one I'm going to give, he has become annoying, selfish, idiotic, whiny, obnoxious, obnoxious, stupid, bratty, and arrogant who does horrible things for little reason.

The voice acting is sometimes painful to listen to.

For example, children (UK only) sound terrible, as they don't sound like children, but like adults with high-pitched voices.

The worst example is Norman Price, as Steve Kymann does a terrible job voicing him, and his voice in the UK is just unbearable, as it sounds like a cross between Carl Wheezer and JarJar Binks, with a Welsh accent.

I could say a lot more, but I think this quote says it all: ""And I can easily agree that CGI Fireman Sam is definitely one of those bad reboots! Why do I call this a reboot instead of just Season 6 onwards? Because Season 6 seriously feels like I'm watching a completely different show! The characters look and act different, the setting is different, the animation is different, the feel is different. One of the best things about Season 5 was because even though it was made a few years after the original series ended, that season felt like a sequel season to the show. Kind of like Samurai Jack Season 5. The characters were the same, the setting was the same, the humor was the same, and some elements from the original seasons were present in this season. But Season 6 has basically nothing connected to the fifth season, or the other four seasons, except for, Sam's catchphrase of ""Great Fires of London!"", the characters' names and theme song. That's basically it!""


Once he TIED JAMES TO A CHAIR AND GLUED A DOOR SO POOR JAMES WAS STUCK IN THERE!

It doesn't help that he spends a lot of screen time in many episodes of these seasons, even when he's not the main focus. The writers seem to have the motto: ""When in doubt, always put Norman into the scene"""
Fireman Sam,Nice little show for the kids (and parents),"This is a fun little show we discovered on our Comcast ""On Demand"" feature. It concerns the adventures of a team of firefighters in a small town in Wales. Fireman Sam is the main character, with several other folks in town contributing. One thing we appreciate about it is that it is not ""diluted"" for US audiences - the dialog contains several UK/Welsh specific phrases and terms, which my 6 year old son has had fun hearing, while learning how another culture expresses itself. The characterizations are standard but well-drawn; the firefighters are not superheroes, just brave and steady. There is the naughty boy who gets in scrapes and the average town folk who sometimes require the fire service. A good show for youngsters to view with characters they can understand, and very family-friendly without being sappy."

Fireman Sam,Good for kids.,"Despite the poor animation and poor performance of the actors, I thought it was good for kids and I have good memories of when I was a kid and I saw this series. I recommend."
Fireman Sam,Awful,"This show, at least the modern CG seasons are pure garbage. Fires randomly start that wouldn't. People do the dumbest things. The voice acting is... not even acting; it's grown men trying to be kids-any other show would use boys or women. The scripts are terrible, the ""animation"" is atrocious. The plots are thin. It's annoying to watch for anyone with half a brain. Yes, it's a kid's show, but parents often end up watching the same thing as their (young) kids.

If I had a choice, I'd remove this from Netflix. But I can't and my 2yo loves fire trucks... I can only hope the poor quality is temporary."
Fireman Sam,One of the best kids-oriented shows ever!,"When we were in primary school, Fireman Sam was something that my siblings and I used to watch without fail every day. At 18 I remember it with such fondness. It looked wonderful, was funny, educational and adventurous. I often laughed at Norman's naughty antics, and often sang along with the irresistibly catchy theme song. I marvelled at how the characters looked, the construction of the village PontyPandy itself and how colourful it was. I loved the fun and creativity of the stories, while they taught us very important things without it being forced down our throats. And the characters are endearing, Sam, Norman, Elvis, Penny, Basil and Norman's mum all to name a few.Plus John Alderton was perfect with the narration and voices. Overall, a great show! 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Fireman Sam,Terrible!!,This show is terrible! The same whiny kid Norman seems to start every fire and never learns his lesson. And the Elvis character is such a stupid fire fighter. Netflix needs to remove the show!

Fireman Sam,Garbage,Why haven't they employed kids to do the kids voices. So very annoying.
Fireman Sam,A funny show to teach kids about fire safety,"I can remember first seeing this stop-motion animated kids' programme when I was very young, probably shortly before or after its demise. Like most other shows I can remember from my childhood, I liked this one a lot. I can also recall still watching reruns of it several years later. It has been over a decade since then, but I remember accidentally coming across the show on TV once a few years ago, and even if that hadn't happened, I would still remember it very well!

Fireman Sam was a firefighter who lived in Pontypandy, a town in Wales. Other main characters in the show included Sam's fellow firefighters (Station Officer Basil Steele, Penny Morris, Trevor Evans, and Elvis Cridlington) along with several other townspeople. He was a hero to the town, and certain people in the community often needed the help of Sam and the other firefighters, whether it was for a fire or something else, including Norman, a mischievous kid who often found himself in trouble due to his lack of self-control.

""Fireman Sam"" was an educational programme which could teach kids about safety. To make it entertaining as well, the show was also rich with adventure and humour. A lot of the laughs came from Norman's mischievous ways. Another highlight was the very catchy theme song. For all those reasons, the show is very memorable, and I'm sure many kids today could enjoy it just as much as those who watched while they were kids in the '80s or '90s! I'm sure there are still reruns of the show played, so it's not one of those kids' shows that have been forgotten, fortunately."
Fireman Sam,"Kids like it, I found it a little harder","This programme has a lot of nice elements. The dreamy village setting is nice, the messages of guidance are clear and the story lines easy to follow. Our young children like it a lot. Which means I end up watching it a lot, too :-) If I could, I'd change a few things. The utter hero-worship of Sam, modest though he is, is too much; the kids always end up wanting to be him. Also, he's a rescue service of every kind, if a fuse went in the telly they'd ""ring Fireman Sam"". But toughest is Norman's harshly horrible voice which is the most unpleasant kid's voice you've ever know mixed with the most OTT caricature of Welsh.

None of these things are crimes and the good of the show very much outweighs the bad. It's just when you've watched twenty or thirty of them in a summer, they start to grate just a tiny bit...!"

Fireman Sam,Annoying,"Little boy Normans voice in the animated show makes me want to fill my ears with cement and smash my tv, unwatchable because of it."
Fireman Sam,A Welsh institution,"Another childhood classic that I grew up with, and still watch to this day, my life would never have been complete without Fireman Sam. The theme song is a real gem and well suited for an action-oriented children's program. A round of applause for Ben Henegan and Ian Lawson for the composition, Robin Lyons for the lyrics and Mal Pope for the vocals.

There are also so many likable characters (even naughty Norman Price), that I can't think of one I dislike, not to mention episodes (from the classic series, anyway). And we have to give the narrator John Alderton a pat on the back for managing to provide the right voice for a certain character.

I also approve of Series 5, for its inclusion of female voice actors, uprated Rescue Theme, and improved stop motion animation techniques (that's far from saying that the animation in the Classic Series is bad, which it isn't). And although the writing isn't quite as solid as it is in the Classic Series, it's still quite good. Series 5 is also proof of how a reboot of a classic TV show should be and should've stayed that way instead of going CGI. Wasted potential, if you ask me."
Fireman Sam,34 years?,"It's too kiddie and slow. It's nothing new.

Verdict: fire these animators."
Fireman Sam,One of the best shows ever!!,I remember this show from my countless hours of viewing in the early 90's (probably aged no more than 4 at the time). I saw it again recently and it brought back such memories...this show is an absolute classic. The theme song alone is great.If you liked postman pat or something like that then you'll love this.
Fireman Sam,Awful show..,"The modern English version of Fireman Sam is a terrible rendition of the classic animated kids show. The series promotes nothing about teamwork with Sam been the only hero in every single episode (who is on duty 24/7) with the other fireman just used as comic relief or sidekicks in a ridiculously over-funded small country town fire department. The voice overs are terrible, the awful Normal Price is highly irritating and all the kids sound like adults doing bad impersonations. Over 90% of the town's fire problems would be solved if they just let Norman die... Also the kids constantly get away with doing highly dangerous or downright stupid stunts with just a minor lecture from Sam at the end and a silly promise not to do it again."
Fireman Sam,Pretty solid,The firefighting scenes are not overly realistic. This drama is more character driven
Fireman Sam,Moraliserende,"I think it is stupid that it is always the children who do things wrong and must be told off and ashamed. And of course it is always the firemen who are the heroes, except for Elvis. It is boring to watch somebody making mistakes and beeing corrected."
Fireman Sam,Both the stop-motion and CGI series are great!,"I love Fireman Sam so much! It is one of the best British children's shows in the world because it has a very catchy theme song, nice stories with lots of details, good voice acting, and great characters. I know people say that these traits are gone in the CGI series of the show, but I don't think so. Yes in the CGI series, some of the characters' voices sound annoying and Norman Price is an arsonist, but those traits were changed back in season 13. Since in that season, Norman is nicer and less troublesome, and there are now characters that have GOOD voices. So yeah it's a great show, and I love it!!!!"
Fireman Sam,"Nah, new episodes not good","My kids are watching those old episodes (nineties), new episode not puppet like one they're not interested in, the new edition of Fireman Sam they don't even want to watch!"
Fireman Sam,Ruined by Netflix,Was a pretty decent show for kids for a number of seasons. The new version shown on Netflix is absolute garbage for no other reason than the voices. What happened? Are there only two voice actors left for the entire show?
The Naked Director,,
Shadow and Bone,Sun Summoner's Slothful Storyline,"This series really runs the gamut on storyline and acting quality. Not a lot of shows out there that are this hit and miss.

The Crow gang is fantastic and Netflix really should do a spin-off with just them (or make the show about them). The characters are interesting and the actor who plays Kaz is fantastic.

Meanwhile the main storyline with the Sun Summoner is dull and her love interests are frustrating to watch on screen. It's really hard to stay invested when the main character is unlikable.

But no matter, the Crow storyline makes up for it and I've enjoyed both seasons one and two. Here's hoping for more."
Shadow and Bone,"Season 1 was really good, season 2 okay",I really enjoyed season 1 but season 2 was just a bit too messy with too many characters and too much plot! While that sounds good it was actually a bit confusing as to who was who and what the different story and character arcs were. By far the best thing about the show were the Crows and I do hope they get a spin off series to themselves. They were the most interesting characters with the best dynamics. Other than the Crows the actors in the rest of the show were fine but they - alongside their story arc - felt a bit generic fantasy and I must admit to getting a bit bored. All that said it's a fun watch overall and I hope that there is a season 3 to conclude the shadow & bone part of the show and I 100% hope that there is a Crows spin off with Kaz and his crew.
Shadow and Bone,Pretty Good,"I actually enjoyed Shadow and Bone more than I thought I would. It's definitely one of the better fantasy shows to come out in the last few years. While it's not the best, it's up there! I never read any of the books so I didn't know what to expect but have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It has a little of something for everyone...fantasy, humor, action, drama, romance, etc. While it does take a few episodes to really get going, stay with it because it's worth it! I just finished season two and thought it was good enough to warrant another season. Especially with that cliffhanger at the end. If you like fantasy then give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed!"
Shadow and Bone,"If they don't get another season, I'll be distraught!","One of the best fantasy television shows I've seen in a while. They did a great job of developing the side characters and building up the larger political dynamics at play, while also giving time to the main characters and their relationships."

Shadow and Bone,Solid Fantasy Series!,"Shadow and Bone is a solid, interesting fantasy series that will keep you entertained throughout each episode. While it's not the best fantasy shows to come out in the last few years, it's still a very good one that's worth your to time to watch. I never read any of the books so I didn't know what to expect but have to say I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I've read that it is a good adaptation so even the book lovers should mostly be happy. It has a little of something for everyone...fantasy, humor, action, drama, romance, etc. While it does take a few episodes to really get going, stay with it because it's worth it! The pacing really picks up once they build their world and characters. If you like fantasy then give this show a chance, you won't be disappointed!"
Shadow and Bone,Season 1 yes Season 2 no,"I LOVED the first season. It was pretty similar to the books it just combined two of the book series. Shadow and Bone and the Crows. It even made me buy and read the books. Season two took a turn the last few episodes. Without warning they changed the ending for a clear attempt at continuing the Netflix series. Making a certain character evil. And decreasing the value of several others. Disappointed in the outcome. Yet another string of disappointments for Fantasy genre. I feel like studio involvement got in way. It has been a little while but I remember certain characters dying, or dying in certain ways that they didn't."
Shadow and Bone,A disappointing season 2,"Loved the first season. Waited patiently for the second season... all for almost nothing. There seems to be something lacking especially in the Darkling and Sun Summoner's storyline. I don't find these two characters engaging anymore. The corny script (or maybe taken verbatim from the book? I don't know) does not help either. I had to literally hit the pause button and distract myself with other stuff to rid myself of the second hand embarrassment after listening to such cheesy lines. The Crows on the other hand, well, I just can't get enough of them! Freddy Carter is such a joy to watch. He is the only motivating factor to finish watching season 2."

Shadow and Bone,Great fantasy,"Fantasy shows on netflix is hit or miss, their biggest hit for me being The Witcher, this one comes in at a close second. It seems that they shelled out just as much of a budget for this show as much as TW. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top notch. I find it interesting that the setting is like a fantasy world version of Russia. Plus gun battles and magic is not something I've seen in a fantasy show or movie before. The actors all do a great job as well, most of which are unknown to be except for Ben Barnes. I have not read the books but according to some other reviews the show is a good adaptation of them when usually their are massive changes. So if you are looking for a fun well made fantasy series this one is worth watching. I've watched half of the season so far and I'm trying not to watch the whole thing today but I'm hooked!.

Edit: ok I couldnt help myself, I watched the entire season cuz I think it was that good. However I have one complaint, at times the show is so dark you cant see what is happening, especially in the season finale battle scene. I'm talking Game Of Thrones battle of Winterfell dark, hence the 9. Other than that this is just as good as Witcher and Stranger Things, another success for netflix. Damn it I'm gonna have to read the books now, Please make a season 2!"
Shadow and Bone,So Disappointed in Season 2,Comentario no disponible
Shadow and Bone,"Season 1 yay, season 2 boooo","Well that was annoying.

I really enjoyed the first season, but half way through the second season it all went wrong.

So season 1 had solid screenplay, writing, acting, effects and felt like a great dark fantasy adventure.

Little bits of wit and humour woven in here and there resulted in a well balanced introduction into the backstory, characters and entire premise of the world.

Then along comes season 2.

It's continues pretty much as good as the first and all is good, but... about halfway through the season there's a really weird but clear shift.

All of a sudden it becomes incredibly cheesy, poorly acted, over theatrical, effects somehow get noticeably poorer and overall results in it becoming not very interesting at all.

It's almost as if someone else took over but with half the budget.

By the end of it, I had zero interest in the plot or the characters and just wanted it to hurry up and end.

Season 1 gets a solid 7, but season 2 drags it down to a 5."

Shadow and Bone,So good that it makes a non reader want to to read,Special affects are great. Story is a little slow in the beginning but ends up being well worth it! Makes me want to go buy the books because I want to know what happens next!!
Shadow and Bone,I actually watched the complete 1st season!,"Not so much because of a tight plot that always made sense, but because the casting was really done, with engaging characters, with even some character development. This is the first Netflix fantasy in a long while I've found worth watching- most have been somewhere between horrid and utterly ridiculous. This YA offering does lapse into predictabllity at times, but the actors save it, with very fine direction. Don't look for deep and profound here- just sit back and enjoy, mostly, the ride."
Shadow and Bone,Nicely produced nicely acted a nice change,"I was very pleasantly surprised so much so I binge watched the whole 8 episodes.

The story is quite unique that in itself is a bonus as I am so bored of the numerous pathetic attempts of supernatural based sci-fi that don't try to be different This is different in a very good way I am not familiar with most of the cast but found the acting very good So a good start and I hope season 2 is of the same quality."
Shadow and Bone,Wasted potential...,"I was very disappointed by this offering.

It was all over the place trying to tell multiple stories at once and failing miserably. What was the purpose?

Predictable to a fault.

The writing and direction wandered, the actors deserved better."
Shadow and Bone,From a watcher who didn't read the books,"It's still fantastic, and it makes me wish I'd read them! I usually read a book series before watching the adaptations, but I just found this on Netflix. I did a little research to fill in the holes I may have missed, and I'm sure having read the entire book series would enhance your viewing, but you can definitely watch and enjoy without having done so. It's a beautifully well done series, and the acting is superb (Ben Barnes is always worth a watch). An intriguing premise and a whole new and creative world, in a sea of fantasy options we have available to watch these days (I just recently got hooked on His Dark Materials and The Witcher as well). It won't disappoint, when if you are new to the series."
Shadow and Bone,A Good Watch With Potential,"Shadow and Bone is a good watch. It'll keep you entertained and the actors and actresses did a good job. The script was sometimes a bit dull, as was some of the CGI and the costumes. But for me, the show kinda fell apart the same way most fantasy Netflix shows do: pace.

I would have loved a bit more world and character building. With a slower pace this would have been possible. The way they did it was neither a super fast action pace to keep you at the edge of your seat, nor was it a slowly building story where you could get invested into all the characters.

Also most characters that appeared really weren't that relevant to the plot. Especially the Crows and Nina/Matthias. They were entertaining but there was so much else going on, that these 'fillers' wouldn't have been needed. The Crows did bring a lot of humor into the show and I loved the casting there, but still, I felt like it would have been better to hold their storylines back for the first season and only explore the world we find ourselves in and properly develop the three main characters of Alina, Mal and the Darkling.

I think if we'd have gotten more time with the characters, the actors/actresses could have really showed all their potential and the world could have been much richer. This would have meant to put a bigger part of the plot into the following seasons, but I would've been fine with that. I'm aware that that might not be everyones cup of tea, but I'm a sucker for character study and deep and emotional storylines.

The show has potential and as I mentioned earlier, it is very enjoyable. Just don't imagine a second GoT (earlier seasons) or Harry Potter. For me, Shadow and Bone is really more a stand alone new fantasy that will certainly mostly attract a younger audience but is binge worthy for all ages."
Shadow and Bone,Engaging and Gorgeous,"I usually avoid these Fantasy shows but I was planning to test 4k and HDR and I just couldn't turn it off to go watch my usual crime dramas.

Just my kind of pacing and non-linear storytelling.

Mei Lei is so charming and jovial in it without seeming melodramatic despite her situation, hope her character remains that way.

These baddies are quite endearing too, mostly due to the accent, gaits and postures.

But I'd recommend people choose some moderately brighter picture modes if they're using HDR, otherwise it might look too dark.

Hope the remaining episodes don't drag too much and it gets multiple seasons because the casting and cinematography deserves such rewards.

I also wish the book fans don't start hating on it overwhelmingly because I was expecting the usual vile reviews when I logged in here.

Give it a shot."

Lilyhammer,Underrated!,Lilyhammer is such an underrated show. I can't believe that I put off watching this for so long because it's absolutely hilarious! I read all the good reviews and heard good things about it but I still put it off for some reason. If you're like me you keep telling yourself you'll watch it later...don't. You won't regret watching this!
Lilyhammer,It's a fun show,Lilyhammer was so much better than I expected. This series is about a mobster (Steven Van Zandt) who made a deal to inform on his gang therefore has to go on the run so he loves to Norway. Most people know Van Zandt from his time in Sopranos but he quickly makes you care for this character. It's is a fun and warm hearted show that you'll want to binge as quick as possible. It balances both humor and drama as good as any show you'll see like this. It's not a show that you sign up for Netflix just to watch but if you already have then do yourself a favor and go watch it. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a new show to binge.
Lilyhammer,"Truly a great drama, with well served black comedy","After some episodes of ""Lilyhammer"", I really think they have made something original here. Steven Van Zandt is acting like a champ, and carries the show. It's not just a drama, but it also have some funny moments. Van Zandt have some golden comments and bring something Italian-American over to little Norway. Van Zandt as a mobster in ice cold Lillehammer is suitable, and so far this show has surprised me. A lot of good supporting actors here too. Like Fridtjof Såheim and Trond Fausa Aurvaag, both well respected actors in Norway. The level of acting is good overall, with characters that brings the best and worse out of each other. I'm looking forward to the continuation, and I recommend others to see it too."
Lilyhammer,Binge worthy great fun!,"I first watched Lilyhammer during the great covid shutdown of 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed it. But like most people, I binged so many shows then I don't think I gave it enough credit and never reviewed it. I started watching it again today and it's even better the second time around. It's a blend of smart, dark comedy comedy and subtle sarcasm wrapped in beautiful scenery. The characters are very likable and unique and become more complex as the series progresses. Yes, it starts off with a Sopranos vibe, but it's definitely not a mafia show...well, not too much anyway. Not sure why these reviews need to be so long, but just watch a couple episodes, it's great fun!"
Lilyhammer,"Lovely, well made and fun to watch","Great all around.

It's a great mini series. Happening in small town with Lovely twist. Writhing is smart and acting even better. Director has done great job and created smart comedy that is fun to watch and enjoy.

From the cast that has lot common with the The Norsemen, you can only expect something much fun to watch. The creators and the cast shown great job.

This mini series although not for everyone, every age group, for sure is not for low art-understanding crowd.

Highly recommend to watch this mini series although I am not a big fan of series unless they really worth watching.

Great production. Everyone did their job in the best possible way."
Lilyhammer,Amusing crime drama,"I will start with a sentence: it isn't usual American crime drama. Throughout the scenario you will be submerged in Scandinavian culture with their simplicity, beautiful landscapes and people who prefer to keep silent instead of talking things people around already know... and that sounds kinda Sicilian :)

Watched both first series and wow! ... waiting for the next one :)

simply brilliant!

And, yes - I meant ""amusing"" as it is full with original and interesting Norwegian characters and loaded with comedy elements.

Humm, many will say the name of the real town is Lillehammer, but remember that the name of his dog was Lily - and then the picture is complete.

If you are after blood, whores, drugs and uber violence - these TV series are not probably for you - it is all about being what? hey - watch it!"
Lilyhammer,Shame on you Netflix,"It's a damn shame that a show so well written is cancelled for a business decision. Suffice it to say, I laughed, I cried and I'd dispense Lilyhammer justice on anyone whose fault it was to take this charming show off the air. Shame!"
Lilyhammer,"Starts well, tails off in the middle a bit and the less said about the ending the better. Apart from that, Excellent!","Enormously enjoyable series until the last three episodes when the scriptwriters lost the plot (sorry about the pun). As a joint production with the Norwegian government I'm not surprised the Nordies pulled the plug after the last series. The central characters are wonderful but eventually lose the audience's sympathy when the plot lines degenerate into gratuitous filthy language, unfunny violence and rough sex with a dollop of buggery. Not quite the image the clean living Nordies want to project for their tourist industry. A great pity though as its hugely enjoyable until then. As Edmund Blackadder said: 'It started well, tailed off a little in the middle and the less said about the ending the better. Apart from that, Excellent!'"
Lilyhammer,Refreshing and well Written,"I thought this was an amazing series and hope that it continues for a second season. I found it to be very well written and entertaining. I sat and watched all 8 episodes in one sitting because I was hooked within the first 30 min. Good characters, good acting, good story line. Lots of twists and turns but Frank always comes out smelling like a rose. Anybody who has an interest in sopranos or shows like it will enjoy it. Also, over 50 percent of the dialogue is subtitled but don't let that detour you from giving it a chance. Its well worth it.

Steven Van Zandt surprised me in this series. Sure he's doing what he does best as a mafioso character, but its nice to see him on the screen again and handled the lead role very well."
Lilyhammer,"Great idea, but flawed execution","New York Mafioso Frank Tagliano rats out his boss to the FBI and goes in to hiding. He fell in love with the small Norwegian town of Lillehammer after seeing it on TV during the 1994 Winter Olympics and demands to be settled there with a new identity, despite knowing very little about Norway or Norwegian culture. What he faces in Norway turns out to be something entirely different than what he expected, and he quickly moves to use his street knowledge to make the place feel closer to home. Thus the stage is set for a hilarious culture clash when this uncompromising American gangster does what he knows best in a completely naive and gullible town.

This show has been tagged in Norwegian media as a Sopranos set in Norway, owning to the star of the show, Steven Van Zandt, also known as the legendary ""Silvio"" in Sopranos. But to even compare this show to Sopranos is just wrong. If that's what you are expecting you're in for a huge disappointment. This is not Sopranos, and to be fair, it doesn't try to be. Whereas Sopranos was a television epic with intelligent character development and a subtle script, this is a light- hearted comical approach to the Mafia and culture differences. And this is also a part of the show's problem. It tries to be funny, but in many instances it goes too far. Although the show has some exceptionally funny scenes, it's also filled with cheap slapstick humour and some very two-dimensional characters that are there to offer comical relief. The foolishness of these characters is almost on Disney level and it somewhat destroys immersion. The idea is great and the scriptwriters have come up with tons of brilliant ideas for what a New York gangster would find strange in Norwegian society, but for every great scene there is an equally stupid scene.

If the show had been more disciplined with it's search for comical situations, it could have acquired a cult following. Instead you sit back with very mixed feelings. As stated earlier, you are offered a mix of some very intelligent black humour, and some scenes that just make you cringe with embarrassment. None the less, this is an original idea and the entertainment value still makes it worthwhile. Some of the characters are lovable and the general storyline keeps you watching."
Lilyhammer,"Frank Tagliano is a New York Mobster who is relocated to Norway, Lillehammer after giving up his boss to the FBI","(I don't know what the last guy was talking about - this show is laugh out loud funny).

The show starts off pretty fast by Frank Tagliano (Steve Van Zandt) who's a New York Mobster, giving up his boss to the FBI. Within the first 20 minutes of the first episode he's relocated to Norway, more specifically, Lillehammer. This is due to the fact that he saw the Winter Olympics in '94 and decided it was a good place to start a new.

From there Frank has to adapt to Norwegian society which is proving to be quite the challenge. Public works officials like the good folk over at NAV aren't very helpful when it comes to adapting. Frank soon realizes that in order for him to succeed in Norway, he's going to have to resort to his old ways.

The show is funny, very funny. There are some things that seem a little thin, for example how fast he learns to understand Norwegian. Though he doesn't seem to understand a hundred percent of the time what people say (like the review before me implied). Other than that I think everyone who plays a part in this show does a great job. There's no reason why this show would deserve anything beneath a 8/10 rating.

And if you think I'm getting paid to say this: No, I'm not. But I thought the show deserved an honest review, and not a biased one. Give it a chance, I didn't think I'd be very funny but now I'm really looking forward to season two."
Lilyhammer,Great show with peculiarities,"The series is out of the ordinary and hence refreshing. While Steven is double dipping on his Sopranos performance, he is non the less more than welcome in a season two. That's if NRK of Norway and Rubicon decides to produce another season and if Netflix can afford to buy it. Aside from the Norwegian English dialogue with subtitles, which should be OK for most viewers, the dialogue is witty but mostly predictable from Stevens performance. Norwegian actors have their own unique style but that's what makes it worthwhile in addition to the unique scenery. Its not often that one sees anything from Norway on the screen but perhaps the US Norwegian combination can facilitate more worthy productions cross the international border. All in, funny, peculiar and kept me up for 4 evenings in a row."
Lilyhammer,Torgeir is the man!,"I went into the first season hoping for The Sopranos-meets-Norway. I don't know much about Norway, and it's nice to get a glimpse into other countries through productions that feature them as almost a character in themselves (for example, The American). This series did a great job in featuring Norway. However, it was also pretty hokey and featured a protagonist that I did not like.

Frank Tagliano is a narcissistic, hypocritical bully, who pushes his culture and ideas of how the world should be onto everyone in his newly adopted country, stepping on hapless and sometimes innocent Norwegians for selfish gain in stereotypical American imperialist fashion. However, unlike The Sopranos, in which Tony Soprano constantly struggled with his conscience, this show glorifies Frank. I feel like I'm supposed to chuckle as he ""outsmarts"" (more like strong-arms) people into satisfying his every whim.

Fortunately, in the second and third seasons, Frank became a little more judicious and tolerable, while other characters, such as Fausa's Torgeir, flourish. In my opinion, Fausa carries the show. He is charismatic, funny, humble, and tough when he needs to be. He idolizes Frank, even though he is often unrewarded for his unconditional love. Most importantly, he is the conscience of the show, and through him, we are reminded of the price one pays for being or following Frankie the Fixer.

By the way, world, look out for Maria Joana and Ida Elise Broch. You might fall in love."
Lilyhammer,Lilyhammer--where life is not all black and white,"Netflix has scored again with Lilyhammer. This show is primarily a comedy and I find myself laughing out loud during every episode.

Imagine a cross between Al Pacino and Archie Bunker and you have a fair understanding of the main character, Frank Tagliano (Steven Van Zandt)--a mobster who turns state's evidence and goes into the Witness Protection Program in, of all places, Norway. This is a fish-out-of-water story that gives Frank plenty of cultural differences to deal with. He is a guy who leads with his fists inserted into a pacifist environment.

Before he leaves the states, he is warned that if he gets in trouble with the law in Norway, he is on his own. So we know up-front, that this story can go either of two ways. In Lillehammer, Frank deals with an eccentric cast of characters and the viewer never knows which direction the story will take. The series finds humor in the most interesting places.

Much of the humor has an agenda. It takes a playful jab at anti-terrorist paranoia, for example. Bureaucracy is often the target.

The scenery is beautiful. The music is eclectic and very enjoyable. The cast does a good job with the multi-cultural narrative. The dialogue is in both English and Norwegian, but subtitles are used and it is never difficult to understand what is happening.

There are unmistakable reminders of Fargo. And the quirkiness of the locals might remind you of Local Hero (a great film to emulate). Frank's approach to ""justice"" is reminiscent of Walking Tall or Death Wish or the other vigilante movies.

I am midway through the second season and enjoying the ride very much. I do not recommend the series to anyone squeamish about violence or raw language. For anyone else, I highly recommend Lilyhammer."
Lilyhammer,LilyHammer Simply Amazing.,"Steve is amazing in the show and its creation, great story line, great characters. I really hope Nexflix runs 10 seasons. Good job Netflix keep making Lilyhammer the great show that it is. Great job Steve.

Anyone who watches the first episode will be hooked into watching all eight amazing episodes in one day. The show has its great funny points throughout all episodes, and a great story line with amazing talent from all the cast. Please Take sometime to watch this amazing first time production by Netflix.

Frank ""The Fixer"" Tagliano (Steven Van Zandt), a former member of the New York mob, is put in the witness protection program after testifying in a trial in the United States. Tagliano is relocated to Lillehammer in Norway as he was intrigued by the town when he saw television images of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and therefore chooses to start his new life, as Norwegian-American immigrant Giovanni Henriksen."
Lilyhammer,Great show!,Comentario no disponible
Lilyhammer,Great New Crime Drama...with some comedy,"I first heard of Lilyhammer through a Howard Stern interview with Steven Van Zandt. Since I was a huge Sopranos fan I immediately became interested in Lilyhammer. The show itself is great and I'm really impressed with Netflix's first original program. One concern is that they would not have enough funding to continue the project. Lilyhammer will never be confused with Soprano's but it has a lot of similarities to all organized crime dramas. Steven and the other actors do a great job, the only issue I have is sometimes it is difficult understand the native actors. While it does add authenticity to the setting it requires you to give your full attention to the screen. Luckily, the show is great and there is no worry of losing interest."
Lilyhammer,Would give it an 8 but last season is bad,"First season of Lilyhammer had me laughing frequently as our mafia fixer created his new life in a Norwegian town. The mix of his street wise business sense with the quaint Norwegian folks was funny and the characters were eccentric. Second season was okay but it was more of the same. Third season really fell flat. It was written in a frenetic pace with sub plots ranging from Brazil drug fiasco to Jan coming back from Iraq even nuttier than before. The storyline was all over and I found myself not laughing but instead wondering how any of it was supposed to be funny. Lots of adolescent male humor with blow jobs, male psychotic fixation on lactating breasts and nonsensical violence every ten seconds. IMDB has lost credibility when there are so many 9 and 10 ratings. Still, Van Zandt plays an excellent italian mobster and his motley crew of associates are all played by good actors. It was just the writing that lost its way. Some shows should only be one or two seasons."
Lilyhammer,Lilyhammer and Netflix,"When I first heard Netflix was making an original episode I was not at all impressed. I was like great, pile on crap to your already disgraced name. Well, I was wrong. Forgive me Netflix. I absolutely, love this new series. I put the show on this afternoon, and I have been glued to it all day. I am now on the 8th episode. Van Zandt (The Sopranos) is ruthlessly awesome. He may be a thug/wiseguy, and uses his bullish ways to get what he wants in this small, sheepish town of Norway, but you find yourself attached to his character. The townspeople, each have unique story to tell. They are all odd in a wonderful way.

The only thing I see a problem is.., subtitles. I like it, but may turn off some viewers. So, if your not a foreign film watcher, or like to read, you will hate it. No, this is not a foreign film...just an example. The entire film is spoken in Norweign with atiny bit of English spoken. So be warn. Who knows you might like it, and learn a new language. It could happen. Overall, I love Steven Van Zandt is in this series..A+ job."
Lilyhammer,Fargo on steroids,"Just finished binge watching the 2 seasons. Little Steven and a motley crew of Norwegian oddball characters scamming their way through Lillehammer- how can you go wrong with that. The dialog is a mix of Norwegian and English. Don't let subtitles scare you off. The characters are original, dialog out of this world and the setting totally cool. No pun intended. Steven van Zandt was born to play this part. There are subtle hints to the Sopranos and Bruce Springsteen. This show is not your run of the mill B.S American rehashed trite story lines. Its a Norwegian production, fresh, funny and just brilliant and totally addictive. If you are into travel this will inspire you to visit Norway.

Can't wait for season 3."
Lilyhammer,Starts great but dies a little each season,"It started as something different and very entertaining, however each season seems to lose a little bit of the magic. I would give the first season 8 Stars oh, the second season seven stars, and the third season 6 Stars, which ends up with an average of 7 out of 10.

It's definitely a show worth watching especially the first season. Season two and three are worth while watching too, they're just not as good. It's really too bad that the writing went downhill cuz the show had a lot of potential and I threw it all away."
Lilyhammer,Norwegian show not American,"A lot of people seems to think that this is a US produced show ... It's not ! The show is a Norwegian idea and written, directed and produced in Norway by a Norwegian company. It's not an original American / Netfix produced show. Netfix only bought the rights to show it in the USA If you look at the list of production crew, you wont see any American names: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1958961/fullcredits#cast Does anyone here really think that any multi zillion dollar American production studio would spend money on a series in Norway, with mostly Norwegian actors, language and culture ? get real ! The show is great by the way

and to ""eastcoastguyz"" comment of 5 May 2012

""This is a spin-off from The Sopranos regardless if anyone wants to admit it or not. Same character with a different name. The show had promise but it's ruined by excessive subtitles that are totally uncalled for. In Norway they also speak English, so there is no need for the subtitles for a series that's target is the American audience""

The show is first and foremost targeted to a Norwegian audience. Netflix has become somewhat involved in season 2, but it is still targeted first and foremost to the Norwegian audience. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ( NRK ) has the first hand right to broadcast the series and decides how many seasons etc. Unless NRK decides to not want to continue with the show, that's how it is.

The series has been sold to over 130 countries world wide.

As for Language and subtitles ... It would be a silly series, if everyone were to speak English. English is not the main Language in Norway and while it no doubt would be comfortable for an English speaking audience, it would look and sound totally ridiculous in a series made from Norway. It would be unnatural. We live in the real world up here North ..."

Lilyhammer,And I really wanted to like this..,"I'm a fan of Steve Van Zandt, both from his appearances in The Sopranos and from his years with the E Street Band. The premise of the series was good too, an ex-Mafioso on witness protection in the wilds of Norway attempting to navigate the countries PC culture and build a not-too-honest future. This whole fish-out-of-water concept had the makings of a sort of Sopranos/Fargo hybrid. All good so far, right?

Unfortunately, a good series needs a good concept, writing, acting and execution. Lilyhammer has the concept but everything else is missing.

The storyline quit frankly is ludicrous. Everything just happens through a series of unbelievable coincidences. I could list a dozen or more totally implausible occurrences in the first few episodes alone, but don't want to introduce spoilers. And as for the love interest...When the series was first aired in 2012, Steve Van Zandt was 62 and Marian Saastad Ottesen was 36. Can you really believe a Norwegian blonde would fall far a man who's shorter than her and 26 years older?

Regarding the acting, I know that most of the supporting cast had to contend with playing characters that were essentially wooden caricatures with no depth, but still.. quite a lot of the acting was pretty amateurish unfortunately. And that includes you Steve. Mafia tough guy seems to be the beginning and end of your acting skills, with no subtlety or variation to the hunched shoulders and knowing nods, a bit like ""mafia guy by numbers"" acting.

The execution was pretty poor too. I have no problem with subtitled movies, but found the constant chopping between spoken English and subtitles jarring and confusing. Quite a bit of the dialogue was switching between languages mid-sentence, resulting in not knowing whether to listen, look or both. For me it simply didn't work. Also, the cuts between scenes didn't work for me either, appearing haphazard with little thought or consideration of transition.

As I said at the beginning, I really wanted to like this series. Unfortunately for me it fell short on so many levels, and most especially on not having a coherent or plausible storyline, that I can only rate it two stars, both of which I'm essentially awarding for the concept. Apart from that I'd consign the series to ""sleeping with the fishes"" as they say in the Mafia."
Lilyhammer,black comedy in tongues,"this Netflix exclusive series was a delight to watch. full of darkness and humor . the characters are diverse and unique . adds some culture shock for non residents of Norway and its a fun ride to watch a light hearted look at a mafia goon go good sort of?

it nice that he makes good decision amount bad when it comes to helping out the right people. definitely looking forward to more episodes and worth watching a couple times.

The setting is very unique, the story may be predictable at times but over all still a great chapter series.

it does contain course language, some racial inappropriateness, nudity and other sensitive material for some viewers."

Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,I really enjoyed this,This is a hilarious very black British comedy full of delightful performances. It's cool to see Rupert Grint not wearing a wizard's robe and Lindsay Lohan not high. I had plenty of fun watching this
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Keeps you on your toes,It is funny. And it has some very high suspense levels.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Entertaining,"Silly comedy, that keeps you watching, just to see what happens next."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Great show, Rupert is very funny","But there is one remark I have to make, not referring to the show. How come almost all the images are of Lindsay Lohan Has she hacked the image section or what...?"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Unexpected hilarity,"If you think you have a dark sense of humour or have any sarcastic tendencies, prepare to be shocked. This is your test. Breath of fresh air. Funny when it shouldn't be. Takes serious issues and twists them to create bizarre situations that you can't help but root for and find funny...even when bizarre...ludicrous...out of this world at times! Another weekend binge watch MUST! Casting deserves a special mention - supporting cast are fantastic despite the sometimes (overall it's fabulous!) SOMETIMES slow, even stalling dialogue. A third of the first series could have been cut due to slow and unnecessary dialogue. A faster pace in future series (hopefully!) would be great! Direction and production overall great - camera crew (editors? Sorry for technical ignorance )deserve a special mention for the ""putting together"" which helps the overall performance and effect by at least 80% I imagine. Geniuses. In short, if you have an even slightly off centre sense of humour you need to watch this. If you don't, watch it anyway. The acting is actually superb and despite the location settings for any scene, the acting and storyline - no matter if you find it bizarre or believable, even if it seems uninteresting to you - I love the ludicrously overactive EVERYTHING personally - it all flows so well and becomes a believable and addictive addition to your life. I binged watched the first series in half a day. Mostly for ""Ron""s HE WILL ALWAYS BE RON DAMMIT performance. The dude can act his bloody socks off and it was refreshing to see him in a ""normal"" regular bloke type character that was an actual adult who you could understand and emphasise with wether you are a man or woman. It descends into chaos granted and he gets quite lost in the madness as a person and a genuine REAL character but he still breaks free of HP and is ""himself"" iykwim and he does it really bloody well. Much off tangent and quite ranty at parts - sorry - lady reviewer and first or second (?) review when insomniac strikes so I need some practice. BUT I hope despite my over writing you sensible people can read through the lines and see that what I mean is it is actually genius in hiding type writing and acting and you should watch it immediately! Download it, watch it drunk, sober, tired, full from bingeing on popcorn pizza and dr pepper(or Fanta fruit twist?!) it's worth the wasted hour or three (trust me, persevere) to see a couple - or four - episodes. Top tip; if you're single it takes your mind off the post one night stand misery:lack of hooking up. If you're with someone - newer the better IMO, it's the perfect silly sitcom series to watch post coitus/early weekend brunch in bed (guys (and girls-who bother to cook, ever..avocado/mushrooms/tomato's all or some/one whatever on toast goes down well the morning after etc, meat eaters grab some streaky or not bacon or sausages and fry up a sandwich feast. Nothing helps the first series episode go down well better than a greasy or open (poncy IMO - but I love em) sandwich!) Ps. Enjoy my super long ""helps you in the bathroom iykwim kinda review"" no longer do you need the back of the shampoo bottle - FYI they've edited them ALL to tell you they're trying not to poison the ocean. Star my bloody ranty review. Insomnia grew this! And Ron - he will FOREVER be Ron has grown up. Don't miss watching him break free in Sick Note. This might be the last REAL sitcom you see him in before Hollywood snap him up and he morphs into a factory style same old same old actor in yet another unbelievable Diaz-UK ""unknown"" actor rom-com. He needs the support of the UK for the work he is doing here and now. As does, most importantly, the writers producers directors and everyone else involved in Sick Note. It has been directed/edited/produced/written/everything else that goes into it BLOODY WONDERFULLY. Watching this, at times seemed slightly CRINGE. Slightly MEH, a little OH COME ON WHATEVER AS IF a few more times than I would have liked....but it was all GOOD IN CONTEXT. The flow and feel of the whole first series at least from start to end was consistent and gripping even if it were more lighthearted than the description suggested. It is a breath of fresh air and a rather truth ISH testament in some aspects to real life in my neck of the woods (from what I've been told - except the articulate speaking - no one is that well spoken all the time in London - anywhere realistically - not just south London OR north London. (Pls no one take offence LOL) It's overall a great easy watching funny show with some great actors. It deserves more exposure. End of. Bloody watch it. Ignore most of my ranty off course CouldveBeenTenTimesShorterReviewImSorry just bloody download it and watch it! Thanks! :)"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,What a great find on Netflix-Give us a season 3,"This show has been a binge watch for the fiancé and I! We love seeing a show with Rupert as a featured main character and who can go wrong with Nick Frost? There have been moments where we have laughed and have been shocked. There are times we have been on edge or even like oh no this is not for real! This show is a gem and a great find for us when everything has been starting to feel the same and we haven't been able to find much else to watch lately. I hope there is a season three and even a four because I cherish the chemistry between the two main characters. Plus, I'm a sucker for dark humor and British humor and this was just made to fill the void since having rewatched previous favorite shows too many times now.

As for Lohan though, I could do without. I am glad to see that they are trying with bringing her back to some shows and whatnot, but I find her bland and sometimes distracting."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,A Really Good Show,"Similar to many other black comedies, like Insatiable on Netflix, This show combines both the thrills of a crime show with the laughs of comedy. The second season is by far the best thing Lindsay Lohan has been on since Freaky Friday."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Funny, different, intriguing, great British humor.","Funny, different, intriguing, great British humor. I really enjoy this I thought it was pretty funny and very entertaining very silly but all in all well worth watching"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Pretty disappointing.,"Like many, I decided to give this show a shot because of Rupert Grint--better known as Ron Weasley. However, I was pretty disappointed from the start. What I thought might be the entire conflict of the whole show was resolved in the first episode--the other five of the season were random, poorly written, and pretty stupid. Rupert plays Daniel, who is generally likable, but that doesn't make up for all the messy plot holes and lame side characters. There are a few cheap laughs here and there, but nothing that really strikes me as clever or ""witty"". Everything about Sick Note screams mediocre to me. After struggling through the first season, I have decided to call it quits. I don't blame any of the actors, I think they are doing pretty well, but the writing comes across as amateurish at best. The basic concept for the show was good I thought, but the delivery is poor--could have been much better."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Season 3 please!!,"Funny, exiting and it got it all! Please where is season 3,4,5,6..?"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Liked it.,Comentario no disponible
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Good actors, poor show","I really like the actors, but the show is a bit annoying, particularly Will 5000."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Amazing comedy,"Classic British comedy and love seeing Ron Weasley as the lead actor for this series, I hope they will realease more seasons! Overall enjoyed the stupidness of the characters and lies and how one thing led to all the acts in the series! I abselutly loved it and had my goofs and gags watching them."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,What A Tangled Web We Weave,"Saunders and Serafinowicz have created a superb comedy series. This series has excellent direction, cinematography, writing, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast delivers perfectly timed comedic performances. In particular Grint, Frost, Johnson and even Lohan stand out. Johnson has never been as funny. His facial expressions, gesticulations and vulgar dialogue are hilarious. The plot revolves around Daniel Glass who is the proverbial down and out average joe who is also a compulsive liar, the most incompetent oncologist on earth Dr. Iain Glennis and a somewhat accidental death involving both characters. Dan is diagnosed with cancer by Dr. Glennis then revels in the sympathy and a new enthusiasm towards life. Soon afterwards Dan finds out he was misdiagnosed. While this is happening an accidental death occurs due to infidelity involving Dan's best friend. Dr. Glennis attempts to assist Dan in covering the situation up. This ignites a web of lies upon lies upon lies. Dan is ultimately forced to come clean with everything and go back to his monotonous life or to keep the ruse running. The plot is clever, witty, duplicitous, intelligent, insightful and is hilarious at times. This is a binge worthy series and substantial in it's genre."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Hilarity and madness sprinkled with absolute insanity. In the best way possible!,"I've just finished the first season after a complete binge. I love Rupert Grint. I love Nick Frost. And the two together have such incredible chemistry, rapport and comic timing that it's just a toe cringing, drink snorting, belly laugh inducing joy to watch.

The supporting characters are also great in their overwhelming absurdity of nuances and stereotypes that make up this show. But it pulls it off. It does not remotely take itself too seriously, which is why it's so enjoyable. It embraces the madness and surrealism with flair and humour.

It's been a long time since I've been so gripped, entertained and pleasantly surprised by a show.

I haven't even started the second season yet, though I will immediately after leaving this review, but I just know that 8 more episodes won't be enough for me. Here's hoping for a third season!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,"Great silly, dark comedy","Rupert, Nick and Pippa are great leads in this silly and dark comedy. I'm so glad I was drawn in to checking it out. The rest of the cast is also very enjoyable and Don Johnson and Lindsey Lohan are hilarious American eccentrics. The only draw back to me was that the American video game guy storyline could have used some work in my opinion. Otherwise it's a string comedy I look forward to watching more of!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Stick With It - Truly Hilarious,"I was skeptical - but delighted to find Rupert Grint from Harry Potter fans was in it - the only reason to watch at first, but by the beginning of season 2 I was hooked! This is truly hilarious and Grint's comedic performance is inspired! It really is laugh out loud funny - and Don Johnson and Nick Frost are better than expected."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Not Bad,This show has a very good idea behind it but I didn't find it all that funny to be honest. I do like Rupert Grint though and he makes me smile if not laugh at the comedy in this show.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Terrible writing ! JUST NOT FUNNY,Comentario no disponible
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Loved it!,"Insane plot line with plenty of funny and tense moments, talented actors and amazing characters couldn't recommend it enough."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Entertaining and wacky!,"This show leaves the viewer wanting more after every twist and turn. It's not perfect and can be quite silly, but enjoyable! I do hope they have a 3rd season!"
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Painful to watch.,A good dark comedy was Misfits for the first few seasons. I got to episode 6 of Sick Note and I just can't handle how campy this show is. Great talent just wasted on terrible writing.
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Don't listen,"Don't listen to the poor reviews. Anyone who doesn't think this show is funny has no sense of humor. It's NOT deep, or dramatic, it's exactly what it is. A light, campy comedy full of impossible situations designed to make you laugh.

If you liked scary movie or that type of thing you will find it funny."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Interesting to say the least,"I started watching because of Rupert and I have to say is acting is great, doesn't disappoint. It was also wonderful to see Lindsey Lohan back on the screen. However I would describe this as a show to watch while you are doing a puzzle: doesn't need you to be fully engaged at the screen. It was definitely weird and lots of madness, every character seems to be messed in the head one way or another. I definitely think show would go over well with certain types of people but for me, I never fully enjoyed myself while watching it. I'm not holding out for a season 3."
Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories,Extremely good and funny,Rarely seen such a funny series that you could binge watching so well.

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,gets better every episode,"transformers rid is the sequel to transformers prime, while that show had a very dark and a brooding tone, this show show is a little light hearted as the there is no major apocalypse or anything, this new show is about a prison ship landed on earth, with decepticons in it getting free and now its up to bumblebee and couple others to stop them because optimus is busy doing something unknown,which means its story lines are about the villain of the week while still continuing the story of the new big bady steeljaw, so lets break down this series:first the animation, the animation is cgi rendered in 2d, while prime had great visuals, this one is all great by itself, featuring smooth fight scenes , out standing transformations and over the top car chases on later episodes, (there is one that reminded of the dark of the moon movie high way chase scene), the character designs are great (although you might not like grimlock for not being g1 grimlock at all), second: the storyline: i already said that its about the villain of the week, but that doesn't mean its bad or anything, its actually fun and most important of all, there is some major character development, something that transformers prime kinda lacked, i highly recommend this series, and if you watched the first 2 episode and stopped, you should continue as they are the weakest,all in all :transformers rid 2015 is a highly recommended series(coming by a long time transformers fan), being different isn't always bad, as fans have bee continuously disliking every incarnation since g1, and g1 isn't that good really, as this show is logically ten times better than g1."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Fun,"As a follow-up to Transformers Prime, I can understand why some people found this show disappointing, however I thought it was still fun and entertaining.

The plot is a pretty standard villain of the week set up, with some overarching elements that fall apart under too much scrutiny and characters that don't really learn from their mistakes (presumably so that the episodes are relatively easy to understand when watched out of order on television) It introduces a lot of interesting concepts (ex. Cybertronian sign language) that unfortunately don't really get expanded on, but they're fun for the episodes they're in!

The animation is pretty average. I appreciate that the robot designs are somewhat simpler so that kids watching it might actually be able to draw their favourite characters.

The music in most episodes is pretty average. The Starscream theme is a banger, but the intro music is possibly the worst intro music I've ever heard and the rest of it is pretty forgettable so all in all it evens out.

Honestly though, a lot of the jokes landed for me, it's set up well for its target audience, and I had fun. If you're looking for a light bit of transformers entertainment and you're prepared to view this as a separate entity to Transformers Prime I don't think you should rule this show out as an option :)"

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Good but like 'expect the unexpected'.,"For me,Transformers Prime was the best Transformers series i ever watched and Robots IN Disguise is somehow, a little distanced from what was Transformers Prime.It is improving with the stories, but its really not like Autobots stopping grand plots of EVIL Decepticons, but a lot of comedy and 4 Autobots struggling to control just one Decepticon every episode-NO grand EVIL yet and no big mastermind;just catch some Decepticons, put them in stasis.. and make sure they stay that way.Now , speaking of the comedy, you want to see a burger splat on Optimus Prime's face 'cause that would the silliest and most disrespecting thing happening to Optimus in all the animated multi-verse...now i am not saying loose that touch suddenly 'cause if that does the show will loose popularity and'll be canceled.I don't want that , i want the Prime animated universe to continue, now that they have introduced an OK but 'etu'innegative sequel.I say IMPROVE."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,The worst entry in the Transformers franchise (even worse than the latest movies),"Robots in Disguise should be a shame to the franchise as a whole. It is supposed to be a follow up series to the highly acclaimed Transformers Prime, but it failed miserably. As a stand alone series, it also struggles to justify itself. The plot is extremely silly and repetitive: there is a random animal-looking decepticon that is trying to make a mess in the nearby city, the autobots have to capture him, but one of them has to learn a lesson before doing so (a lesson that is gonna be forgotten in the next episode). This happens over and over again. The characters lack deepness and evolution, the main plot line (that holds viewers on the long run) is practically absent. This series survived from toys, nostalgia and fan-service. It is literally garbage."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Just Awful,"I agree with the reviewers who rated this series one star. As a transformers fan, I enjoyed Transformers Prime and was excited to watch this show. But boy, was I wrong. I watched three episodes and stopped. This show is downright awful and the characters made it worst. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are the only ones that carried over from Transformers Prime. The others are terrible. For the Autobots, there's slacker Sideswipe, an uptight femme bot Strongarm (who looks like a male) and an annoying minibot Fixit. On the Decepticons, there's Steeljaw and the others such as Thunderhoof and Springload are just butt ugly. The story line is corny and there's no mention of Megatron, Starscream, Soundwave and Airachnid. Overall, this show is terrible and too cartoony. If you're into Transformers Rescue Bots, this show is for you. Otherwise, avoid this series."

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,More Than Meets The Eye,"Now I had mix feelings about Transformers:Robots In Disguise for a few reasons

1.It was on the Cartoon Network, a station I still have a bitter feeling to since they don't play any good shows anymore.

2.It was titled ""Robots In Disguise"" because we already had a Transformers from 2001 called Robots Ind Disguise even though it was a dub from Japan's Car Robots it's still the Principal If I had a voted I would have called it Transformers:Legacy since this series is a follow up to Transformers Prime.

But still once I set down to watch it, it still felt good to be a fan of Transformers. They said this series is suppose to target a younger crowd needless to say I believe this series is fit for all fans of the Transformers because it features a lot that fans have love about the series since 1984

This time the Autobots are Bumblebee, Sideswipe,Strongarm, Grimlock and Fixit with guest stars from Optimus Prime, Drift,Jetstorm Slipstream Windblade and Jazz

The Decepticons are Steeljaw, Underbite, Hammerstrike, Bisk, Chop Shop, Terrashock, Thunderhoof, Filch, Springload, Fracture, Airazor, Divebomb and too many more to count

While the first episode did take time for me to get use to I started to enjoy the series as each episode actually makes watching this series worth while.

It features a very well done cast of voice actors who give a entertaining voice performance in each episode. I like the animation style they have for this series it gives the series it's original work and that's not easy to do anymore in TV

Plus the plot for each episode is very creative and it does a lot to work for kids and adults that love Transformers

As a long time fan of Transformers I can say is this show is More Than Meets The Eye"

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Kids Love It,"My kids can't stop watching it. They are 3, 5, and 8 and it's one of the few shows they will watch together. Anytime I would allow them to watch a show, they all asked to put it on. Even my husband enjoyed it. I hope that they have more seasons planned as my kids keep asking for new episodes."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Total Disappointment,"A complete waste of time and a total let down after Transformers Prime. I died a little inside after watching episode 1, which was a struggle to complete. I have no plans to watch any of the other episodes as even watching this one episode was just too painful. My 9-year-old even hates it. He loved Prime, but he is totally disappointed in this one. I tried to like it, but it just isn't happening. Unless you want to be disappointed like us, I recommend you stay far away. Hopefully the creators will realize what they have done and bring back Prime. Bad CGI, horrible plot, and even worse character voice-overs. Total Disappointment. :("

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,A disgraceful sequel,Comentario no disponible
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Don't compare this to Prime,"I have not yet finished the first season, but I really want to give this show the praise it deserves. There are a lot of negative reviews complaining that RID does not live up to its predecessor, Transformers Prime. This is true, but RID is enjoyable in its own right, and shouldn't have to live in the shadow of Prime.

One of the biggest complaints is about the animation. It does take some getting used to, but I find that it's very expressive and neat! The humans look a little strange, but they did in Prime, too. The robots have good facial expressions and body language, and each character has a unique design. I'm sure it will improve even more with time--everyone remembers the incredible progress that Prime made in the animation department.

The characters are truly the strong point of the show, though. They are diverse, well- rounded and lovable. I was not very fond of Bumblebee in Predacons Rising, but he has redeemed himself in RID. Strongarm is a wonderful addition to the cast, and a much needed female presence in the franchise. I won't go into too much detail to avoid spoilers, but the characters have a lot of heart. There is also one character who I won't name for spoilers but has particularly strong, moving and realistic characterization so far, and really cemented my love for the show.

One thing in particular that I like is that one of the characters, Fixit, has a clear speech impediment, and no one makes fun of him for it.

Other strong points: It's a typical ""villain of the week"" setup for the most part, but that makes it easy to keep up with and stops it from getting too dramatic. It's funny and light- hearted, and the voice actors are wonderful.

I've been a Transformers fan since 2011, although my interest in it diminished after Prime's finale and Age of Extinction. Prime is my favorite series, and I was so sad to see it go. I still miss it sometimes. I didn't even watch RID until more than a year after it premiered. However, RID renewed my love for the franchise with great vigor, and I place it as #2 on my list of Transformers series--right beside Prime."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,THIS ISNT TF PRIME,Comentario no disponible
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,The 'Transformers' franchise reaches low-point quality with 'Robots in Disguise',"The 'Transformers' animated shows have been very mixed overall. While there are some great shows such as 'Transformers' (1984), 'Beast Wars' and 'Prime' there are also some poor ones such as 'Victory' and ""The Unicron Trilogy"" ('Armada' especially, with 'Cybertron' the least bad but not saying a lot).

'Robots in Disguise' is among the franchise's worst and the worst 'Transformers' show since 'Armada'. It is redeemed by the character of Steeljaw, the most impressively designed, one of few of the characters to register positively or have intrigue value and the best voiced, deserving of being in the show more. As well as some vibrant colours and a few interesting characters, again particularly with Steeljaw.

However, some of the animation in terms of movement is static and slow, meaning that as well as dumbed down the action sequences feel lazy and lack urgency or momentum. While a few of the characters have intriguing designs, some do look weird, especially Bumblebee, Strongarm and Grimlock. The music is not awful as such, but it doesn't have the memorability factor and is not as dynamic as it should be.

Where 'Robots in Disguise' particularly fails is in the writing and characterisation. The writing is incredibly lazy and while certainly too juvenile for adults even children will find that it is too simplistic and dumbed down for them. Any attempts at humour fall flat and some of the more repetitive ones wear well thin very quickly, especially with Fixit, Strongarm and Grimlock.

A vast majority of the characters are obnoxiously out of character or simplified to dumbness (i.e. Grimlock), lack personality (Megatronus, true of most of the Decepticons who act more stupid than threatening is far too under-utilised and lacks any kind of menace) or are irritating (as well as being that Sideswipe serves as a terrible role model and Drift is an annoying jerk). Someone please also decide what personality and such to give Russell, because the frequently indecisive characterisation and writing is really grating. Steeljaw and Jazz are two of few exceptions.

'Robots in Disguise' is lacking when it comes to its storytelling too. Some episodes are paper-thin and static, while others cram in too much, so parts either feel hectic or incredibly pedestrian. The severe lack of tension and conflict and that it does very little with quite old ideas.

Not much good to say about the voice work either. There are a few talented names here (with some prolific names), but almost all either have little to do, have annoying and ill-fitting voices (Megatronus and Bisk are notably jarring) or are over-parted. Steeljaw fares the least badly by far in this regard.

Overall, despite giving it a fair and honest chance, 'Robots in Disguise' is one of the worst 'Transformers' shows with not much good to say about it. 2/10 Bethany Cox"
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,A step down from the previous serie,"As many have already expressed, this serie is a bit of a step down from the previous one Supposed to be its sequel, it lack the depth and plot of its predecessor

But then, it's obvious that this was not made with the same aim in mind This is clearly a ""villain of the week"" type of serie, with each episode throwing out a new villain, with the aim of selling toys of them

Kids can easily appreciate the humours and there were some good moment, but I was very disappointed with how they handled the whole ""sequel"" thing

Barely any connection to the past serie, this could be considered standalone without problems, and it might actually be better off"

Transformers: Robots In Disguise,Decline from Transformers Prime,"Old characters are shown weaker than they were. Bumblebee is shown as arrogant and selfish while Optimus is shown not as wise as he was. Villians are not interesting.

Transformers prime was a amazing series and for it to have a sequel like this is disappointing. This is probably the worst transformers series since Armada.

Worst part is how weak and unwise Optimus Prime is portrayed. In Transformers prime, he was the leader of the Autobots and was experienced, wise, strong and led the Autobots to victory. Here, he is the complete opposite.

If you wanted to portray these characters as weak, you could have just made a completely separate show and not a sequel. Overall, this is very disappointing."
Transformers: Robots In Disguise,TF4ever,"The series is great, and if we vote enough to it could get another season, all transformers series have been different, there is nothing wrong with this one, but it must have Megatron in it, and the return of the three kids from prime. I have a YouTube videos about it. I wonder why Megatron hasn't appeared yet. Everyone would love that, wound't you?. We should have a poll for it, I can't wait to see what cartoon Hasbro has next for the transformers. However it's all Star Wars and frozen at the moment, and just because transformers was meant for boys doesn't mean it should have more male characters, that makes it unfair, it should be for both boys and girls, it's the same with My little pony, the new baby was said to be a foul but became a female, I'm not saying I don't like her, I do, it's just that like transformers it's cented on one gender, and has more of one gender in it, I wish more girls were involved with transformers."

Hi Score Girl,Incredible anime,"I'd say that's the best anime I've seen and in the list of them I'm comparing this , also stands ""Deathnote"". Hi-score Girl is a series that every generation after the Y one (80's +) can relate to and bring back sweet childhood memories. It's really well written and masterfully directed. Won't dissapoint any modern or even ""retired"" arcade gamer. Looking forward for the even more romantic sequel , considering from the last episode. Won't say more . Give it a try now !"
Hi Score Girl,Nostalgia!,"Loved this anime! It was funny, it was cute and it brought me back to past! I got hyped as they started playing street fighter 2 in the start of the anime and haven't stopped watching since. The pace is really nice and there is a good mixture of humourous moments and real human feelings. It's a short series so it's easy even if this is not your genre. I really recommend this anime!"
Hi Score Girl,Last episode of season 2 was😢😭,"I don't know but this is one of my most favourite romantic animes😭 and that last episode of S2 made me cry, I'm 28 years old and I'm still single but that ok, at least I get to watch about other character's love and struggle in animes 😭😢. I know in real life love is more complicated but fuck that anime is awesome😭."
Hi Score Girl,"Came in with little expectation, came out hungry for more","This is the first anime that made me itch to know the ending of the story, so much that I couldn't contain myself and started reading the mangas and even going through raw non translated chapters to complete the story with Google Translate.

I never expected to get so hooked into a rom-com retro gaming story. I'm born in 1990 so I missed the arcade boom by a few years. Nevertheless, it still brought me joy and as a gamer who played later releases of Capcom and Sony.

I don't want to spoil the story but I finished the 12 eps on Netflix on one go, I just couldn't stop. The episodes are short and I know the CG put a lot of people down, but please, please, watch it until the end because it is so short anyway !

This is truly underrated and I don't say this lightly."
Hi Score Girl,One of the best,"One of the best anime in 2018. If you liked to play arcade games back in 90's, you will love this anime too. Anime has great character development and warm story Watch it, you won't regret it..."
Hi Score Girl,"I loved this series, despite one nitpick","The series is a loveletter to the 90s era of arcades and a coming of age tale of love between two girls and a boy. Harou is a young boy in elementary school in 1991, he's bullied by both teachers and classmates alike, told he's worthless and has no skills. So he seeks escapism in the fantasy of the game centers of Japan, while it would seem like he has little skills in life, at video games he's a pro. But one day he comes up against an opponent that utterly destroys him in his favorite game (Street Fighter II), only to find out that his opponent is a classmate of his .. and a girl. What's more she's a rich girl who he sees as an outsider in his world of escapism, so he uses exploitative strategy against her which starts off their love-hate relationship.

Her name is Oono Akira, a mute girl who feels like she is being crushed under the responsibilities of being the heir to the family business, and also seeks escapism for this reason. The two of them form a bond together, but her future has been planned since the day she was born with talk of an arranged marriage when she reaches maturity. Can Harou and Akira survive together? What's more, entering into the mix is another girl named Hidaka who, like Akira, resents and even hates Harou at first, but is also touched by Harou's kind (if stupid and oblivious) nature, and learns to stop worrying quite as much about the hardships of life and have fun... And along the way loses her heart to him. But what about Akira? Well that's up to you to find out.

Described as a ""love comedy"" as opposed to ""romantic comedy"" by the author, the series plays through cycles which is frustrating until finally beginning in the third cycle the protagonist finally asks himself ""why do I keep resetting to zero?"" at which point I couldn't help but exclaim ""YES, WHY?"" There's a greenlit second season in October of this year (2019), though the series is already completed in manga form at a rather light 63 chapters at 10 volumes. One could probably read through the whole thing in a single day if they were truly inclined. Which I set out to do, I did not successfully read it in one day, but that's neither here nor there.

Having watched the anime and not wanting to wait til October (though I'll watch the second season anyway), I decided to investigate the manga. And I was rather shocked by what I found. While the anime was mostly faithful and unswerving from most of the anime, the anime actually omits contextual scenes from the manga. For example, Akira who is mute and thus is never able to say words to express herself has a few scenes in the manga where her thoughts are conveyed. By denying her thoughts, she is denied of any real agency in the anime and thus we're forced to try and understand her reasoning when she blankly looks at something. Perhaps they will go back in season 2 and reveal these scenes of agency, but I felt the need to deduct a point for this because I found that to be frustrating.

The two characters I enjoyed most were Hidaka and Akira (not in any particular order, it'd be hard to pick one over the other). Harou's otaku (obsessive) nature makes him a character that I found hard to like, as he misses the obvious all the time, and when trying to express himself can't help but go into a roundabout conversation about some video game. I get that it's exaggerated on purpose, but that doesn't really make it better.

The OP I didn't much care either way, but that outro song is so good that I found it frustrating when Netflix kept trying to skip it. If you like love stories, this is quite possibly the most unconventional one I've ever seen. I liked it so much I decided I wanted to read the manga so that I didn't miss anything. Definitely worth a watch. Hidaka is lovable, and Akira are adorable, and any time they're on the screen you'll find yourself rooting for them.

Also of note, this anime does not rely on sexuality or fanservice of any kind. There's a couple of throwaway jokes here, and in the manga Hidaka's point of view on the sexism in the Game Centers makes sense, but Netflix chose to leave that particular scene out and focus on character development, if only they had taken the time to keep Akira's agency intact, considering how little of it there is."
Hi Score Girl,The beauty of the arcades and romance,I just found this anime to be fantastic. Not only reminding me of when arcade where the centre of attraction but also of hopeless romantic high schoolers and all the awkwardness that brings. Beautifully Portrayed with some surprisingly moving scenes. A must watch for all 80s & 90s. Season 2 please.
Hi Score Girl,I love anime that completely lacks supernatural elements,Comentario no disponible
Hi Score Girl,most amazing romantic/gaming combination,"The boy is almost as same age as me. although i dont have the same experience(especially the girl exp), but I have some much resonance of the episode. love it"
Hi Score Girl,A lot of game referrences,"Used to be a big game addict. Love retro classic arcade games, gameboy, snes n64, 3ds, etc. This anime brings back a lot of my childhood memories. Grow up playing street fights, final fights, etc. Great sense of humor, potrayal of friendship & romance. A gem for those that into slice of life anime with high school romance & comedy punch. Highly recommended."
Hi Score Girl,UGLY BOOHOO CRIED,I went to the trouble of making an account to say this is one of the funniest/saddest/frustrating anime's iv ever seen!!! The second season came out today and iv already finished it!!! I was turned off the idea at first cause sooo many Lolis but I don't even care this show is so freaking good!! It may have a slightly slow start but seriously it is worth every minute!! Also seeing as games had a big part of my life the nostalgia was a perfect 10!! I prefer horror/grown up based anime but this is by far the exception. Both seasons will make you scream/cry/laugh simultaneously!!!!! Do yourself a favor. Watch it. NOW!! Stop reading reviews and just go watch it! Yes I'm talking to YOU!!!
Hi Score Girl,Hmmm....okay?,"I watched the first 5 episodes..so loving and heartwarming and fun...but what happens after ep 5? Did i start watching another show by mistake...even IMDB is confused what happens after 5. It even got the name wrong (High Score Girl)

Also...what was with the girl feeling the guy's penis? that was way out of focus for the show..way way way off"
Hi Score Girl,Gamer Fantasy,"I stopped watching at Round 7. The main driver for me to continue watching is nostalgia. However, it could not overcome many issues I have with this series.

This story is about a gamer and his romance with his classmates. I was hoping for the gamer to grow into someone like a hero that has redeeming qualities. However, the gamer continued to be clueless, and the girls continue to fall in love with him.

Nostalgia is strong with this one, but unfortunately it doesn't have enough legs to carry me through the many problems with the main characters."
Hi Score Girl,Watching it for the 2nd time,Highly recommend watching this. It's on Netflix! Give it a try
Hi Score Girl,Just beautiful,"It's a real bonus for those of us old enough to remember arcades in the 90s to see how well those old game characters are integrated into the lives of the characters. This is such an original and moving story with amazing characters. By the way I avoid romantic stories usually, but this is really special."
Hi Score Girl,Happy tears,"Amazing rememberers, fine mix of drama and cool gaming anecdotes, however I wondering how much cost to bring all the brands of arcade world in only one place, anyway I wait for more productions of this kind in order to allow immersion of new generations in this great and magical past."
Hi Score Girl,Hi Score Girl: Love it a great story,Comentario no disponible
Hi Score Girl,Absolutely superb,Cannot fault this Anime. So unique. So excellently delivered. With the backdrop of gaming to express emotions. My fave anime ever by a long long way.
Hi Score Girl,Beautifully written and animated,"Good story, strong characters and a good mix of humor and melancholy 👍"
Hi Score Girl,Season 2 English Subtitles RUINED THIS ANIME!,"I loved season 1 of this anime. Good story, love the art and the English subtitles flowed smoothly and did what they were supposed to do. The Japanese voice actors were all superb and helped make this anime a hit.

And then season 2 came out. Released first in Japan, all we could do in the US was wait and wait and wait for Netflix to finally finish putting everything together for a multi language release. And here it was today! I eagerly watched the first episode and for the most part is sounded and looked the same as season 1. I was mildly surprised by a few words in the English subs that did not show up in the first season. I wrote it off as an aberration and continued into episode 2. And there it was. Tasteless profanity where it has no place. Does the person who translated and wrote these subs have any idea at all about Japanese culture and language?? F-bombs and other profanity all over the place! THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING!!! It felt a bit like switching religions as I found myself holding my nose while changing over to English audio. But it really was the only choice. At least whoever wrote the script for the English voice cast knew what they were doing. As tasteless as it is for die hard anime fans to watch a dubbed show (only way to get the true cultural feel is original Japanese), it became the only choice. Netflix sure missed the mark on this one. it would be extremely worth it for them to redo the English subs. And as great as this anime is, it will remain 1 star in my book until this is fixed."
Hi Score Girl,Masterpiece,"Just watch it right away, instead of scrolling through more comments.. it's an epic, romantic, cybergeek anime.."
Hi Score Girl,Romance in the gaming world,"This Anime was really a surprise so this time I will try to be the as less spoiler and as more helpful as possible.

First and most important, this is not a romcom, this is a romantic story which span across 6 years from 6th grade till middle high school.

If it's ""Comedy"" or ""Fun"" what you are looking for, you should maybe turn to something else, and you should better decide first because once you start it's difficult to stop, the anime is intense and you will want to see the next episode as soon as possible.

If instead you are interested in the Arcade golden age (e.g. 80s, 90s, etc..) this is a must watch, or if you like Romance.

What I didn't like is the quality of the drawings and the sometimes too much attention of Haruo on the title release plans, but these are really peanuts if you are the right watch candidate because this anime feels like: ""Take a big breath and go underwater to stay there a little for the first time in your life"".

______________________________________________

I have finally decided to increase my rating because of the power of the message that this series comes with, I think that this should be shared and so now 9.

It has many graphical issues, also point of attentions, etc. But at the end what counts is what remains to you.

We are not machines that we can just do maths, although the contemporary society try to instruct to, we are humans after all (at least most of us)."
Hi Score Girl,Nostalgia from the 80's and the 90's,"Well I wasn't really born in the the 80's or the 90's but this anime was a really good watch. It showed hoe games (mainly street fighters) evolved and how consoles got better.

Haruo Yaguchi is a carefree kid who does not care about studying or socialising as mostly spends his time at home playing video games or at the arcades. Then he meets a very attractive girl by the name of Akira Ono who is a very smart girl with good grades, rich parents and a stuck up attitude but is actually more interested in arcade games then Haruo Yaguchi see her as a rival. For an unknown reason she does not talk at all in the series and the protagonist has to read her facial expression to understand her.

The story was good overall I can't wait for season 2 and I hope they expand more on the characters.

Edit 14/02/2021

Season 2 did a good job with adding more to the story. I hope they make a season 3 someday."
Hi Score Girl,One of the best anime that you would relate a lot,"Also screw the person who said that he wanted the protagonist to be a hero or have redeeming qualities. This is a romcom + slice of life kind of anime. This is not a BNHA or KNY sort of anime what do you expect?

Anyway for my review, there has been a lot of scenes in this anime that most of us can relate to and can apply in life.

These are:

1.) Escaping life problems through playing games

2.) Some people really are not aware about their feelings toward other people or how other people feel toward them.

3.) We should let our children set their own pace, it is their life, not hours. We should just guide them but not be strict to the point that they aren't free to move on their own. This would make them more happy.

Overall, I've only watched season 1, and I am going to watch season 2 next. This anime is one of the best there is when it comes to slice of life and rom com. You'll learn a lot and relate a lot. Also, bring some tissues with you, there are a lot of scenes where you'll be touched."
Hi Score Girl,This should be added to the list of the best animes,"I´m just gonna say this: I´m not a person too invested in romantic series, becasue they all are prone to be cliché, tedious or so soup opera -ish. But this one, this one is one of a kind.

You believe everything you watch, even if the plot is surrounded by arcade games, which is a risky choice, but they blend perfectly to the story.

I could have cried watching this anime, for sure a lot of people did. It´s so cute and heartwarming!!"
Black Lightning,Just keeps getting better,"EDIT: RARE that a series takes feedback and fixes everything that's wrong, but Black Lightening did that. I truly love this show now and hope it keeps going

Edit #2: spoke too soon. Once again the writers lost their way. I honestly feel this show had major potential to deliver on its... potential, not just as a beacon for social and racial justice, but also as a truly high quality superhero show. The actors did their absolute best with what they were given, and some shone brightly despite the writing, but sadly the formula for all these DC shows (Cheese + camp + cringe) remains a work in progress.

Original: Good premise and potential, and some good acting and special effects. Conversely, the massive cheese factor in the writing combined with some equally bad acting, make it impossible to really get involved in the show."
Black Lightning,"Hmmm, why are people slamming this show","Black Lightning's first episode was super cool and I see the potential for it to get even better. There was nothing ""over the top"" or ""a bit too much"" to a viewer with a mature and REALISTIC awareness to today's American Culture (for non-white individuals). Portraying such situations is reality and if that offends you then you simply deny reality. A comment was made that BLM created this show, how ignorant. If a drama showing what others experience irks you then perhaps YOU should not feel entitled to harshly judge what YOU don't understand. It's not for YOU so move along rather than try to destroy it -the American way- with nastiness and bigotry. The cast was perfect. His suit was just fine. The story will only get better despite what THEY say. After all, if a pathetic, unrealistic movie/shows like 300, Wonderwoman and Arrow etc can be tolerated them Black Lightning is perfectly fine. Forget what THEY say because THEY were going to be nasty regardless because this show doesn't cater to them via story line, visuals etc and it DOESN'T have too. GO BLACK LIGHTNING!!"
Black Lightning,Black Lightning has kept me watching,"I write as a fan of all Arrowverse superhero series and discovered Black Lightning via a crossover episode. I thought I would give the series a go and soon got hooked. It loses points for season 4, which I feel started badly, though it picked up in later episodes. Super-villain Tobias Whale (Marvin Jones III) is a very memorable character throughout the series and his evil chuckling fits well with his psychopathic nature. He makes an excellent opponent for Black Lightning and his family, as do the Markovians. I found I enjoyed the soundtrack too, and I am a singer-songwriter myself, and the choice of backing music can help make or break a TV drama for me. On the whole Black Lightning is an enjoyable superhero drama and one I will probably watch again some time in the future."
Black Lightning,A hard too watch...,"Looked interesting and I love a lot of superhero tv shows/movies but this... this is just terrible. The acting feels forced and hard to ignore, a lot of the characters are stereotypical with next to nothing unique about them."
Black Lightning,Excited for a Lead African American Hero though CW may need to pump the brakes a bit,"Being that only one episode has aired so far I'm not going to automatically say this show is destined to fail as I have high hopes for Black Lightning in a universe of predominantly Caucasian super hero's. I will say the first episode somewhat screamed victimization of African American's as though it was trying to compare the imaginary town to Chicago. I'm hoping this is somewhat toned down over the season because the first ep just kinda felt like a bit too much treating it as though the culmination of victimization and gang violence hitting home being the breaking point for Black Lightning giving him reason to adorn his mantle again. Had this been spread out over a few eps, I think maybe it would have been depicted better. Though I'm sure we will see him deal with the struggles of deciding to suit up again over the season I hope CW kinda slowly rolls his character out rather than just trying to force this part of the DC universe down our throats so they can align him with the rest of DC gang ie. Arrow, Flash, Legends and Supergirl."
Black Lightning,Surprisingly well done,"It looks most of the negative reviews here are all politically motivated. I wish people who claim others are snowflakes or oversensitive would stop being offended by everything to the point that it dominants their opinion on everything. This is a slick, well done, unique take on the superhero genre.It deals with modern day issues, speaks in a contemporary language, and shows evil from a perspective very rarely attended to in superhero story telling. It manages both camp and realism. Look, the world is changing, trying to silence or mitigate it thru baseless negativity will not change reality. Reality is this is a good show."
Black Lightning,Negative racist comments are made to thwart a really good program. Dont beliveve them.,"It's about time that the CW aired a show that relates to the black community, other than just airing shows like Gossip Girls, Dawson's Creek and One Tree Hill...omg It's refreshing to see a show about black heroism, black family values and black romance, its long overdue. There is absolutely no racist ideology in this show, and for anyone to call this show racist after only three episodes that deals with a principal promoting a message of education for black students and combating gang violence from the community, you are either a racist or you don't anything about the black community. This show is somewhat very true to life in the African-American school system. I would know because I teach in a predominantly black high school and truth be told there are some students who I would love to give a black lightning award to for their everyday heroism against the it struggle of fighting the drugs dealers, bullying, the neighborhood shootings making it to class and earning that A&B grade to graduate and become a success story in life. As an educator, Black lighting is refreshing, it sends a positive to black youths so kudos to CW for giving this show a chance. I'm gonna wait till the season is over to make another full review about the series. But to all you reviewers that are trying to paint this show as bias, I say SHAME ON YOU. I find it very suspicious that you access racism after only three episodes, that have no racist premise whatsoever. Black lightning is kinda cheesy, but overall good and never bias. Give it go."
Black Lightning,What in the fresh Hell was THIS mess?,"BAD. Do you hear me? Just BAD! I am a black female who tried VERY hard to like this show, but my GOD...it was even too much for me.

1 - WAY too many 'black issues' all in the first episode. The references to injustice were too many to count. I applaud a show that does delve into societal issues, but THIS was just nonstop...

2 - The acting was borderline community playhouse level. I take that back, THEY probably act better than this!

3 - I really liked the premise of the show though and enjoyed it right up to the part where Black Lightening put on that tacky ass costume. Once he got all dolled up and went to 'save the day'...the show LOST me. OMG! He was slow as Hell, the fight scenes are terribly choreographed, and again, the costume was NOT cool at all.

The whole show was just extra! I made it through the pilot episode and...that was it. I quit. Wasn't interested anymore. CW - please do better than this campy mess."
Black Lightning,The racists crawling out of the woodwork for this one,"And honestly, ignore the hissy fits they keep posting here, as if whining online, over and over, can make it any less pathetic. Black Lightning is not just about race, is the thing. A lot of the reviews on here make it seem like that because, and I repeat, the racists are showing up for this one. It's about family, and coming of age, and aging, and the gridlock of being powerful but conscious of that power's repercussions. Filmed beautifully, it's visually captivating and so easy to get in to that before you know it, you're knee deep in giving a crap about the characters. So far, Black Lightning is a good show. It's entertaining, it's engaging, and it's attempting to tackle a highly charged subject that needs to be tackled as often and as frankly as possible. It doesn't do so perfectly, no, but it's still brand new. I'm excited to see where it goes from here."
Black Lightning,Ok,It's not that bad I find myself liking it more than some of the marvel shows on Netflix.
Black Lightning,Black Dynamite without the irony,Genuinely so bad that I can't stop watching it. All the cliches of blacksploitation era productions like Shaft that were satirised in Black Dynamite are back here as if it's something novel. It's actually shamefully addictive and has an evil albino villain who belongs in an Austin Powers movie. Watch it- it's so terrible you won't be able to look away!
Black Lightning,"Ignore any low votes here and watch the show. Trust me, it will make perfect sense why they did. Same as it ever was.","First episode in and this is first rate, compared to recent oversaturated superhero show landscape. Not too campy, cartoonish or stereotypical but rather quite relatable, for members or non members of the depicted community. The acting is well done with no cringe worthy excess. This is This Is Us, with a different theme. Never having been one for superhero fare, either in novels or on screen, I heard the show runner interviewed on NPR and decided to check it out. For someone without a lot of time to watch TV, I lean into the usual top flight stuff, from Breaking Bad to GOT through Homeland, Good Wife, House of Lies and Westworlds, I will say that if the first episode is an apt indicator, do not be deterred from watching. They are compelling characters, a well balanced storyline and good actors to boot.

Those lamenting SJW, BLM etc, may have agendas, but if yours is good TV fare, watch it."
Black Lightning,Not 'Flash' or 'Arrow' but worth Watching,"This is NOT as bas as some reviewers have made out - it is fairly entertaining and does have some nice plot twists.

The acting is generally good albeit that, probably because of direction (see below), it is more than occasionally melodramatic in the style of a 1910 silent.

The two places that this series truly fails is in terrible direction with constant switches of camera angle and shot - sometimes quite literally every time a character speaks in a conversation we switch (not pan, switch) to a new camera and the constant 'jumping' this creates actually serves to destroy the narrative.

The second fail, whether direction or production I don't know, is in the constant, irritating and intrusive music. Sometimes the music track is so loud it is actually louder than the conversation or action that it is supposedly underlaying and not dominating! Do we need the constant, loud drone of rap music throughout every fight?

Overall a good series, it IS entertaining even if the writers have made Black Lightning into a ""woe is me"" wimp without the conviction of his principles or the inner strength to be the hero. Lightning and Thunder, the two daughters, are much better heroes.

Give it a chance but 'The Flash' or 'Arrow' it isn't, which is a shame."
Black Lightning,Tried to like it. Struggled. Failed.,"I'm black, and of an age where I was hugely into superhero and comic book culture from back in the day. And now seeing these stories brought to the screen, makes me more happy than you can know. With the high production values of Black Panther, and Luke Cage before it (I preferred Luke Cage actually), I was hoping for more of the same with Black Lightning. Instead, I tried to be loyal because at least I am represented as a black person on screen. But I didn't like the characters. Some were just jarring. The acting often seemed wooden.

It aims for grittiness, but it doesn't come across as gritty. It comes across as some very disinterested actors earning a quick buck, in something that they don't truly believe in."
Black Lightning,Why isn't there a laugh track?!,"I can't believe there is *anyone* happy with this show. Talk about setting the bar low! lol It is blatant ridiculing - can't you see that?!

Yes, if there was a laugh track added to every episode, it would make more sense, and I'd give it a higher rating."
Black Lightning,Great but could be better,"I'm not here to hate but it is significant to know this isn't the best show out there, it is great but it's not the best. Hollywood is fairly new to the whole diversity thing so it's interesting to look at how they take on issues as sensitive as police brutality, racism ingrained in the justice system and gang violence. The show could definitely be so so much better but as of yet I haven't seen anything very eye-catching and the story line seems uncertain and predictable."
Black Lightning,CW has hit the mark with BLACK LIGHTNING,"Most new TV series these days have the same lame formula, not this one.

Black Lightning Episode 1 gave me chills, thrills and a realism that most TV just does not have these days. It is current, topical, political and has all the elements of a great superhero series. I was hesitant to watch it but was so glad that I did.

Teenage social media and Smartphone addiction, gangs of disaffected youth in a society that doesn't care and Police that behave as a law unto themselves, it's like real life on the screen with zero MSM rubbish. These are the serious issues affecting not just America but every 5 eyes Western nations today.

A bit heavy on the family drama but all necessary to the plotline. Really excited to see more of this however knowing The CW, this will be lucky to make it past season One, as all their good shows fail to do. The flashbacks to the past are few and only appear where needed. Clever editing, good script and decent special effects. This show deserves a 9/10"
Black Lightning,I really kind of like it,I'm up to season 3 and I kind of like it. If you treat it like a visual and audio representation of a comic book (like 1980's era) then it's exactly right.
Black Lightning,I dont get it,So many good series get cancelled after 1 season and this crap gets 3 seasons. Incredible!
Black Lightning,Black Power Literally.... Lol.,"This is not great but its good... and its better than a lot of other shit out there. Im only giving it a 10 because it seems to have caused a lot of butthurt in the white american community... Im white, but I aint American, so I can enjoy this show without the guilt...Lol... Check it out for yourself."
Black Lightning,best DC tv show ever,Comentario no disponible
Black Lightning,How can this series have 6.4???,"Bad acting, weird fighting scenes, the main caracter is a well known principal at a high school and all he wear is a litte mask and then nobody recognize him. There are so many good series out there, dont waste time on this crap."
Black Lightning,Black Lightning Premier - More Then Stereotypes - Lays The Groundwork,Comentario no disponible
Black Lightning,I had hopes for this show,"Ell I hoped season 2 would be better than season 1, but it turned out being just as bad. I do not think the top critics even watch the show because I can't figure out why they give it such high marks. When compared to the ratings form all the other superhero shows, it's on the bottom."
Black Lightning,Easily dismissable,"Bad acting, bad stories, bad everything. I watched the entire first season hoping things would get better, but they didn't. Trying to play off the success of Marvel's Luke Cage, black lightning falls short at every turn. It wants to be a drama, it wants to be action, it wants to be a super hero show, but it isn't any of that. It's just loud noise throwing every black social issue at you possible. I am a black man and I felt this was just too much all at once. How it has lasted 3 seasons baffles me. Maybe the cw needs to have a ""black"" show since every other show barely has us on it, but this shouldn't be what they go with.

You can tell how bad they even think this show is because they didn't include him in their week long crossover event until his third season (tho he didn't get an entire episode for his show) yet batwoman did in her first season. Just saying."

Dragons: Rescue Riders,Good for kids,"It's a typical kid show and even though the animation style is different compared to the other Dragons shows and movies, it does not disappoint and looks entertaining for kids below 10 and die-hard fans of the HTTYD series like me."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,How to train your dragon goes paw patrol,Absolutly brilliant for 4 to 8 year olds. My kids absolutely love it. I hope they make more!
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Little kids only,Comentario no disponible
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Good clean fun,"My kids (and me) were big fans of the movies.

This is a great series and good fun (although being Scottish, I find the accents a bit tough to swallow :0)."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Good for young viewers,"I like the series, but this, not so much. I do not have young kids at home and do not care if a story is spin-off material as long as it is good. It would be nice to have this show where the last movie left off. A new generation of riders in New Berk. This show misses the mark with me and hoping for something better."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Give us MORE!,"Just finished all the episodes with my family. So great to have something new to watch. Loving the cute dragons. Can not wait for more. Need toys too, can't watch season 2 without fun toys to play with!

The Sick Day episode is our favorite. Very clever and fun episodes we all enjoyed."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,BORING,Comentario no disponible
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Great attention to detail! Impressive! An entire family favorite!,"Very impressed by the spinoff to HTTYD series. I'm usually an observer, but felt compelled to write a review based on our experience and the comments I have read since this was announced.

First and foremost, thank you for making a series the little ones can relate to and the parents don't have to worry about what they are watching. Your detail to the characters, with the expressions to the adorable freckles is fantastic. The dragon scales and attention to detail of each different dragon is quite beautiful and yet simple for a little one to grasp.

I have been appalled at the rude comments all over the internet regarding this show. The fact that Dreamworks themselves created this with Emmy award winning producers, who have worked on HTTYD, and yet ""fans"" of the franchise are complaining. This is FOR little kids, but enjoyable for the adults as well. From the animation, to the clever and humorous dialogue, there is something for everyone. This series is BASED on the original books, something a true fan can appreciate. It's time we all respect the fact that the younger generation doesn't need to be desensitized by violence and foul language to enjoy GOOD entertainment.

I am also quite impressed with the young voice cast. There is some true talent there. I don't understand why the talent isn't highlighted much as I think we would genuinely enjoy hearing their experience on what seemed to have been a lengthy production. My littles would love to see some live footage or even attend a meet and great with the cast.

Favorite moments: how the team works together, what trouble they get in or out of, and the valuable lessons are a bonus. Humor and continuity is gold! Cast superb!

Not so favorite: NO TOYS? my 4 year old already added all the characters to her Santa List!! Also , When they are flying to the Roost, it looks static, would love to have seen that change up a bit.

All in all, great show, great message, amazing characters and enjoyable episodes. Highly recommend. And if you are a colleague, a friend or family with littles, you're getting this or a Netflix membership for Christmas from my family."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Fast food tv,"If the How to Train You Dragon movies were Michelin Star restaurants (which they aren't but let's use that as the ground-level tier we're striving for here), this is a gas station microwave burrito.

This cheap offshoot bares only the most superficial resemblance to the How to Train Your Dragon movies. At no point are the movies or the characters in them referenced. This series connects to them only in that it has dragons and what passes in US culture for ""vikings"" in it. The morals are heavy handed, exposition is overused, and the stories are retread.

However, if your child likes talking dragons and vaguely Norse characters, they will love it. It's cheap but easily digested fare with generally uplifting themes and messaging."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,It's spectacular,I loved it. It's cool that we have something new for a change
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Great show,My 4yo daughter loves this show. She has seen the entire series at least 20 times. Not exagerating.
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Love love love this,This show is amazing!!! Please make a film and toys
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Boys 4 & 6 love it!,Rare with a series that both of my boys can watch together and ENJOY without any scary secenes.
Dragons: Rescue Riders,It's a fun and great show for all.,"Dragons Rescue Riders is a fun and lovable show for everyone. It's sad to see how much hate it gets just because it's not How to Train Your Dragon. It should be judged by the show that it is not compared to a series we all know and love. I would recommend this to families because I feel like I could watch it with the whole family. I rate it 10/10, I love Rescue Riders."
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Good Children's program for preschool age kids,Good Children's program with messages of kindness and acceptance.
Dragons: Rescue Riders,Fantastic show for little kids,"My three year old loves it and the quality of the writing is high enough that us parents don't mind watching it either!

Very nice animation to look at, especially the texture of the dragons scales and facial expressions. Great voice acting too by the young cast."

Well-Intended Love,Fundamental relationship problems,"Suspending disbelief is difficult when the CEO is also allowed by the police to act as a detective and go along with them and, of course finding, analyzing critical data.

However, the biggest problem with this show is a lack of understanding of relationships. You can't build a relationship on an abusive, possessive basis. Nor can someone, in this case the CEO, fundamentally change his personality so quickly.

SPOILER: The CEO's family owns a hospital so he is able to fake medical records indicating the objective of his desire (definitely not love) has leukemia and he is the only compatible donor.

Then, he gives her many rules to obey and, at one point, actually holds her captive. He treats her as a possession.

How in the world can a loving relationship be built on these fundamental misunderstandings of the difference between love and lust? Then we are to believe he quickly controls these destructive tendencies and real love comes out of this?

I couldn't suspend enough disbelief in the basis of this show and I think I am being generous with a 6 rating. While not everything is awful, I also found the bad guy, someone worse than the protagonist, to be a caricature of evil with no redeeming qualities. A bit too extreme in today's entertainment where I expect most characters to be a mix of good and bad."
Well-Intended Love,It's good but..,"This drama is addicting, although very typical business drama themed. The only issue i have is people wearing the same clothes wayy to much? As if they had a low budget. Even the rich business lead had to wear the same suit a couple of time. Although the acting is a bit insincere and akward because asians are usually head on with emotions, i'll give it a pass. Kissing was weird af, needs more passion."
Well-Intended Love,Not a K-Drama,"I admit when I first started watching this I thought it was a K-Drama as it appeared on my list on Netflix and I just assumed it was without even checking - what do I know - I am from the US and just read the subtitles and didn't even know what language it was. I felt it was a little off from the K-Dramas and after looking up the characters found the main stars were Chinese. I watched anyway mostly because it had 2 seasons so thought it must be good if they gave it another season. As it turns out the 2nd season was the same story as the first season, done with the same characters but focusing on a totally different pathway and adventures, with a different viewpoint so from that prospective it was different as well. I agree with one of the other reviews I read - I gave my rating for the male star who was handsome, and I liked the Idol actor as well. I definitely liked the ending on the second season better."
Well-Intended Love,Love love love it!,Just binge watched it ... I hope there's more soon!
Well-Intended Love,Not fitting for this day and age,"I have to say that it is not that I don't like the actors or characters, but everything about this movie screams #metoo. I know I should suspend belief and it's a fictional movie, but everything about this is what's wrong with Hollywood and it's view of 'romance' and 'consent'.

First off, I actually do like the main characters. My problem is the process in which they intend on building this 'love story' on. Yizhou is monosyllabic and expects the woman to read his mind or possibly understand his way of flirting. He's a business man and gets his way. So women are supposed to be attracted to that. We're supposed to like that he doesn't listen to what she wants or says. It's done over and over and it's really disturbing. Xia Lin just brushes it off every time. Like all women are supposed to do.

This is not to say he's disrespectful to her. But things like planning to share a room and being naked when she's obviously uncomfortable isn't right. This is how you woo a woman? Even though she is your wife on paper, it's not okay. They signed on for a fake marriage. If he wants to change that then he should speak up. Not play games with her and try to woo her when she's just trying to honor her end of the deal. As well, praying on the vulnerability of a woman who is supposedly sick so she can get well, is really despicable. They did really make it seem like she isn't sick so it's okay because she can make rational decisons this way?

I want to like this show, but this alone makes it hard to like it at all. It makes it difficult for me to root for the couple we're supposed to like."
Well-Intended Love,First Season Was Good,"I really liked the first season of this show, however I don't like how the second season started there love journey from the beginning. I was kinda confused."
Well-Intended Love,Love it,"I looove this show. Can't stop watching and I will re-watch it again, I know it."
Well-Intended Love,Not bad but acting is crap,The story has couple of twist that makes it interesting but the story is not a real drama in life and the acting is killing me super super super bad!
Well-Intended Love,Love,I like this show it's pretty good couldn't stop watching it when I first seen It on Netflix
Well-Intended Love,The insanity of some of the script,"Good day producers, I believe honestly too much unnecessary drama...the writer needs to go back to the drawing board. The chief problem I have with it is that it is not practical, I sincerely hope that they can change the way they do things in the future."

Well-Intended Love,Great entertainment,"One of the reasons I like this series so much is because I'm comparing it to the usual, predominate, filth and perversion that American entertainment offers. Check out what's playing on IFC, the Independent Film Channel, or many of the other popular channels and you will, hopefully, appreciate clean wholesome stories like this. Even the BBC is now becoming infamous for taking well-known stories and retelling them in a way that you wouldn't want your children to see. So yes, two big thumbs up, and it's not as if I speak Mandarin, I have to read the dialog and sometimes pause or rewind but it's worth it."
Well-Intended Love,It's alright,"Not the best show ever. But enjoyable. There were a lot I didn't like about it. Nothing against the actors they all did a great job. Just the storyline was a little much, lots of unbelievable things but okay. Still if you want a show to past the time this one will probably do. Not the greatest but worth a watch. And you'll be happy with the ending."
Well-Intended Love,Love it,"Amazing, so much drama, heart ache and mystery! Such a romantic love story! 100% recommend."
Well-Intended Love,How does this even has a high rating?!,"The acting is terrible, I bet the high scores in here are because of the male lead is good looking and his looks are basically what carries this show, but even his looks can't save how annoying and how bad the female lead's acting is. The script is terrible as well, a woman faking being sexually harassed and then a lady threatening to kill herself to get what she wants all within the first episode? Horrible. To not even go too far away, two minutes into the series the characters jump in what I would call the worst edited car ride I've ever seen, the ride scene is clearly recorded on a green screen with a scenery on the background that literally repeats itself for about 3-5 minutes. And the interior of the car is so fake and bad edited is impossible to believe this was filmed in China with all the high tech they claim to have.

If you wanted an honest review this is it, don't waste your time with this one."
Well-Intended Love,Again,I have seen it again and I still love it - this will not be my last one
Well-Intended Love,Do Yourself a Favor....,"I am so disappointed. This is one of the worst C dramas I've ever watched. The plot, the actors, the premise and the directing of this story were all terrible! I cannot believe it was extended to a second season, it is the same kooky story repeated. There is no chemistry between the lead male and female actors, it's just more of the same inane nonsense. Do yourself a favor - skip this drama."
Well-Intended Love,A lot of fun!,"Sure, this isn't the best Asian drama of all time, but it's a LOT of fun and it's actually the show that got me into Asian dramas in the first place! So props there.

It's super funny and cheesy and the actors are attractive (especially Xu Kaicheng). I love all the romance tropes in it--they're all super cute. The production quality is really good, even if there is a LOT of product placement in season 2.

I like the premise of the show: how their love transcends different ""alternate universes,"" if you will.

The action scenes with the bad guys are super silly, but I think this show should be considered more of a rom-com and less of a drama.

Season 1 is definitely stronger than season 2, but I didn't even expect it to get a season 2 so I'm just happy there's a season 2.

The side ships are all super cute and ship-worthy in this and I just wanna give Chu Yan a hug the entire time <3

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the sillier-type kdramas."
Well-Intended Love,Great quarantine binge!,"My mom found this on Netflix one late night, she started the first two episodes and then hooked me in!!! We're almost done bingeing all of Season 1 which is super long but I love having so many episodes, it's the best!!! The main characters and supporting friend characters all draw you in! There's love, comedy, so much DRAMA, mystery, thrills... everything you could want in one show! Once you immerse yourself in their world you just have to keep watching to see what's going to happen next!"

How to Get Away with Murder,How to Get Away with Legal Inaccuracy,"I saw at least 3 other reviews of this TV show that put it at a 6/10 for the sole reason that it is an inaccurate portrayal of lawyers. Yes, and...? Does that take away from the brilliant plot and acting? I don't think anything in film or television is an accurate portrayal of anything. If someone were to rewrite this exciting show into an ""accurate portrayal"" of law, then it would just be a show about Viola Davis filling out paper work and occasionally showing up in court. And some of these reviewers go on to say that it is a shame that people believe that is how the court of law is in real life. My advice to them is to go to the IMDb page of the Avengers and write a review that says, ""it's a shame that every single person who watches this movie now believes superheroes actually exist,"" because apparently no one who is a consumer of media entertainment has the common sense to know that lawyers do not, in reality, go around killing and bribing everyone.

No one watches a show like How to Get Away with Murder for a lesson in law, they watch it for the interesting characters and fascinating plot. I had to write this review to correct all of the mistaken reviews that gave this show anything less than a 7, because the overall rating of this show was dismaying to me. And to learn it is for such a irrelevant reason!"
How to Get Away with Murder,Ridiculous and gay and pretty awesome,"If you want to watch yet another procedural about lawyers that's realistic or even researched in any way this is not the show for you. However if you want an over the top, melodramatic, sexy, unpredictable show that'll keep you guessing and laughing and freaking out with every cliffhanger, then watch this.

Viola Davis is amazing (unsurprisingly) and Analise is one of the most interesting main characters on TV right now.

This show had one of the best pilots I've seen in a while and the season 2 premiere was one of the best episodes of television I've seen all year (and I watch A LOT of TV).

In summary, How To Get Away With Murder is kinda dumb, kinda funny, really engaging and enthralling and constantly surprising."
How to Get Away with Murder,"Loved It, Then Hated It, Now I Love To Hate It: A Lawyer's Tale","At the time of writing, I have seen all of season one and the first episode of season 2.

I've seen other reviews on here that talk about how impossible it is to watch this show if you have any legal knowledge, and I would just like to add my two cents to this topic. I sympathize. I'm a lawyer, and have worked in criminal defence (once upon a time), and I, too, generally have a really hard time watching any legal dramas whatsoever. Television takes egregious liberties with the justice system, and shows that portray the practice of law are difficult to watch when they are wildly inaccurate, and it is frustrating to witness protagonists do things that you know are illegal or unethical. As annoying as this is, the tendency is understandable—even criminal law is only so compelling in real life. The assumption is that most viewers do not have legal training, and that nobody—lawyers included—will watch a show where competent, ethical practitioners stay at the office late looking up cases on Quicklaw, fiddling with binding machines, and trying not to smudge pad thai sauce on their prelim transcripts.

This show, however, is so ridiculous that it actually rose to the level of suspension of disbelief required for me, at least, to still enjoy it. It is basically a soap opera. Trying to subject it to human logic is a pointless exercise that will inevitably leave you discombobulated, shouting at the sky about injustice or whatever people do once they've discovered their whole life is a lie.

For instance, I would be hard pressed to conceive of a more profound conflict of interest than that contained in the season 1 episode 10 court scene if someone bet me $100 and a case of beer (I won't describe it in the interests of no spoilers--the blame-shifting thing). And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Every other thing that every character does in this show would get you summarily disbarred, fired, or charged with something.

At the end of the day however, that is not the point. This show seems to know exactly how over-the-top it is. But rather than trying to scale back the insanity in the name of realism, it revels in knocking it right into twelfth gear. Left and right, people are lying to each other or the court, sleeping around and committing felonies—sometimes at the same time—because why not? The degree of accuracy is so low that the mercury drops out the bottom of the thermometer and creates a rift in the space-time continuum. It fails so hard it wins. It is the Hearts equivalent of shooting the moon.

So get some popcorn and get comfy. Try to resist the analytical voice in your head that keeps screaming ""No!"" and just let it wash over you. Everything will be fine."
How to Get Away with Murder,FINALLY A SHOW THAT GAVE PROPER CLOSURE,A show that ended properly in a long time even though their makeup was terrible 😂.but loved it and will always leave a impact on me MUST WATCH!.
How to Get Away with Murder,Among Network TV's best dramas,"I have no idea why it has taken me this long to write a review for this show since I have loved it since day 1. Meanwhile, How to Get Away With Murder has become my favorite show on television, and here's why: Even in a golden age of television, network TV has been lacking original content in the last few years. There are too many procedural dramas and too many superhero shows, so therefore I am glad to have a show like HTGAWM. Yes, it is partly a legal drama, but it is definitely so much more than than. IMO it is primarily a mystery and a thriller at the same time because every season starts with an intriguing flash-forward, showing us a very dramatic event that takes place in their mid-season finale. However, when most shows have flash-forwards they only feature one in the premiere and practically have no build-up to it, HTGAWM does the opposite, it features a flash-forward in every one of the first 8 episodes of a season and plays with our mind. By the time you have watched the mid-season finale itself, your mind will be blown. But why am I telling you this? Because I am trying to underline that this show has the most brilliant and shocking twists you could even imagine, and they have about 100 of those. They are executed with such brilliance and complexity that you will never get bored or annoyed by them. What is probably even better than the brilliant twists, however, is the masterful acting. Viola Davis nails every single scene she is, she portrays this deeply flawed character beautifully with so much depth. I cannot praise her enough, she deserves every single award that exists. That is not to say that the supporting cast is any less mesmerizing, they all bring their A-game consistently. They all deserve recognition. And one last thing: character development!!!! So so brilliant! The characters that you meet in the pilot change a lot as time passes and they all become very three-dimensional! Just go ahead and watch this show. I could say so much more, but just go enjoy the fun and crazy ride. You won't regret it, I promise!"
How to Get Away with Murder,One of the best shows I've ever watched,I honestly can say that this is one of the absolute best TV shows I've ever watched. I feel like they are my family! I'm going to be so sad when it ends.
How to Get Away with Murder,Freaking Amazing,"I honestly think the other review was uncalled for. This is fantastic! The beginning is a little confusing and hard to figure out whats going on but honestly, that's what makes it so suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Most crime shows are all about justice, which is great but sometimes it's nice to see the opposite side of things. There's so many dynamic characters in this show, it adds interest. Viola Davis is amazing in this. She's such a strong actress and her acting is very believable and on point. What I will say is, some of the characters seem a bit awkward. Again, I think that's what makes it interesting. The awkward characters have a place and don't seem like a random actress throw into the mix. I find this show, sexy, interesting and very dramatic. It's the perfect mix! I say give it a watch, if you don't like it no harm, no foul."
How to Get Away with Murder,I Love This Show,"I know that some people don't like the outlandish schemes of this show and say that the legal parts and law school parts are ""unrealistic"" but that's the point of the show! Nobody wants to watch a show about the real lives of law students, they're just not that interesting. The reason that these shows are popular is because they are crazy, and lots of people like that. There's nothing wrong with that. If you don't like the drama, then don't watch this show, because yes, it is unrealistic. But that's what makes it interesting! Please just stop hating on it because realistic everyday lives aren't all that interesting to watch unless they're comedy and some people like drama because we are humans and we simply want the drama. We want those lives because they're exciting, regardless of how unrealistic they are. I LOVE THIS SHOW. It's so interesting and I love finding out what happens next. The acting is amazing and the story lines are very creative. It's really good and I highly recommend it."
How to Get Away with Murder,twisty storytelling wears out over time,"Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) is a sought-after law professor and a famous hard-charging defense attorney willing to push the envelope. She selects her students Wes Gibbins, Connor Walsh, Michaela Pratt, Asher Millstone, and Laurel Castillo as her interns to work on her cases. There is Annalise's husband Sam and her secret affair with police detective Nate Lahey. There are her associates Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom. The first season centered on the murder of student Lila Stangard and Rebecca Sutter who is the main suspect.

This is Shondaland. The flashforward structure of the first season is challenging but kept the show different and interesting. There is nothing better than Viola Davis. She shines but she also overpowers the younger cast. The biggest overshadowed problem is Alfred Enoch who is most known for a minor Harry Potter role. He's not alone in that problem. It doesn't help that the storytelling is non-stop twists and turns. The characters never get the stability needed to build chemistry. The second season centers on a different case and by the third season, I have to give up. All the effort is used to keep up with the twisty stories. Only Viola Davis is able to break through. It's just really tough to remember the situations for each character over the years."
How to Get Away with Murder,Fun!,I just binge watched season one and I loved it. First off I want to say that there are a bunch of complaining critics on here that I think are missing the point of the show. How to get away with murder. It's not a show that's going to depict total reality. It's a fun to watch exaggerated clever show (but there's a bit of truth behind every bit of this exaggeration). Maybe the critics that rate the show so harshly should really watch it with a grain of salt. So many are saying that it's unrealistic. The law schools are not at all like this. Law isn't practiced like this. Oh grow up. The crazy twisting corrupted lying cheating goings-on are exaggerated and accelerated to make it more fun to watch. This is a fun show and I am most certainly looking forward to season two. Now I will agree that there are some gratuitous sex scenes that just really aren't necessary. The writers really don't have to spell it out for us. We get it. Maybe they will ease up on that kind of stuff in season two. Good show and I recommend it to people who are open-minded to the fact that TV doesn't always have to be based on true absolute reality. It's supposed to be entertaining. And this show is definitely entertaining.
How to Get Away with Murder,Dissappointed,"I started watching this show as it was recommended highly and also had good online ratings. I REALLY enjoyed it at first but halfway through the season it started feeling tedious. Things got convoluted & started to get unreal. I was REALLY dissappointed at the end of season 1, so I won't be continuing to watch."
How to Get Away with Murder,Good start,This starts out well but then all the characters just get annoying because they are all deviant in behavior. There is no balance.
How to Get Away with Murder,"Brilliant writing, brilliant acting!",Comentario no disponible
How to Get Away with Murder,Messy and addictive,"This is a story about a law professor and her inner circle of students, collegues, lovers and friends who each season find themselves involved in a murder and use their legal knowledge to cover up their crimes.

Sounds distasteful? It very much is. It's messy, ugly, upsetting - and totally brilliant!

The entire cast is phenomenal. Viola Davis in particular brings magic to every scene she's in, and it's impossible to imagine anyone else playing Professor Annalise Keating.

While the series pushes the limits for how many murders we're supposed to accept that our little group of anti-heroes gets involved in, the story is a dramatic rollercoaster that I couldn't get enough of. I binged every season. This series feels so fresh that you can't really compare it to any other show."
How to Get Away with Murder,Slow at the start but Awesome all- in- all,"The most interracial show ever made, seems to be the main theme of the serial. But the plot takes the cherry. The twists through out the story is simply hypnotizing. Even though it is slow at the start, the end pays it off with interest.It seems to have been made with a message of women, gay and other empowerment and is not at all subtle about it. It has Gay sex in every episode..that girls might love. But all these negative points are well outweighed by the the story-line plus acting. Majorly the actor in the lead role ""Anna Keating"". Her work is impeccable. I can't remember the last time I failed to identify the killer beforehand. The director would amaze everyone with the brilliant work. ""How to get away with murder"" there could not be a better title than this.So, watch it right now, bear first few episodes with patience, then drown in its magic. Great Show!!"
How to Get Away with Murder,Wow this show keeps getting better season after season!,"I enjoyed this show from the start of the season and rated it 8/10.

Then as the episodes and seasons progressed, I got annoyed with the constant back and forth timelines - of which I felt were confusing and unnecessary. Thus I dropped my score down to a 7.

Well, now into season 4, these timeline flashbacks and flash forwards are making sense and getting better.

The tension of this show is intense and Viola Davis has found her role - nails it season after season. I want her character to be my friend and mentor lol.

Score is now up to a 9.5 rounded up to a 10/10."
How to Get Away with Murder,Hooked from the beginning to the end,"I binged the entire four seasons in under a month. All of the characters are so interesting - you love and hate all of them at one point or another. It's an emotional rollercoaster - I cried A LOT! I love how each episode has its own story, but there is always a thread of flashbacks or flashforewards that keep you hooked until the end of each season. This is not a series you can just have on in the background - you really need to be giving it your full attention to appreciate its brilliance. Couldn't recommend it enough!"
How to Get Away with Murder,The type of Mystery Show that keeps you hooked,"The show is very thrilling and written in a very smart way. What I love about this show, is that they constantly make sure your mind is blown. The show keeps alternating between present scenes and future scenes which makes you very thrilled to know how can this character become this character and do these stuff, and by the end of the season, the present scenes and future scenes merge into one another in a very professional way that does not get you confused as to what happened. Every episode they give you a clue and show you one more thing about the story, which is great for me really, because I hate waiting for seasons and seasons to know stuff, and then get shocked that they canceled the show, or no questions were answered because the directors forgot details that happened all together. They let you know a lot each episode, but still not enough, only to get you hooked. The actors are absolutely great, each character displays a completely different personality than the other, but somehow they complete each other.

Excellent Series. Excellent Script. Excellent Director and absolutely excellent actors."
How to Get Away with Murder,I don't usually use the term guilty pleasure...,"This is definitely a time to use it. Unlike other ABC shows I used to watch like Desperate Housewives, I never heard a good word about HTGAWM. When Desperate Housewives first appeared there were plaudits and comparisons with Six Feet Under and Sex & The City. Much like DH, this show centres on a mystery (who killed Lila Stangart and how are the main characters going to get away with murder?). Add to that some of the horniest students and professionals I've seen on television since Queer as Folk, you've got a great mix of intrigue, hysteria and mystery. It doesn't pretend to be a good show. It's overblown, it's riddled with over-acting, the plot is paper thin and the court scenes are like cheap episodes of ""The Good Wife."" And it works in the shows favour. It's so good because it never once puts on the front of being a good television show. It's trashy and dirty and Viola Davis is absolutely amazing. If you're needing to wind down after a hard day of actual work, tune in to How To Get Away With Murder and enjoy the petty dramas of an oversexed, over-thinking, overdressed cast. The jury is out - How To Get Away With Murder is guilty! Guilty of being pleasurable."
How to Get Away with Murder,A show that never fails to surprise.,"This TV show is very well written and has the viewer on the edge of her seat for 43 minutes. I have loved every episode so far, and I really like the characters. Plot twists are, according to me, fantastic. And this show has a lot of them. It never fails to surprise. Law is something I have always found fascinating - you get a new case every week and you get to follow Annalise and her students into court while also getting a glimpse into everyone's personal lives. The characters are alike in many ways, but also very unique. You get to see the relationships between the students, between the adults - and of course, between the students and adults. I have always been a big fan of Shonda, she will continue to do great things."
How to Get Away with Murder,Reasonably ok...,"Glorified soap opera...Personally,i would like to see more in depth study of interesting criminal cases ,instead of mostly family,love,gay drama...nevertheless ,ok time killer..."
How to Get Away with Murder,My soul feels polluted,"So much nastiness! This show got worse and worse with each season. Sexy, sad and nasty people consistently lie, cheat, scheme and hurt each other, and wonder why they're so miserable. There's not one redeemable character in the series."
How to Get Away with Murder,It's simply everything you want from a TV series,"It's the epitome of TV perfection.

With intricate twists, fresh narratives, and multi-dimensional characters, this series keeps you hooked.

Surprises in every episode, from shocking reveals to character arcs, blend suspense with satisfaction.

It's a benchmark in TV excellence, captivating with seamless storytelling, stellar performances, and stunning visuals.

This show lingers in your mind, sparking conversations and theories.

Amidst a sea of options, it shines as a binge-worthy masterpiece that'll keep you enthralled.

I really don't know what to watch now that I've just finished ""How to Get Away with a Murder"""
How to Get Away with Murder,must to watch,"For me this series was a rollercoaster. It made me feel angry, sad, happy and proud. I had a great time of watching it that it made me realize a lot about my current life style. I recommend this series for whose who are trying to find the movie which will give them the whole spector of emotions and joy. I give it 10/10 as it made me feel that once it seems to be over, there might be another path.

P.s. Thanks my dearest friend maria who recommended me this and made me a junkie who waits for another free moment to enjoy his doze. For me it was another episode of How to get away with the murder."
How to Get Away with Murder,Brilliant performances,"If you are into courtroom battles, injustices and scandals then this is the series. It centres around a professor/defense attorney "" Annalise"" played by the remarkable Viola Davis who teaches first term wannabe law students in the ins and outs of law and many, many trials and tribulations. Certain students are selected to assist Annalise in the day to day investigating of cases that turn up sometimes deadly consequences.

There is a certain "" Breaking Bad"" sequence where future circumstances and scenes are played, this really adds to a well written and played out series.

Rated this 9/10 only because, and my only issue is the complexities of this series cannot be binged watched, and sometimes the outcome of some cases do get predictable, but genuinely in no way does it spoil the whole series.

Again Viola Davis, along with Billy Brown, Aja Naomi King, Liza Weil and Karla Souza really stand out, make this great viewing."

Mortel,A hidden gem of a show.,I just discovered this hidden on Netflix. It is not a groundbreaking television show that you must see but it is definitely worth your time. I enjoyed the mix of the superhero with the supernatural genre. It delved into some interesting complexities surrounding myths and the type of human fortitude it takes to overcome your deepest fears.
Mortel,Maybe if you have NOTHING else to watch,"I thought it was just ok. There's a lot going on with little explanation and it's very disjointed. I guess I kept watching out of curiosity. Like one person said, it's not terrible. No, but it certainly isn't awesome."

Mortel,I binged watched the whole season.....,"And I loved every minute of it! Everything from the acting to the subdued use of special effects, the entire production overflowed with creativity and nuance, made by a team of people who actually cared about the story they were attempting to tell. French language programming has been hitting it out of the park lately, and I really appreciate just how many risks are being taken with these types of series. Overall, an extremely well done show that anyone with a passing interesting in good television should watch.

Highly recommended!"
Mortel,Music,"Not bad but the terrible choice of incidental ""music"" ruined it. As that genre of ""music"" ruins everything."
Mortel,I literally don't understand what's going on,"It's not horrible, I kinda get what it should be about, but it just goes way off topic all the time and has scenes that just make no sense, it's like the writers didn't even understand what they were writing."
Mortel,Not your average heroes,"Mortal is a strange kinda super power series and I love it! The teen characters are unique, strong, endearing, fun and crazy. The writers may have written a teen focused script on a high school campus but adults will enjoy this series too! The adult characters round the series out. The voodoo grandma is hella funny with her craft. Main characters Sofiane and Victor take the cake. Polar opposites but their relationship/friendship is interesting to watch evolve as they discover their respective powers and emotional balance. The evil character Obe is interesting. More like unique. The eyewear worn looks more like frames with fire coils for lenses. I had no intention of binging this Netflix series but I was hooked. The series highlights a lot of the confusion, emotional turmoil and rollercoaster decisions that is representative of the teen years. In the final episode there is redemption, healing, resolve & forgiveness. There's also closure of old wounds and the start of new beginnings. The hallway scene between Luisa and Victor is exquisite sweet perfection. The moment is mind blowing. Worthy of a cigarette 🚬 afterwards. A solid series well written. 10 stars for creativity, great cast, action and storyline."
Mortel,"Different, but that doesn't mean anything","Recently i've been watching tv shows and movies from another countries outside ""Hollywood"" predictable scripts.

I like Mortel, mostly the sounds tracks the fits the characters.

But... It's another show based on dumb decisions playing the role, this isn't different from the KATLA show, recently released on netflix too.

Seens to me that all this shows keep rolling based on dumb teenagers decisions, and that's disapointing."
Mortel,"I...""watched"" it","A whole lotta nonsense that ended up being background noise that I listened to, it's not awful though."
Mortel,give it the chance it deserves!,It just gets better! I binged out on one day and want more. It ended up being a beautifully done show.
Mortel,What the heck was this!?,"What the heck was this!? I mean, I knew it was going to be different from American movies, and I'm 100% okay with that, I watch Bollywood and many other movies/shows from different countries, but this one was pretty awful, like wow haha the ""rapper"" bad guy was laughable."
Mortel,A good supernatural show,"Three episodes in. I am really enjoying this. Being a teen supernatural show, I did not have any expectations, but the show is really good with good twists and turns. Acting is not a strong suit of the show. Also, if you like strong moral protagonists in the show, then this is not the show for you. All the characters are mostly a**h***s. Tighter screenplay and better handling of the characters would have helped immensely. All in all, a good supernatural show. Will edit later, after I finish the whole series. It is only six episodes long. Edit: Completed it. A kind of cliche ending, but still not a bad one. Revised my rating to 8."
Mortel,A captivating Tvshow,"In my opinion Mortel is the most captivating french Tvshow In the suburb of Paris Sofiane tries to find his brother because he dissapeared. The performance of Nemo Schiffman is just incredible, he played hard scene and the duo with Carl Malapa is so great. The only problem of this Tvshow is that the characters except Sofiane and Victore are not developped like Luisa and the supervilain. I liked the different scenes and her different colors. The directors made a good job ! The soundtrack is just wonderful because the rapsongs used are the same as what I listen everyday. The plot was well written and I rate Mortel 8.5 stars. If you are a teenager and you like action romance and fantastic TVshow you will love Mortel !"
Mortel,S1 is much better than S2,"Season 1-The plot was good. This show got some funny scenes and some good twists . Concept was great too. Yet the final episode could've been better . Really loved the victor and sofiane performance. And the background music thing was on point. Don't know about negative reviews but I loved it . 7/10

Season 2 - This season was a huge let down for me . Especially the plot was so weak in this season . Idk about these fake reviews but this season disappointed me a-lot . It becomes so boring now. Expected so much from this show but the plot have really gone bad. Stay away from it. 3/10."
Mortel,Great show!,"Complex themes intertwined in a teen supernatural show. Suicide, sexual assault, friendship, familial expectations, loss, communication, and true love. The soundtrack is everything right with the world. The acting is nuanced with the exception of a couple of minor characters chomping sone scenery. It starts kind of slow but by the second episode you're hooked. This show contains one of the most beautiful love scenes I've ever witnessed. A must see! Please give us a2nd season,Netflix!"
Mortel,Truly Enjoyable,"It's fun, it's captivating, and generally a great show to binge."
Mortel,It gets better as you watch it ..,I loved this show ..at first I thought it sucked then I stayed with it .great character development ..just 6 episodes tho I NEED MORE
Mortel,Must see,Binge watched the whole show! Really great 👍🏽👍🏽
Mortel,Amusement,"I binged the whole season. I think it is actually really good and fun to watch. The story,special effects were all very good. Also the choice of music is a nice touch"
Mortel,Great show!,Loved the urban vibe to it. No big special effects. Everything is in the story. Great casting!
Mortel,*HIDDEN GEM!!!*,"I thoroughly enjoyed this show and watched it with English subtitles as I'm from the UK and do not speak French, but oh boy, it was so so good. I seriously did not expect to get hooked on it. The acting is great and convincing, the story is edgy and different and the way it all comes together really combines elements from other amazing fantasy/sci-fi shows. It's dark and gripping and touches upon taboo topics such as mental illness and certainly to me had a lot of metaphors laced throughout.

Just watch it, you'll thank me later!"
Mortel,Not what I was expecting.,"At first I thought it was going to be just another silly superhero movie but oh man I was so wrong.

It got me from the beggining until the end.

This show is worth your time! and I hope we get a second season for this."
Mortel,So much better than I expected,I'm not usually into foreign series' but with the option of English audio I thought I'd give it a go and I was pleasantly surprised. I binge watched it I two goes. I hope there's a second season!
Mortel,Binged in one night,"I watched this show dubbed and subbed it in English and LOVED IT. The development of the main characters is exceptional and the special FX are great. I will be forever disappointed if this story isn't followed up by more seasons. Highly recommend you check this show out, and make sure to leave yourself a few hours in case it's too good to stop!"
Mortel,Love It! Season 3 please!,"Love It! Season 3 please!

1st-- loved the soundtrack.

2nd-- I ship victor and luisa so hard 3rd -- really cool special effects 4-- Victor's ART!!!

5-- I lost my brother recently and Sofianes dedication and undying love for Reda hooked me.

6 the characters grew, matured, evolved in a way that reminds me of the stories our english teachers made us discuss and write papers on in school

Obe gave a fresh take on the villian. It was really hard to hate him in the way I've loved to loathe other bad guys.

For me Obe was Almost like an antihero. I felt bad for him and kind of came to understand his motives as they developed.

Overall, Mortel does a great job providing positive approaches to difficult situations that need attention in today's world.

To name a few: Human Trafficking, PTSD, child abuse, Stockholm syndrome, mental healthcare, addiction, emotional intelligence, respecting sexual boundaries.

Without feeling like a cheesy afterschool special ...Quite the opposite, It deals with some heavy undertones in an intelligent, digestible way.

I found the characters intensely relatable.

The range and depth of emotions the cast members displayed completely engulfed me into their world.

There was one 5 second scene where Manon Bresch's character --Luisa-- i expected her to show the anger, fear, and determination that appeared but then she briefly wore immense empathy towards Obe's situation totally drawing me deeper into the world with them.

I'm a weird person and Mortel was so wonderfully weird that I'm watching for the 3rd time through this weekend.

Love it."

Dinotrux: Supercharged,Where is the supercharge?,"A decent continuation of the franchise, but am up to the third episode and my 4 year old is getting deeply disappointed by the lack of supercharge. Not sure why it was so important it was worth renaming the series but not actually capitalise in the episodes. I suspect marketers who saw one promo image and wrote everything based on that."
First Team: Juventus,Fantastic insight,"Brisk but brilliant this currently six part series is a fantastic watch, featuring beautiful cinematography of the squads training regime and match action intercut between conferences, interviews etc. The series follows certain players individually away from the pitch over the course of the season as the club soars to success showing a more personal side of the stars. The general following of the course of the season creates a wonderfully tense narrative of hogs and lows allowing for a greatly effective style to shine through, highly recommend"
First Team: Juventus,Terrific season documentary,Really liked this. It was interesting to follow team over the season 2017-2018 set to beautiful views of Torino. I spent quite a lot of time in Torino ( I have a friend in Coassolo ) and it was great to see the views of the city and mountains. The players come across really well in particular Chiellini. I like him. The manager also. What a great manager. Of course the star was Gigi Buffon. Very absorbing series. Fantastic. Loved it. Sad it ended.
First Team: Juventus,Great for football fans,"It's showing us life of a football player, their dedication and anything you should know if you're a big Juventus fan. Why i gave 7 stars and not 10? Because it has just 1 season with 3 episodes."
First Team: Juventus,Inside look into an Elite Football (Soccer) Club,"Inside look into an Elite Football (Soccer) Club, showing the ups and downs, club traditions, even a glimpse into the personal lives of players.

definitely worth watching for anyone, even more for a football fan and a must for a Juventino"
First Team: Juventus,Mazing inside look for every football fan,"I love this title and am waiting for the next episodes to come out. I've always craved for a series, similar to the one on Liverpool, which shows the human side behind these stars, they're great commitment to the sport and of course their attachment to a huge club like Juventus...

I'm also happy they chose this team, because unlike other elite teams, Juventus is literally impregnated with history and tradition. Let us not forget that Juventu has been in the hands of the Agnelli family since 1923 when FIAT owner Edoardo Agnelli bought the club. It makes the family the longest lasting ownership in any sports franchise globally. It has an outstanding competent management and let's face it... it's a cool name.

I might have liked to see something about their scandal in 2006 behind the scenes. From what I read there was a second trial a couple of years later, in which the team was actually declared NOT guilty for most of the convictions. A little sad, that the media did not report these turn in the facts as it should... On the other hand, I understand maybe Juventus just wants to move on... Well, they're doing it greatly.

All in all, 10/10 for the series, can't wait for more episodes."
First Team: Juventus,Great watch for football (or Sports) fans in general,"First Team Juventus is a really thrilling and informative look at the inner workings and behind the scenes (the day to day lives) of one of European/World football's elite clubs: Juventus.

The story arc follows Juventus' 2017/2018 season and profiles a number of their players, both homegrown (Gigi Buffon,Georgio Chiellini) to their stellar imports (Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain, Juan Cuadrado, etc.).

Given the results of their 2017/2018 Champions League run thus far, it could prove to have a climactic second half of the (docuseries') season."
First Team: Juventus,Not great and more of an expensive sales pitch for Juve,"It's beautifully put together, really nice shots and some interesting insights in the personal life of the players, but I mostly think that it's just a big sales pitch of how big of a club Juventus is. Don't get me wrong. I like the club Juventus and the values they stand for, but it's just not it. There's no real insight in tactics, and it made me feel like it was all acting and nothing I saw was real. The commentary is an endless stream club values and is only there to add some unrealistic 'match of the century-'suspense before big games. During the 4th episode I couldn't handle the way it was told anymore. 5 stars for the way it was filmed."
First Team: Juventus,COULD HAVE BEEN SPECIAL,Sadly the passion and interest level found in Sunderland till I die is missing from this show. It's very well put together but doesn't quite hit the high levels needed. The narrators voice is strangely out of place in a sea of italian language. It might have been better to source a narrator with an italian accent speaking english to maintain that authenticity. watch a few episodes but you will soon get bored.

Into the Badlands,"The right balance between mystery, spectacular fights, humor and beauty","I'm currently watching season 3 on Prime and this series keeps on being captivating and highly entertaining. Nick Frost brings lightheartedness to an otherwise dark and bloody piece of art. There is no clear good or bad, but instead every character evolves, changes and fights with their own demons. Clearly great attention was given to the look & feel with beautiful fights that are like bloody dances with colourful and mesmerising backgrounds and beautiful people. Of course it's over the top, but that is what creates a world on its own, a world like in a fairy tale as gruesome as they were before Disney took the edge out of them. I love this series and am sad it was not continued."
Into the Badlands,Action Packed Series,"The best way to describe Into the Badlands in one word is...underrated. Like so many reviews have already pointed out here this show didn't get the respect it deserved when it was on tv. We're lucky to get the 3 seasons we did and they were able to finish the story in a respectable way but I read the writers had a few more seasons worth of story in them. It's about a boy with supernatural powers in a post-apocalyptic world that's territories are divided by barons. It's one of the rare shows where each seasons gets better and better. The story just draws you into their world and gets you hooked. The fighting, led by the incredibly underrated martial artist Daniel Wu, is just amazing. If you're a martial arts fan or a fan of action in general then give this show a try. You won't be disappointed."
Into the Badlands,Hey Iron Fist - this is how you make a martial arts show,"The love child of Mad Max and Ip Man mixed with an old school Western. This show is nothing like anything else, but there's something for everyone.

I'm not really a fan of steam punk, but this is very well done. High production value and slick choreography."
Into the Badlands,Save the badlands!!!,One of my favourite shows of all time I can't believe they're getting rid of it as it goes from strength to strength. The last season ended perfectly to set up for a game changing 4th season that I absolutely need to see. I pray somebody saves this great program.
Into the Badlands,Not for over-thinkers,"I get that people want this to be entirely believable and that aspects, such as the lack of guns in a world where other machines exist, appears to be hard to fathom - but think of all the other movies that have unbelievable components - such as why does Obe Wan wear a raggedy robe in a time when they can fly through space? He could still wear a robe, but did it have to look like a potato sack? How can Batman really compete with Superman, seriously?

Anyway the mix of martial arts with supernatural and post- apocalyptic themes would make most people think this is a horrible combination for a TV series ... but not if you are a fan of old Chinese martial arts movies.

The fight scenes in this movie are incredible considering it is made for television. The acting isn't absolutely stunning, but acting never was in many of those Chinese movies and it was never meant to be. The main characters Danny Wu and Martin Csokas both do a satisfactory job in their roles. Emily Beecham's portrayal of the Widow has grown on me and she looks really impressive in some of the fight scenes.

Some of the supporting actors, particularly the fighters, I admit leave a little to be desired acting wise, but generally ... you don't want them to do much more than lose.

I believe if you over think the reality of this TV series, you may miss some of the good aspects of it, but admittedly this type of show isn't for everyone.

Having just watched the first season, I loved the finale and am eagerly looking forward to seeing more."
Into the Badlands,Amazing choreographed fight scenes,"I love this show. The story is gripping and thrilling to watch unfold. But what's really amazing is the art of the show. The filming, choreography, wardrobes, lighting, music, everything is stunning. The fight scenes are always a highlight, always suspenseful, always beautiful to watch... Well, except the gore that inevitably happens but you still cannot tear your eyes from it. Sparring and dancing are merged into one. Words cannot do the filming justice, you just have to experience it."
Into the Badlands,Underrated martial arts series!,"Into the Badlands is a very underrated show that didn't get the recognition it deserved. It's an action packed thriller that keeps you entertained throughout the entire series and one of the better martial arts series I've ever seen! The fight scenes are the biggest highlight of the show though, the choreography is just beautiful."
Into the Badlands,"Best Kung Fu on TV, ever.","If you loved Bruce Lee, the old TV series Kung Fu, The Matrix, Kill Bill, Road Warrior, The Raid: Redemption and untold others I'm probably forgetting, then you'll love the genre mashup that is ""Into the Badlands."" I thought the ads were boring and redundant during episodes of The Walking Dead, but after seeing the first two episodes, it's pure, epic TV. Oh, and best of all, given the times, they banned guns in this futuristic post-apocalyptic society so everybody is highly trained with knives and swords. Yeah, the story is a bit vague and simple, but with with an Asian in the lead role, cinema-level fight scenes, what's not to love?"
Into the Badlands,Highly enjoable show !,"If you are here for the action, you are at the right place ! Just don't judge it by writing and acting. They did that very bad. The main story is decent. With tons of plot holes. It's predictable af but trust me, the directors are going to show you some good scenes. The whole world is just amazing ! They've build up some great sets, and then you can see them destroy it. The character development is ok, I guess. But the acting is just on high level horrible. Just like my grammar ! There is this character M.K who is just the worst thing in the show. Bad character and really bad acting from the actor. Same goes to Tilda. These two characters and actors are just terrible. You can see Daniel Wu who don't really know how to express a feeling ( mostly anger ) , but the guy has an awesome character. Sunny is such a badass ! Big exception are Marton, Nick Frost, Babou and Lorraine Toussaint. Maybe with some good writing ( story, diallogues and character development ) and some better castings, this show would've been perfect. And btw, the intro and the theme song are awesome ! My boy Mike Shinoda made the theme song. He did a really good job. Directing - 9/10 Set/Picture - 10/10 Costumography - 10/10 Music - 8/10 Acting - 4/10 Writing - 5/10 Casting - 4/10"
Into the Badlands,So Great!,"Absolutely amazing! I am just blown away by the storyline, the fighting, the beauty, the colors, and the creativity.

I saw one reviewer wrote about it being too unbelievable and that the actors look too perfect. I don't think that person quite understands the whole concept. The series is supposed to be like that. The colors are supposed to be incongruous to the depravity of the time and supposed to dazzle the eye.

I think the acting is great! I think that some of the actors, like the Barron and his son, are supposed to be over the top just like the colors are. I thoroughly enjoyed the premier episode and in fact, watched it a second time. I am mesmerized by it all.

Update after watching season 1: My affinity for the show only grew. I felt connected with the characters and naturally am concerned about their futures. As the season went on the stories of the ""villians"" were more flushed out which gave some insight into their reasonings and made them more relatable.

I am looking forward for season 2."
Into the Badlands,Watching the same dude die every episode 10 times,"I like the idea, don't overthink the fact that there are no firearms left for some reason. But the acting is horrible and over the top, I found myself just scrolling towards the fight scenes and skipping the bad story.

Also it's like you see the same actor die 1000 times, so many people die in this show that you start to reconize them. Like: ""Hey that dude died last episode also, and now he's dead again!""

If you want a show just to kill some lockdown time it's nice, but don't expect too much of it.

8 out of 10 is way too high."
Into the Badlands,The next cult series.....?,"You know the moment you start watching that some series are going to attract something of a cult following. My suspicion is, Into the Badlands, is one such series.

Into the Badlands takes already interesting elements from 19th century Southern USA, cyberpunk, Gung (Kung) Fu and Samurai/Western action series, mystical and medieval epics and drops the whole fruit salad of seemingly incompatible concepts, into the creative blender.

The resulting series is an elaborate and flamboyant cocktail, that works in spite of itself. The primary reason it works, is all these cultural icons are familiar. The futuristic setting is something of an anachronism, reminiscent of any 19th century Southern plantation. Lurid splendor and vice, gained from the oppressive toil of poppy field workers called cogs(cogs in a wheel), who are little better than slaves.

Sitting alongside this, is a little Mad Max-ian magic in terms of machines and vehicles that populate this world. Technology, resurrected from a whispered past that has seemingly been and gone but is not entirely forgotten.

That familiarity contrasts another, the transplanted martial arts arena, reminiscent of classic films like Enter the Dragon, mixed with a dash of Gladiator, a little mysticism and any medieval epic you care to name.

The result is a highly imaginative, visually luxurious, mesmerizing watch, thats instantly engaging and very enjoyable. Provided, that is, you don't over think things and accept this creative work for what it is. I have been addicted from episode one and plan to keep watching. Eight out of ten from me."
Into the Badlands,So where do you set the bar? What do you expect?,"Whether or not this is your cup of tea depends on your expectations.

If you are a Mad Max junkie, you are going to be in heaven.

If you like Kung Fu and WuShu then you are going to have to patiently sit through some so-so melodrama to get to the fight scenes. Which are pretty good. (Don't laugh -- an entire generation did this with Carradine's KUNG FU in the 70s)

If you like BOTH a solid story AND martial arts (like Forbidden Kingdom, for example, one of the best films of that genre) you may be disappointed.

If you remember the superb work that Gough and Milar did with Smallville (the first few seasons were polished gems, arguably the best work ever done with the DC franchise) you will be very very very disappointed.

So, bottom line, you get from the party what you bring to the party."
Into the Badlands,No effort in the last episode of season 2,Comentario no disponible
Into the Badlands,Best show I've seen,"I love this show. Don't see why they have to stop at Season 3 and keep the audience in suspense. It has a combination of martial arts, love and journey for peace together all for the one cause for peace. I would encourage more promotion and continuation of more seasons. I give it a ten star all the way around."
Into the Badlands,"Lots of Action, Great Story Line, Great Characters!","I rarely watch shows like this, but from the first episode I was hooked! I just watched the season finale and already can't wait for the next season. AMC would be crazy not to renew this show, it has GREAT potential! This was an excellent substitute for The Walking Dead. I have to say Into the Badlands is tied with TWD as my favorite!

I love all of the characters including the bad guys! Sunny steals the show as a lethal killer with a heart of gold. Quite often you can't make up your mind whether you like Quinn or hate him and the same goes for the Baroness, one minute she is a witch, the next you can't help but sympathize with her. Veil, MK, Jade, and all the rest do a great job in their parts. Overall a really well written show.

AMC PLEASE DO NOT CANCEL THIS SHOW!! We want more!!!"
Into the Badlands,The best new show on TV?,"In this current climate of book and comic book adaptations, we're getting used to seeing well-loved characters and stories being brought to life (with admittedly varying results) on the big and small screens. While this is all fine and good, it's a little sad to think that there's been very little in the way of completely original movies or TV shows in recent times.

Thankfully, shows like 'Enter the Badlands' come along every now and then to remind us that there are still some wildly creative and ambitious folks out there in the industry that are intent on unleashing their creations on an unsuspecting public. And it would appear that 'Enter the Badlands' came completely out of the blue as, despite being on many geek TV/comic/gaming forums and groups, I'd not heard a single thing about the show until one of my colleagues at work started raving about it and how amazing it was.

After watching the opening scene on the first episode, I had to pick up my jaw from the floor. Not only was this one of the prettiest, most visually arresting shows I'd ever seen, it was clearly going to be incredibly entertaining. It opens, you see, with one of the finest fight scenes I've ever seen on a TV show - if you think along the lines of the sublime sword-based fight scenes in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', that should give you some idea of what the opening brawl of 'Enter the Badlands' is like, but with some eye- watering, bone-crunching and bloody slaughtering of bad guys added into the mix.

But this show isn't all about the fighting. Well, OK, it is really but thankfully it's backed up with an intriguing plot and some excellent acting performances. It's difficult to wade into the story without giving too much away, but the show appears to be set in a post-apocalyptic world (I think?) and in an indeterminate part of the world that is ruled over by five 'barons' who are in a power struggle over the regional resources. That's about all I want to give away in terms of plot!

I've only watched the first three episodes so far, but I'm absolutely convinced that this is definitely one of the best new TV shows I've seen since... Well, Marvel's Daredevil, to be honest! But at least that in itself should speak volumes about the quality of this show.

I can't wait to see more!!"
Into the Badlands,"good entertainment, too many flaws","If you are a teenager who only cares about action, or if you are too bored that you wana be entertained with something, this is your series. But, if you have been watching many series, probably you´ll notice that this series is far from a great one. It has too many flaws in its storyline and action scenes. It almost seems like that its crew are writing each episode´s story, one night before filming it!"
Into the Badlands,Unique and excellent!,"All I can say is WOW! This show might not be for everyone - it has some of the best martial arts fighting scenes I've seen and it is really violent. In a way, the show resembles a sort of Game of Thrones / Vikings hybrid - but totally different! The acting is just spot on and the story is very intriguing. I cannot wait to see more! I've only watched 3 episodes and I really wish I could binge watch the rest. The 1st season only has 6 episodes which is a major bummer. The trailer for this show doesn't do it justice. The pace of the show is perfect and I never felt the need to skip scenes, which I often do with long, drawn out shows.

I don't write reviews very often, but this show deserved one!"
Into the Badlands,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" meets ""Mad Max""... Brilliant!","Great show, One of my favorites.

Into the Badlands is a Science Fiction adventure. Like ""Crouching Tiger,"" it has strong Martial art elements that makes this a unique television show. The combat special effects are fantastic; I have never seen combat effects quite this good on television before. Badllands also has dystopian SciFi elements reminiscent of Mad Max, making this a show that has strong appeal to both SciFi and action fans alike.

Emily Beecham as ""The Widow"" and Daniel Wu as ""Sonny"" are larger than life.

If you like SciFi, Far-East Mystery, and Action, this show is for you."

Into the Badlands,"Had to dump it, getting ridiculous","Dialogue was just getting too lame. Loved the first couple seasons but it has gone right down the crapper this season. Widow ALMOST made me hang on, her and her daughter are the only interesting characters anymore imo. Sunny and the rest are just unbearable to watch anymore."
Into the Badlands,Great show!!!,"This is a fantastic new series, and definitely binge-worthy!! Love the low-tech aspects-old weapons, swords, etc. Keep it coming! The detail on the costuming is amazing. Loved the leatherwork. The only thing missing is mail - that would work great with the period pieces and the swordplay. I found the characters to be well developed and relatable, with a good blend of traits that you both love and hate in each character. Keeps you wondering who's going to turn out to be good guys and bad guys. Great element to the plot! The location scenes were beautiful and appropriate, loved the mansions that looked like old Southern plantation settings. It worked great with Quinn's poppy plantation. It was refreshing to see the polyamorous aspects of the story, with Quinn's partners learning to deal with each other. Sad to see there was only one more episode this season. Hope it continues for another season (or twenty)!"
Into the Badlands,Bring it back!!!,Need more of Badlands AND more shows like it! Utter brilliance start to finish. Warrior is similar...Netflix...pay attention!!

Sugar Rush,Realistic British teen drama,"I am a big fan of the series, despite its having a few minor faults. It varies quite a lot from the book, more so as the series progress. I find Sugar particularly to be a very believable character, and it is good to see a real, uncensored teenage character being shown on terrestrial television. She drinks, smokes, takes drugs, is foul-mouthed, promiscuous and completely non-PC, and in my opinion is a much more realistic representation of a teenager than is usually seen, particularly in these teen drama type shows. Kim too is a believable character, and I think many teenage girls could identify with what she goes through. However, I do think that the writers could have perhaps focused a bit more on her struggle to identify her sexuality - she goes from an innocent, virginal type character to a wild, sex-crazed lesbian with hardly any time to stop and ponder her sexual preferences. I find it hard to believe that any teenager could be so quick to identify as gay without the slightest bit of confusion or worry. Also, she never officially comes out to her parents, and we just assume that after Series 1 ends that they, ahem, 'figure it out'. I think they could have done much better to have shown a realistic parent-teenager 'coming out' conversation, as this would be something a lot of viewers could relate to. In Series 1 Sugar Rush gets a little more far-fetched, and Saint is a bit of a two-dimensional character, but it's still a brilliant show, and I can't wait for Series 3! (supposedly coming to Channel 4 in around March 2007, or so I've heard)"

Sugar Rush,"An underrated, punk rock dramody","My god this series was ahead of its time... it has that skins/shameless kind of allure two it and sugar is the perfect object of interest with her effy stonem persona, a true British icon. Kim is a complex protagonist who is extremely difficult to get behind however, I think she embodies the angst and untamed frustration of many queer teens. Even though I didn't want to to relate to her I ultimately did. Together the two girls are a match made in hell.. the perfect gruesome twosome to carry such a fiesty/unrelenting show. The family are brilliantly performed and balance them well. Cancelling this was a big mistake by channel 4 and a definite indication of the times. I don't blame the lead actresses for condemning the decision so hard. A true tragedy."
Sugar Rush,Incredibly powerful stuff.,"'Sugar Rush' is unlike anything I've ever seen on TV before. On the surface it's a teen drama but it's really incredibly adult, hence its late-night slot on Channel 4. Some bits are most definitely not suitable for children, although it's more what's said than what's shown, and there is a lot of clever innuendo which completely passed me by on the first viewing. It doesn't tiptoe around anything; Kim is in love with Sugar and it's cute, but she's also 'sexually obsessed' with her and the programme makes no secret of the fact that she'd love to get into her best friend's pants.

It sounds like a recipe for every man's lesbian fantasies and from the first couple of episodes it might look like that's how it's going to turn out, but this programme had me totally hooked by the 3rd or 4th instalment and once it passed the half way point, I would probably have done a serious injury to anyone who'd made me miss an episode. I was in floods of tears more than once, which wasn't something I'd expected from the quirky comedy-drama I'd seen advertised. Kim is such a compelling character, and I just wanted to reach out and give her a hug every time she got screwed over yet again. The sub-plot of her parents' marriage falling apart was probably what hit me the hardest, with Richard Lumsden giving an incredible, heart-breaking performance as Nathan the well-meaning house-husband. The whole thing was so well written that just a few words uttered by one of the characters could mean so much, and stir up unbelievable amounts of emotion in me. There's also a slightly surreal style to the way the whole series is shot, which makes it all that little bit more compelling. However, the music contributed a lot to the brilliance of the TV programme for me, which meant I wasn't too happy to find it had almost all been changed on the DVD for 'contractual reasons'.

Olivia Hallinan is a fantastic actress who is definitely going places. What makes her so brilliant and sets her apart from other young actresses is her ability to downplay the role and keep Kim introverted, saying so much with her face and her eyes while keeping her lines almost deadpan at times, so that when she does bring out the emotion in her voice you can really feel it pouring out of her. For me, Lenora Crichlow was the perfect counterpart to this, making me hate Sugar most of the time yet still letting me understand Kim's infatuation with her.

This programme is utterly compelling and while I would give anything for another series, part of me hopes there isn't one, because it was so beautifully crafted that it would be a shame to see it fall apart with any more added to it."
Sugar Rush,EXCELLENT! finally a true portrayal of English teens.,"this series is amazing!! It is truly one of the best shows i have ever seen. the characters are relateable and funny. sugar and Kim are both beautiful and not stereo typed at all. They both convey emotions realistically and are extremely talented in there own way. the shows main brilliance is the fact that is deals with English teen culture in a true(slightly OTT but it is television)way, as a teenager i found most of the story lines very realteable and saw many of the characters in my friends. The only episode i found unrealistic was the last episode... but it is also oddly my favourite. Although it is over the top is develops the characters and Lenora Crichlow is amazing as sugar in that episode. shocking, different, emotional, realistic, relateable, strong, sexual. all words i would use to describe sugar rush one of my favourite shows on T.V."
Sugar Rush,Teenage virgin lesbian who is in love with her best friend.,"I thought this drama was excellent. It covered a subject that had been skirted around previously and drew in a vary of audiences. The way there are numerous plot lines taking place really keeps the program exciting and makes you eager for the next installment a week later. I was hooked on it and thought both actresses played an extremely convincing role. A teenage virgin lesbian who is in love with her best friend is a simple, yet effective plot line which is open to all possibilities and twists. All the characters binded together to make this successful drama and kept audiences in awe. Was sad to see it has ended, hopefully there will be further dramas similar to this one that can keep audiences intrigued and curious."
Sugar Rush,Love the Rush,"I have to say, I've become addicted to Sugar Rush. It makes up for all those years I spent as a teenager where there was not a hint of lesbionic viewing was in site. Young lesbians of today should be pleased to have such a show. It's entertaining, funny and regularly shocking. Kim's life is messed up but you don't realize to what extent until she narrates it at the start of the next episode. Still, in Season 2 she's starts to pull it together when she meets Saint. At least she has the love sorted. Her family, are another matter. and of course there's the CC. Wicked! You find yourself wanting to be there or anywhere like it. Careful people, this one's addictive!"
Sugar Rush,I think it was great!,"I love the series of sugar rush because I an relate to it so much, And I really feel as though I am feeling the the same feelings that Kim is, I have been there...But its aways nice to look back. I think that the series was good which is why now i have ordered the book off amazon, I am on my second chapter in it but the girls names seems to be saint and not sugar, The series I loved it though so i am not going to knock the book just yet because I am only 1 chapter into it! I wish there was more programmes like this, most of the time i find myself watching sugar rush over and over again, I hope there is a second series I cant wait, and the first series was well worth the money i paid for the DVD!"
Sugar Rush,Worth a try,"Garish, often frustratingly hammy, but well acted and very watchable. I can forgive a lot from writing that cares about its characters, which this evidently does - a show that has heart."
Sugar Rush,song lists,OK i Loooovvveee Sugar rush and have recently bought the book and series one and town on DVD!!! I had been watching the series on TV for a while and was quite shocked when the book was completely different to the series main similarity was the names!!!! but still i enjoyed it!! The performances but all r outstanding and have made me cry and laugh and relate the show works on so many levels for son many people!!! Only thing is that the songs on the DVD r not the ones on the TV so i was wondering if anyone would send me a full list of songs from TV for series one and two and a full song list of songs from DVD series one and two i would be forever grateful!!! my email address is jennabrown6@yahoo.co.uk or even if u could send me a site to go to that would give me that information!!! any help would be grateful!! Thanx xxxx
Sugar Rush,Amazing show!,"The has to be one of the best TV shows I have seen with a lesbian main character. Nothing in the US comes close to comparing with this show. It is not about her coming out, it is about her relationships and odd family dynamic. I loved this show from go till the very end of season 2. I am sad that there are not shows as amazing as this one on in the US. I am blow away by the candor and honesty of the show. Can't wait to see season three and recommend the show to anyone and everyone. Sarah-Jane Potts is to die for in season 2, Sugar is the epitome of a love hate relationship, and Kim is stunning as the lead in the show. Even Kim's parents and brother are extremely enjoyable. Make sure you check this show out.

This show deserves 10 stars hands down."
Sugar Rush,"Decent coming of age story, with a killer soundtrack.","It was back when LGBTQ whatever series, didn't have to be antagonistic to appeal to « most ». There were no preachiness or hidden agendas, because it was a show that never shied away from its true intentions, and ended up exactly where it intended to. Season one had the perfect balance of after school special and wacky storylines. But season two didn't, and I started to lose interest near the end of the series. British series have this way of entertaining you with relatable characters and situations. Sugar Rush had a great premise. Who never went through this? Wether you identify with Kim or Sugar, you can watch the series and recall your own secret crush, or the person you suspected had one for you. Apart from the show straying from its promising premise, another thing I didn't like about season 2, was how the Sugar character becomes too larger than life, and her over the top adventures and unrealistic storylines, made her storylines less believable. As colorful as Kim's family was (to say the least) her own were more grounded in reality and day to day events. It's a bold series, and is far more appealing and relevant than all of today's woke nonsense, so it is worth checking (online mostly)."
Sugar Rush,I think it deals with the issues well while also producing laugh out loud comedy,"I think it deals with the issues very well, and it does it in a comedic way without causing offence. i definitely recommend it even if u are not going through what Kim is. I definitely can relate to Kim in some of the issues and it has made me see the funny side of it. I think the actors who play Kim and Sugar are very talented. I hope it will be released on DVD as i think it is well worth getting it. The music used in the series is also very good. I give this programme 10/10 and highly recommend it to any teenager dealing with the issues or not. I also think the brother from another planet is very well used as most people with brothers feel they come from another planet but the brothers don't if you get me."

Sugar Rush,A British Lesbian My So-Called Life,"Not many Americans have seen this show (and with only twenty episodes, that's not likely to change) so I thought I throw a word in. I bought the first season because I buy lots of DVDs in PAL format since they have higher resolution and cost just a few dollars more to ship overseas. I stumbled upon this show which sounded like a lesbian My So-Called Life, one of the most celebrated shows about teenage life that barely survived one season on ABC.

The first few episodes are not all that good. Kim is manipulative and kind of despicable but at least is honest to herself about it (thanks to the voice overs, another thing that made My So-Called Life wonderful). It's easy to root for her because she's pretty and surrounded by awful people. Sugar and her mom are sluts, her father is clueless and spineless, and her younger brother is suffering from mental problems so severe I can't believe I'm supposed to laugh at them. Kim apparently had a lot of friends recently (look at the numbers on her cell phone) but dropped them once Sugar arrived and getting her seems to be the only focus of her life. She has no interest in checking out the gay clubs in Brighton where even a closeted minor can socialize and find friends.

There are some good attempts at light humor as Kim manipulates her mom and Sugar or have events unexpectedly go her way (in the clever ""crabs"" episode for example) but a lot of jokes go flat (like the ""date rape"" episode). At that point it's not much more than a funny soap opera and I'm wondering if this show is ever going to take itself seriously. If the DVD set hadn't traveled thousands of miles to me, I probably would have lost interest in it.

Then, in a swirling scene, one of Kim's clever tricks pays off big time! The light humorous tone disappears and the show suddenly and completely comes alive. Finally, the drama I've been waiting for arrives and it's intense and believable. Kim's relationship with Sugar becomes dramatically real and we see just how much she's put her heart on the line for her. The motivations behind her mother's cheating come out and a real mother-daughter relationship develops. Her father becomes a stronger, more sympathetic character and less of a running joke. Even the humor improves. I've never seen a show take off like this.

Also, I'm glad to see a series that shows that color EXISTS in Britain. We Americans see so many drab-looking British shows, we all think every day must be gray and cloudy there (well, every day I've been there was). Nearly every scene is full of blazingly saturated colors (much like our Veronica Mars) and the outdoor scenes on the Brighton Pier are wonderfully colorful and beautiful."
Sugar Rush,I've been there!,"I disagree with Simon. I assume he's a straight man that has no idea of what it's like growing up and realising your gay with no-one to turn to.

Admittedly the novel wasn't particularly easy to read but I think the television adaptation is excellent. The cast are all fantastic actors and I love the humour. As I've been through the whole 'unrequited love for a friend' experience myself I can fully identify with Kizza's emotions and I'm sure most people, whatever their sexual orientation can identify with the whole dating experience.

It's about time we had more programmes like this in the mainstream, then perhaps it would be easier for teenagers to come out, without facing the fear of ignorant backlash from uninformed heterosexuals."
Sugar Rush,"Awful stuff, really","A quick sum-up: This show has no depth and no subtlety. The editing and cinematography make you feel like you're watching MTV. It's a bit insulting to assume young adult viewers lack attention spans and need to be bombarded by fast cuts, loud music, over-the-top humour and non-realistic dialogue. Considering the premise for the show holds infinite potential, there is no excuse for doing such a lousy job!

To expand: Too many people defend this show simply for addressing the issue of a teenage girl's homosexual feelings, finally bringing such a ""taboo"" theme to mainstream TV. Well, that's hardly a feat when, as another reviewer posted, the show makes a mockery of sexuality. Okay, I'll give it 2 stars for not having a moralistic spin, but the way it portrays sexuality and just life itself, is hardly realistic or even intelligent (I mean, genres like satire or comedy can definitely be deep and captivating without being realistic, so long as they're intelligent!). This show treats the process of coming to terms with sexuality in such a facetious way - there is no development. I think it can be portrayed positively and yet with depth. I'm not saying that just because Kim is gay she has to agonise over it, or get depressed - it's great that she's embracing of it and just really, really wants to get laid. Great! You'd think the stage would be set for a witty, fun, no-frills drama. WRONG. Not even ""fun"" is handled well in this show - all the situations are so contrived, just aiming to ""shock"" viewers. Plus too much time is spent on Kim's parents and their sex life, which doesn't advance the storyline that people actually care about, so it's a bit WTF?! all around.

P.S.: And has nobody else actually noticed that Kim and Sugar have NO CHEMISTRY? It's hard to build a lesbian-themed show around two characters when their on screen interaction is so hollow and unconvincing. I won't blame the actresses, I'll blame the script and the show's creators."
Sugar Rush,An unexpected treat,"First thing's first. Perhaps at the grand ole' age of 21 I'm too old to have a valid opinion on teenage fiction but the book the TV show is based on is, as 15 year-olds round my way like to say, a pile of crud. The fact that Channel 4 even considered adapting such a waste of trees for prime-time TV amazes me. What amazes me even more, however, is what a great job they made of it throughout this 10-part series. Although the fast-paced narration and eye-assaulting camera-work give it a ""yoof drama"" feel that belies the 18-cert sex and swearing, the acting is of a consistently high standard (Olivia Hallinan could well be the next Charlotte Coleman) and the script pleasingly sharp. Some of the characters are impressively well-drawn. Go down to any shopping centre in the country on a Saturday afternoon and you'll find ten versions of the central character Sugar. Nathan the houseproud father and Dale the dim handyman are also convincing even though Stella and Matt are far-fetched. My only real gripe with the show is the characterisation of 15 year-old Kim. As someone whose life was made miserable by largely internalised sexuality issues a couple of years later than that, I felt that at times her wry, breezy narration of her adversity was not entirely realistic for somebody of that age (even someone of her supposed intelligence and maturity) in that big a situation. Then again, fiction is fiction and some of the lighter moments made me laugh out loud. I am very glad they released it on DVD, as it is something fit to be enjoyed again and again."
Sugar Rush,Confused,"The TV adaptation of Sugar Rush is at all nothing like the book. The characters are different, there are some missing, some added and the story lines hardly the same. However i find that its much more interesting than the book as some of the things are hardly realistic. I have mixed feelings about the adaptation, if i was Julie Burchill i would be extremely angry about the way the book has been handled. However the TV adaptation is much more appealing than the book. Sugar Rush really appeals to teenagers who can perhaps relate to Kim in dealing with the issues of being attracted to your best friend. Or any girl for that matter."
Sugar Rush,"girls in love, or girls in lust?","Hmm. I'm intrigued, blissfully happy, and yet undoubtedly worried about this programme. I'd love it if Kim and Sugar had an intimate moment, which started a journey of discovery; Sugar gets freaked, then confused, then realises she feels something for Kim too, and they build on these feelings (new to Sugar, old to Kim) cautiously and lovingly. I doubt this will happen. I think Sugar will 'try it out', and ultimately not care about Kim in that way, which will be devastating to Kim in the end.

Awesome soundtrack, awesome acting from Olivia and Lenora...but I think the outcome will bug me."
Sugar Rush,Not much from the first episode,"From not reading the book, I'm not too sure what I was going to make of the series. But the series seemed to jump too quickly into the story. Sugar is a quite annoying character, and I don't know if that is because of the character, or because Lenora Crichlow can't act. I think the only person that seems to save this series is Olivia Hallinan, because she's an excellent character.

A positive thing to say is that I can relate to Kim when it comes to the sexual feelings for girls, though I don't feel her desperation to have sex.

At the moment, the storyline doesn't seem much to me, which is why I plan on reading the book before next week. A good try, but let's hope it gets better."
Sugar Rush,Serves Birchill right for making such a fool of herself,"When there are so many scripts every year that don't get made and plenty of much better books that don't get televised, why was this chosen? Its rather depressing isn't it, especially when all Birchill was wanting to do was stir up Middle England. Excuse me, they don't care! The only programmes that really get people wound up (Men Only, Brimstone and Treacle, whatever) are good ones: that's why Mary Whitehouse used to attack The Sweeney and not The A Team. If its hollow it won't be taken seriously enough to bother moralists.

And isn't it nice to know that Birchill considers a teenage discovering she's bi-sexual makes ""a perverted little work""? This is the usual roller-coaster-directed Channel 4 insular media view of the world, a middle-class attempt to shock. Teenagers probably like to claim its accurate because that way it makes them seem hard."
Sugar Rush,A little saddening,"Am i the only bisexual/lesbian girl who feels completely let down by Sugar Rush? I think the whole series has been made into a lesbian love fest and is more about sex than it is about Kim coming to terms with her sexuality. It doesn't play much on how she actually copes with becoming a lesbian, she basically mocks it. I know from experience that it is extremely difficult knowing that you're something and having everyone else thinking you are someone different!I think the way it has been handled is completely immature. Especially when Kim's mum had an affair with the builder...I mean come on, do people honestly have mothers like that? I wish they'd have actually got some input from lesbian/bisexual girls. i now it was based on a novel but the way they portrayed the sexuality was like it was some sort of joke for people to laugh at."

Sailor Moon Crystal,Homage to the Original Work,"Adding this review to others, I've watched old and new many times. I feel people need to stop hating on this series. It takes a strong and dedicated person to make it through all the Sailor Moon series, and even then it's so drawn out that you lose sight of the plot.

Sailor Moon Crystal follows the original storyline and it is much more to the point. It even gave a new look to the anime by using the original art style. I put my kids in front of both and they're following Crystal's storyline better.

Don't get me wrong. I like the old one too. I was just sad to see people hate on this version. It's worth the watch."
Sailor Moon Crystal,A strong readaptation of the source material that gives a different experience than the 1992 adaptation while maintaining the core appeal.,"Usagi Tsukino is a 14 year old middle school student who despite self-describing as a ""crybaby"" and ""klutz"" is a loyal and goodhearted person with strong friendships. After saving a black cat with a moon symbol on her forehead named Luna, Luna eventually reveals she can talk and bestows Usagi with magical powers that give her the powers and appearance as superhero Sailor Moon, which she uses to fight against monsters that prey upon humans and their energy. Usagi is often assisted by the enigmatic Tuxedo Mask and eventually recruits other Sailor Guardians to fight against foes that are magical, extraterrestrial, or interdimensional in nature.

Running from 1992-1997, the Sailor Moon anime based on the manga of the same name by Naoko Takeuchi became a breakout hit in Japan vastly exceeding its intended 6 month run by 5 years and becoming a staple of the anime scene alongside other noted entries like Dragon Ball Z and Saint Seiya. As is the case with many adaptations of shonen or shojo manga, the anime was in production alongside the Sailor Moon manga and due to considerations of budget, episode orders, and etc. The '92 anime often deviated from the Manga to suit its needs. In 2012, Kodansha and Toei Animation announced a new adaptation of Sailor Moon was in production with an intended launch in 2013 to coincide with the 20th anniversary celebrations of the series (which was missed and ultimately released in 2014). The series was initially viewed with mixed reception with some criticizing the pacing and animation errors (which were corrected in later releases) in the first two arcs, Dark Kingdom and Black Moon, but the series did find more positive reception with the adaptation of the Death Busters arc in season 3. I don't think this is a case of Crystal vs. Sailor Moon '92 because they are both two very different shows that tell the same (to a point) stories but with different approaches to tone, character and story structure, so it's really not fair to either show to compare one against the other. With that said, if you did enjoy the '92 Sailor Moon anime then this captures the characters you love while giving you a different experience.

One of the biggest distinguishing characteristics of the original '92 series was in its dilemma/monster of the day approach to its episodes where the show was very much a comedy first and foremost with the comedic situations tying in with some sort of monster/antagonist that would drive Sailor Moon and the other guardians to fight against in their alter egos with the status quo re-established at the end of the episode so the formula could be repeated once again using a different dilemma/monster. In Sailor Moon Crystal, the series is much less formula based and directly adapts storylines from the manga so that the show comes off as more serialized with each episode flowing into the next one and building upon the previous one. While Sailor Moon '92 was and remains an enjoyable show, in the age of Netflix, Hulu, and etc. One can't ignore that the series doesn't exactly lend itself to binge watching with the metanarrative often taking multiple episodes before having any noticeable movement forward and there are numerous episodes you could hypothetically skip altogether and still understand what's going on at key points in the story. SMC feels like it's designed with that in mind as every episode of the show is important and you really can't skip any episodes and expect to get the full impact of the show. While this is allegedly tied to the presentation of the manga (that admittedly I've not read), this could be seen more as an admission of the tastes of modern day audiences who view these shows end to end as driven by a connecting plot thread.

The characters are all still mostly as you remember them from the original series, but there is a sense of more weight and gravity to the storytelling in SMC than in the '92 series. If the '92 series is primarily a comedy with some tokusatsu/sentai elements thrown in, then SMC is a Fantasy/Romance series with some comedy elements thrown in. While Usagi is still a good natured air head who's both exuberant and excitable, the series dials back these elements of her character still keeping them as integral parts of her personality but rarely incorporating the slapstick or artistic distortions that were present in the original series. The show also gives more weight to the initial meetings of the other Sailor Guardians with Ami established as being a quiet isolated introvert and Rei's spiritual powers making her a subject of suspicion and prejudice. While the characters are the same as they were in the '92 show, they are framed in a manner that goes for pathos rather than comedy in their interactions (though comedy does still come through, but naturally in their interactions).

The animation has been a sticking point for people on this show as well. While the animation does sometimes have some errors of unmoving lips of static figures moving in unnatural positions, the show is much more dynamic with its fight scenes with considerably more movement and posing than the '92 series thanks to streamlined animation processes and the budget being less spread out among 40-50 episodes as had been the case with the original. The fight scenes look really good with the Sailor Guardians exhibiting dodges and acrobatics that had previously been mostly absent from the series (per necessity of production) and their special attacks have more definition and freedom rather than relying primarily on animation recycling (though that is still utilized to an extent). Series purists have been critical of the CGI present in the first two seasons, particularly for the transformation sequences. As a fan of this series since the Dic Dub days in syndication, I honestly didn't mind them. While the Sailor Guardian models aren't perfect during the transformation sequences, they look fine all things considered and frankly I've seen worse. Though they do remove most of the CGI elements in the Death Busters arc.

Sailor Moon Crystal revisits the iconic series readapting from the manga and creating a more serialized viewing experience that emphasizes the fantasy/romance elements over the comedic elements from the earlier adaptation. While there's debate to be had on which version is the ""best"" version, I think there's room for both since their approaches to the material are so different the experience of watching the '92 anime is vastly different from watching SMC. I fell in love with the characters and world all over again thanks to Crystal and I teared up many times here, yes the '92 series had its tearjerker moments too, but their lingering impact didn't often carry past the episodes they happened (and no, this isn't a slight against the '92 series). SMC isn't a replacement for the original series, but more a compliment that takes the same material and looks at it from another angle and I encourage every series fan to watch it for themselves and make their own decision. For me, I loved it."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Keeps getting better and better,"I'm not gonna say it started as a big let down, because it wasn't at all. It was pretty good in many points: the soundtrack was ""decent"", the drawing trying to appeal to Naoko's originals were a nice update, also many background drawings were pretty nice. The hit also the right button by trying to keep make up sequences. The 2 things most of fans don't like and I kinda agree with them are: personalities (too weak, too little time on screen many of them) and 3D effects that didn't belong to the style. But they improved a lot going from 2nd arc (equivalent to SM R old series) to 3rd arc (INFINITY, SM S in the old series), then 3D was relegated to only exceptional cases, so make up sequences got really smooth, nice drawn, the look really really nice now, cannot complain. Sometimes the tone of the series gets dramatic, even EPIC, not gonna throw away any spoiler, but many but 2 or 3 moments surpassed old series level of execution, they passing, the personality threats, the time on screen got all better. So, to sum up I can say ARC 1 & 2 (SM SMR) were decent, while ARC3 ""INFINITY"" was AWESOME, better than the original in many points. Hope DREAMS gets even better."

Sailor Moon Crystal,It's like rediscovering anew something familiar,"I remember watching the original on CN's Toonami after school. Found this version on Netflix recently, and was a little confused if it was a sequel or some reboot, as it's been some 20+ years. The biggest let down I have of it so far, is it needs the original song. The characters appear much older than described too (not uncommon with anime's though). There are a lot of story problems, but that's not really the intent of the show though. It's meant to be fun and uplifting, especially for young girls.

After all the madness and politics of recent years, a cheesy nostalgic series is extremely welcoming. Usually, I'm not a fan of updating animation/film, but this one seems like it benefits from the newer technology. The heart and substance is still there. Got me binge watching anyways, and in a happy place. It's new, but feels like childhood."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Closer to manga!,"I prefer the strong and mature Usagi in Crystal like in manga than the annoying usagi in the series, also this series has better drawing, love it! Bring back Sailormoon in 2020 is really exciting!"
Sailor Moon Crystal,The guardians are back & better than ever (mostly),"I love crystal! A great fantasy story with some heart & excitement. By season 3 the show really found its way. I'll admit the animation isn't the best in the first season, but most tv shows have weak first seasons compared to the later, by season 3 the animation is gorgeous, the girls are powerful, strong & the story is very well told, although a bit rushed, a few more episodes per season to flush out the stories would have helped a lot. The writers really make an effort to stick to the original stories & not ""Americanize"" the more controversial story lines like the previous run, Neptune & Uranus are amazing together but needed a bit more infusion of personality. I was very happy to see the other guardians given a bit more personality & fantastic new powers. The guardians powers in season 3 are phenomenal & the animated scenes are the best ever shown, Jupiter Coconut Cyclone is probably the most bad ass power of all the inner guardians! I was also really glad to see (my personal favorite guardian) Venus given more of a leadership role in the group, her time as a guardian before any of the other girls shows through in her characters strength. However I absolutely hate how they waste her Rolling Heart Vibration power, it's only shown 1 time in the entire series & its wasted by being completely ineffective on the enemy, If a character gets a special 1 time new power shouldn't it do some damage?? I hope they continue with the next series because given how each season was better than the last the story of Pegasus & the dead moon circus has the potential to be something amazing, and as a child of the 90's who was robbed of the last season & all its transgendered superhero glory I'd really be excited to see that season redone. Definitely recommend watching, season 3 in particular."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Worth a watch still.,"I grew up watching the 90s sailor moon Japanese version with eng sub. Yes that series had alot of filler but it helped with character development of the side characters.

This new series has really nice graphics, the upgraded action scenes etc. The pacing is a bit too fast for me. Everything seemed so rushed. However the story is a tad bit better than the 90s since there no filler.... Another thing I feel it's missing is the in depth character development of EACH character. It doesn't have that 'umph' like the original. Nor does it have heart like the 90s one.

Personally I prefer the 90s anime better but crystal is still worth the watch."

Sailor Moon Crystal,a review made by a cringe 12 year old,I think this is a great remake of the original but In opinion its missing some important parts that were in the original but not in here. I love the music its amazing and in this series usagi isn't a crybaby that much lol. I love this new style and the transformations. If you don't want to watch like 400 Episodes of the original I would watch this even tho its missing some important parts its still a great option and it has 2 amazing movies.
Sailor Moon Crystal,Amateurish visuals,"I couldn't get over the low quality animation and incongruous styles. The quality is inconsistent; in some episodes/scenes the visuals look decent, in others it looks amateurish, like the characters were drawn in Microsoft paint or taken from a middle schooler's how-to-draw anime sketchbook. Sailor moon is frequently drawn off-model, with her nose and mouth practically between her eyes. The proportions of the character's faces and bodies are often wonky and inconsistent; hair too big/small, limbs too thin/long, facial features too large/crowded.

The blurred shading and water-color-like backgrounds don't match the hard lines of the foreground and characters. The terrible CG transformations don't match the conventional animation."

Sailor Moon Crystal,A much faster paced version of the classic sailor moon,"Retconned to have more in common with the manga, more stylized and more about the magic of the world building. Trimmed the fat with the antagonist of each storyline, the whole saga fits better together and the pacing is done well. What lacks with this new remake is dialogue and side stories. There is no sister like relationship between Rei and Usagi. They don't bicker or compete for Darien's attention. The inter relationships of the sailor scouts don't matter as much as progressing the plot. I must say, Chibi Usa is a lot more tolerable than in the American cartoon. I really enjoyed this version, the more faithful adaptation and I can't wait to see what they change in cosmos."

Sailor Moon Crystal,Not as good as 90s version,Comentario no disponible
Sailor Moon Crystal,Impossible to follow the storyline,"Having read the manga the story makes no sense, the scenes jump from one to the next with no clear connection, the music is atrocious compared to Takanori Arisawa's masterpiece. In fact it's atrocious no matter how you look at it. Just because a show has ""modern animation"" and ""follows the manga"" does not mean it's good. Maybe the 90s had problems especially Mamoru's character but when it deviated from the manga it came up with something equally good, it had drama, emotion and excitement. The characters had real emotions. I am however happy they have decided to fix all the issues in the new films which I'm looking forward to. It's sad they couldn't do the same for the first three seasons."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Modern Anime Ruins what was once Great- Again,"This new ""Modern"" Sailor Moon rips off its ancestor, tears apart relationships and lacks emotion. The new Voice Actors are boring and not as Iconic as the olds one (Granted they do a Normal Job) The Animation is Lackluster and is quickly changed after complaints. Spoiler: It's still ugly.

The show doesn't explore relationships like its Ancestor such as Chibiusa and Pluto- The relationship here is bland and appears as if Chibiusa doesn't care for Pluto. This is not how their relationship is supposed to be depicted. The Introduction of our Sailor Scouts is boring and does not fully express there personality with accurate Portrayals such as the first one (This is something you learn in writing)- For Example Jupiter is met by blocking Usagi from Water when a car passes, in the old one Jupiter fights a bunch of Bullies and Saves Usagi from what could have been a bit of a mess. The Old one gives us a great introduction of what type of character she is- Someone who should be seen as strong, cool and level-headed, whereas this new one, does not do that at all- I learned nothing from this. As I said before characters and scenes Lack Emotion, the cinematography half the time fails the show to be make it Unique so it just ends up like any other Anime nowadays. The new Art Style also makes it feel this way. Just like any other Anime. Sure the new flashy effects when they transform and do magic is cool but it doesn't make up for everything they decided not to do in the new one...

In Conclusion: Boring+Common Art Style, Bad CGI, Boring Voice Acting, Bad Cinematography, Lack of Direction+Lack of Emotion, Lacks the Understanding on how to express Character Growth and Relationships

Just don't waste your time."
Sailor Moon Crystal,The fandom getting what they asked for...and complaining about it: Sailor Moon edition,"Meaning with that the fact that a portion of the fandom of this franchise has, due to completely nonsensical and ridicolous manga elitism, convinced themselves over the years that somehow the original manga designed and ""written"" (?) by mrs. Naoko Takeuchi is good in itself while the 90's animated serial (deservingly a masterpiece of animes and superheroics in general) is a reduction of said manga and not the monstruous improvement over the sucky paper material that factually is. The problem is, if you'd ever had the bad idea of reading said manga, what you will find is an infantile (we're talking about Golion King of Beasts level of infantilism) piece of atrociously written fanfiction with unlikeable and uninteresting mary sues and gary stues as main protagonists while all the rest (the enemies, the allies, the actions themselves, everything) serves as nothing more than background scenery to express the awesomeness of said protagonists, literally one of the worst comics if not the worst written comic I've ever read to this same day with a nice (but nothing more than nice) design on it. Guess what? This series tried to be 100% faithful to such material, a material good for the ideas it could give to somebody else more able in the writing and universe/superheroics management but not as something on its own. And what happened? The inevitable, with people complaining about bad writing due to the source manga and her main writer (and NOT on Toei meddling on anything, since already the Sailor V prequel manga was not exactly a masterpiece of good writing to begin with, it was a fun romp considering the context of a 14-years old girl tentatively writing her first output ever but nothing more than that), and nothing else. Thank the manga elitists and thank Naoko Takeuchi, who evidently, not happy enough with the unwatchable fiasco that was the Live-Action series from 2003 and the continous ocean of money she receives due to the merchandise empire she owns, believed said elitists and greenlighted this thing convinced that her manga was really well written and worthy of a more faithful rendition...which is totally, ABSOLUTELY not the case. If you are like me and care like gold and platinum about the Iconic with a capital I, believable, universally-appliable and more human than human themselves version of the characters you learn to love from the 90's series and its linked movies, avoid both the manga and this thing AT ALL COSTS."
Sailor Moon Crystal,A dark and depressing adaptation,Season 1 review This show has a lot of references to Winx club and it's kind of similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer however the the characters were changed to having martial arts scenes The manga was much closer to it although the guardians in the manga Killed the male counterparts the four heavenly kings but in the show they don't kill them the heavenly kings were actually called the Knights of Endymion however in the manga Queen beryl is stabbed by sailor Venus but she isn't stabbed in the show they changed it to sailor moon instead and the sword destroys emeralds And I'm very glad that they adapted the manga into the second anime.
Sailor Moon Crystal,Bad CGI and more childish artstyle (in my opinion),"I just watched the 90s version and it was by far the best version of the series.

The CGI from the newer series was just horrible that I just dropped halfway and the storyline just feels rushed.

It can be that I just need to get used to the artstyle but they made the characters worse.

In the 90s version you had more feeling to it, you really got sucked into the series and you couldn't wait to see an another episode.

But with the Crystal I don't have that, it looks also more childish than the original.

I recommend the manga or the 90s version of the series. The newer version does not look good in my opinion, maybe for the younger fans but I like the 90s old school version more. :)"
Sailor Moon Crystal,No Thanks,"First I want to be explict lear that I am not into oriental films and cartoon. U have heard of this ""Silver Sailor moon"" and i choose it because the name is familair but it doesn't matter because all I was looking for anything 'popular' from the Asian countries a.k.a. Oriental film.

What is it that our formally strong and proud men see in oriental films, so called art and yes in deed women? The boniness is for another day and another cup of coffee but anyone knows that these Japan/chine/viet women are not all that.

So conclusion from watching Silver Moon (by the way finding this online was not eaxctly easy so it's not that popular he he) is that it is for losers. It is for the blue and people who are inferiority complexed.

Bonus deduction: The subtitles.. yup men need a reorinetation to strong western womyn who are professional."
Sailor Moon Crystal,Inferior to the original in every way,"Everything that made the original anime work is gone from this half-baked adaptation. The bright color schemes, beautiful 2D backdrops, iconic music, and loveably funny characters have been replaced by CGI clones with some of the most hideous proportions I have ever seen in anime. The entire thing seems to be an exercise in saying, ""Look what we can make with CGI!"" and none of it looks good or interesting. The CGI models used in the transformation sequences are particularly noticeably ugly and unpolished, the effects look tacky, and everything just looks plain and forgettable like something greenlit by Netflix. The music has been replaced with generic anime remake music, complete with some boring opera wailing reminiscent of the Evangelion remakes. None of the characters have distinct personalities, and with how ugly their faces look, it's often hard to even tell them apart. Such a disappointing release that I wish I could wipe from my memory."
Raising Dion,,
The Magicians,Screw you SYFY,I can't believe they're cancelling this show right as I found it and binged it on Netflix. There will never be enough of Eliot and Margo. Somebody ovary up and pick this show up. Please.
The Magicians,Really picks up steam after season 1,"I am surprised by how much I enjoy this series. The wit and intelligence in the writing, the character development, the acting... all of it is terrific. Season 1 is so-so, and at the very end of that season it feels like the writers were told to kick it into high gear because the final episodes build story line after story line to set up the next seasons. In Season 3 there is an episode that is so heartfelt that I weeped both times I watched it and just thinking about the story that was told in that episode (episode 5!) gives me chills. I was very surprised to find this fun/witty show could evoke so much emotion out of me in one episode. That episode stayed with me for a few days after watching it, which to me that is my mark of brilliant storytelling - I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I'm hooked. If you watch and get bored in season 1, stick with it! You will be very glad you did."
The Magicians,Good show...who cares if it's like the books.,First off I'll say I haven't read the books which I think makes me more qualified to give an impartial review of the TV SHOW without all the BS references to how this wasn't like the book or that isn't like that book or whatever. This is a fun show. It has all the elements of fantasy and adventure that anyone who enjoys those types of shows will enjoy. The characters are (for the most part) well developed and the actors are doing a great job with the material. A very good entertaining watch for anyone who enjoys adventure themed shows/movies or magic.
The Magicians,Never before have I disliked all the characters and still liked something this much because..,"Constant surprises! This show is a fresh take on all the topics you could ever imagine being linked to the umbrella topic that is ""magic"".

Yes all the characters are annoyingly teen-like despite being in their 20's, with the usual designated roles; the nerd, the bitch, the shy girl etc.

Yet this show is so (!) inventive with how magic is portrayed. I feel like the writers are very much aware of how annoying the characters are (haven't read the books btw) and portrays them this way in order to create this very fast, quirky and weird plot. There's simply not enough time to dwell on the characters while at the same time having this crazy and quite complicated plot unfolding.

The characters in a way becomes secondary to the topics being discussed, the underlying topic being the role, function and meaningfulness/or not of magic.

(Edit: having re-watched the entire show and going on season 4 I have come to actually like the characters. They have grown more complex and I no longer find them shallow which is a big plus.)

It is very 'in your face' and informal, with a lot of swearing and sets/costumes that sometimes look like a high-school play setup.

This show has made me: scared: it has one of the most terrifying characters I have ever come across in a show; it has made me think (on the definition of magic, on the experience of time, of death, of evil..) ; and made me laugh: It has a lot of humor, not in a 'one joke after the other' kind of way, but in the absurdity and craziness that is the show.

There are some VERY dark themes being explored in it, but it manages to do so in a way that doesn't leave you feeling down after watching it. For me partly because I didn't care too much about the characters, but I did care a lot about the plot so I kept watching, and kept being amazed at the inventiveness and strangely light and playful way it is written and delivered.

Just watched the latest episode of season 3 and Im still loving it!"
The Magicians,NOOOOOO,I just finished season 5 and I'm so sad there is not another season or at least a spinoff. A new network like Netflix or Hulu or YouTube need to pick it up! I need more magician's to get through quarantine!
The Magicians,Excellent and nothing like the book,"I will just start by saying that this is nothing like the book (which I like) and it is done in an excellent way. They basically just took the names and two or three basic ideas, but that's it. Even the Main Character has a different background and skills.

The premise is that there is an unhappy boy who wants something and finds a magic school. Sounds a bit... used. But:

1) Magic is a tool that the show uses, not a goal in and of itself.

2) The show focuses on many characters instead of just one and it develops their personalities and interactions, independently from the Main Character.

3) The pacing is really good of the show. They cover surprising amounts of subjects in one episode - this is not a show where they will make you wait for the finale for something exciting.

4) What they do is dangerous and people get hurt. Also, magic takes a lot of effort - you don't just say a word and wave a wand.

5) They curse and do not get always get along, and they smoke, sure, but they don't make a big deal out of it. It's not a prude show, but it's not a Spartacus/GoT show (blood & tits) either.

6) The first season has 13 episodes and SyFy has already renewed it for another season. So you won't just start a show, just to see that they cancel it at the end of the first season.

I'd personally recommend it if you are into fantasy. It's not exceptional, but it is good and it got me hooked up and wondering what will happen next. This is why between the first and the third episode, the 18-34 audience has actually been growing."
The Magicians,"You've grown up with Harry Potter, now that you're an adult watch The Magicians","This is Harry Potter for adults. Yes, it's a genre that's been done. But it hasn't been done like this. I read the first book in the series and my dislike for the characters kept me from reading the rest of the series. The good news: the show characters are more likeable... but not entirely. The Magicians embraces cliches. It's very aware of what it is. Harry Potter, meets Narnia, meets The Hangover. Yes, F-bombs are dropped like popcorn. It's laugh out loud funny(seriously, the one liners will make you cry) with a fantastical plot that draws you in and keeps you hooked. Bonus if you're into mythology."
The Magicians,Does Julia ever finally sneeze?,"You can see from her often half lidded open mouth expression that she must need to sneeze very badly, I'm 10 episodes in and really rooting for her to do it soon."
The Magicians,It's getting better with time,"At the beginning of Season 1 everything in this show is really weird and artificial. The characters felt gimmicky and that got more pronounced when you'd realize they're suppose to be playing teenagers. The plot also feels rushed, you feel there is more content between the lines that you can't really read. Things get more interesting when the main antagonist shows up and from there things start to look a bit better. What really kept me with this show are the characters (despite the acting) because there are no good/bad guys. I mean, there are villans and heroes but even while they're doing good all the characters seem a bit bored, like they're doing it because they think it's proper, not because they feel it's right. In that way they seem more inline with modern culture that always wants excitement but can never get satisfaction out of anything. As this series is progressing through seasons it's getting better and better. The plots are craaaaazy, Alice in Wonderland level crazy, and characters keep growing with the story and changing which is surprising because I never would have guessed it from season 1. Highly recommend watching it if you like something different and out there

I've seen reviews online that rate this show badly solely because it's not Harry Potter. I am a fan of HP too but this is not that kind of magician story, so keep an open mind."
The Magicians,melo sci-fi,Comentario no disponible
The Magicians,Excellent series with a tenuous relationship to the books,"If you've read Lev Grossman's wonderful Magicians trilogy you may find watching this series rather disorienting. The characters are all there and quite recognizable, and it's still about magic students and mysterious otherworlds, but it often feels like the series' writers cut the books into pieces, stirred those pieces in a bowl, then pulled them out and stitched the pieces together in random order, making up new stuff to fill in gaps.

That's not bad, and the world they have created works quite well, but it increasingly diverges from the books' mythology. This approach means I often find the show full of weird left turns where it shows me something familiar and then wanders off somewhere else with it, but the show is very entertaining, and it's prickly characters (awkward guy geek, ridiculously hot, short-skirted girl geek, snarky macho guy, snarky gay guy, angsty magic reject) are, if not quite likable, still fairly relatable.

The first changes from the book were relatively small. We follow Julia's story throughout the series, whereas her later reappearance in the book represented a plot twist. And while the books' Quentin did not have a Harry Potter-ish Destiny - he was just a smart guy so desperate for grand adventure that he would pursue all sorts of crazy things - comments made by supporting characters suggest that in the series, Quentin is in some way inherently Important. I feel that's a bit too obvious - the lack of destiny was one of those nice contrasts with Harry Potter - but it's fine.

Some story elements in the series are from the books, but they can come from any book in any order and are often mixed with things that aren't from the books at all. But while I'm often discombobulated by these changes, I'm rarely displeased.

Addendum: Just saw the last episode, so came back to say that this series held up throughout. Sometimes overly confusing, but overall very solid with an excellent finale."
The Magicians,The magical element of this show is its biggest redeeming quality.,"Season One: 7/10

Themes: Drama, Fantasy, Relationships, Mystery, Destiny & Magic.

Top three characters: 1) William 'Penny' Adiyodi, 2) Margo Hanson and 3) Kady Orloff-Diaz."
The Magicians,Season 4,Comentario no disponible
The Magicians,I have read the book,"OK I must be the only person who has read the book! Now the book is a hard read. I felt you are NOT meant to like the main character Quentin. He is a very self absorbed introvert, who in the book just walks away from his friends and leaves everything behind for his pursuit of magic.

To me he is the awful modern version of Holden Caulfield.

So this is NO Harry Potter - do not even compare. The books characters are flawed but deliberately. I felt the author wanted you not to like them.

I am not going into any detail. But the Show has taken the premise of the characters and re-written the entire thing and made something more, from shallow characters. I am really enjoying it. Don't waste your time on the book - this is one where the show outshines the pages."
The Magicians,I'm confused why I like this series so much...,"It's so difficult to describe why you should watch this series. I tried to make a few friends watch it, but they stopped after the first episode. I get why. I remember thinking after the first two episodes that I was not sure if it was a bad rip off of Harry Potter or that all the absurdity was on purpose and actually a stroke of genius. After a few more episodes it turned out to be definitely the last one. This series is full of absurd but amazing storylines, characters with depth, and it can make you cry and laugh at the same time.

I finished all 5 seasons in 1 week and really have a weird feeling in my stomach that it is canceled/finished. The end was great, but I want more. The relations between the characters feel so real to me, with such realistic emotions and relationship problems. That is the best part of the show really. I love how they show depression, dealing with abuse and addiction, and how series deals with the sexual orientation of the characters. It's a bit ironic now talking about this myself, while I actually love how the writers and actors don't make it a big thing.

I think this series, and especially some episodes, will stay with me for a long time. I don't think I have watched a series before that had such an impact on me. Even after thinking about it a lot, I can't really tell why. Maybe it's the quarantine, who f*cking knows. I see the flaws of the series as well, but still, I gave it a 10."
The Magicians,Excellent show worth watching! It might not turn out to be how you expected it from the description though,"So to start off I will say to you this: This series is amazing.

I am a huge Harry Potter fan, or a fantasy fan in general, and so I was really excited to hear of a series in which adolescents discover having magical powers. I expected to see a kind of rip-off from Harry Potter, but not that I really cared much about that, because I am a fan of the genre in general.

But what the show actually was like, blew me away. You expect some cliché main characters with standard personalities, some basic struggling with magic, some discovering the magical world through little quests and so on. Although it may seem at first this show gives you this, and it maybe does at first, it actually gives you so much more.

It touches so many topics, that not even relate to magic at all. They just use the magic to bind the story together. It is actually an adult show (would not advise watching it with younger children), trying to bring to you a story of a group of misfits that happen to all have magical powers. But it could have been a series without the magic as well and still be good. It's actually a very intelligent show, making a lot of references to other works of fictions. Every time you think you know what will happen, they surprise you by adding a new element to the show.

I know many people call it an adult, dark and gritty Harry Potter adaptation, and I cannot say that they are wrong. It actually is just that. But they way the story weaves everything together. I don't know, I think it's just very refreshing to see that the writers didn't restrain themselves on using real world problems and implementing these into a show that's actually about magic (not reality). It doesn't feel in any way forced and the pace of the show is really good. I have been watching this series and never had one moment thinking that it was getting boring. There are a few episodes that I just think are magnificent, but up to you to decide which are, because that's pretty subjective.

I would not say this series is a perfect 10/10. But in its genre and just for being so creative and different it is really a must to see.

The special effects AND the acting are both incredible for a series this ""small"". To start up a show with a very small fan base, almost from scratch and ending up with a quality product like this, from episode 1 already, gives me the feeling that this show will bloom to get even more awesome than it is already. I think season 2 is even better than season 1, so if you are having your doubts after season 1, I think it's worth a try to keep on watching and see how you feel about the second season.

All I can say is that if you're a fan of the fantasy genre and you're not easily scared by the ugly side of the magic, this is has to be on your watch list. Just don't expect it so be a sort of comedy show of a group of magicians just wizarding through the world."
The Magicians,A Journey Into A Dark World of Excitement,"After two episodes, this new series by the Syfy Channel has already captured my interest and my imagination. ""The Magicians"" is a supernatural tale adapted from the books of Lev Grossman, which I have not read. It will inevitably be compared to the Harry Potter saga, but it operates on a different level.

When we are introduced to Harry Potter, he is a young child, full of hope and fascination. Hogwarts is a Disney-like playground, full of wonderment. The main character of ""The Magicians"" is Quentin Coldwater (Jason Ralph)--a college senior who suffers from a general malaise, as if he never feels comfortable in the world.

His path is set--the obligatory applications for ivy league schools, probably followed by an unfulfilling career in something uninspiring. But he is sidetracked (just as Harry literally was) by unknown forces, and finds himself sitting for an exam. The purpose of the exam is obscure, but Quentin (Q) feels an opportunity is at hand.

The show is about Q's introduction to magic. At the same time, the viewer learns that destructive forces are at play. From its beginning, ""The Magicians"" lets us know this is a dark and sinister story, full of foreboding and impending menace. It feels more like ""His Dark Materials"" than Harry Potter, and that is a good thing.

The story moves quickly. We are introduced to competing factions and a world of dreams that may be real. A villain--one of the creepiest ever created with special effects--makes an appearance and leaves his mark.

There is also humor, mostly via the whimsical nature of magic. It provides a welcome relief. Otherwise, the show would be nothing more than a battle among dark forces.

Early on, Q feels like an underdeveloped character--one with potential and plenty of room for blossoming. Into something special, we feel. Into a person who knows his place in the universe. But there is plenty of time for that. We want to enjoy the journey.

Update 3/1/16: A world of magic should be unbound by the rules and conventions of the natural world. And that is the world ""The Magicians"" has proved to be. The world of magic is revealed to be inventive and unpredictable. It is freewheeling, nearly anarchic, full of surprises and possibilities. I am upping my grade to ""9""."
The Magicians,"Great storyline, terrible characters","The Magicians has an interesting story that sucks you in, as well as plenty of magic shown which is what we're looking for when we watch a show about magic.

It's very obvious, however, the characters were written for teenagers to relate to... they are all melodramatic, emotional, sex-obsessed a**holes with limited vocabularies (mainly just cursing and calling each other p**** and b****). The characters are very immature and unlikeable.

If you can get past the teeny-bopper vibe the kids give off, the show does introduce some interesting scenarios albeit inconsistent at times.

I saw The Order pop up in my recommended too, haven't watched it yet but it could be the adult version to this."

The Magicians,The Magicians of our days,"Great cast. Interesting plot with some well-written twists. Even though I must admit dialogues and characters logic of the last seasons are a bit cringe. The only thing I really don't like about seasons 3 and 4 is that there is no darkness this show used to have. It should've had dark atmosphere like in the 1st season IMO, but then showrunner took different approach or/and followed the books to make it more mainstream. Nonetheless, it's still entertaining :)"

The Magicians,It was so promising but they messed it up,Comentario no disponible
The Magicians,Disappointing show with unlikeable characters,"After seeing the pilot I had high hopes for this new series. Troubled teenagers who don't fit into society are being told they're magicians. So basically it seemed like a grown up version of Harry Potter. (Though the last few books and movies were def no children's stories anymore)

But the problem are the characters. There is not one who is likable. Now you can argue that they're not supposed to be and that the writing is on purpose but in my opinion this is bad writing and stereotyped acting. None of which is really entertaining. The protagonists can be troubled and full of flaws but deep down we still have to root for them and believe me I really tried to like them, but it's just not possible. All of them are self-centered, spoiled, anti-social or just plain mean.

This is a big disappointment. I feel like this could have been a really good show, but it's just not working."
The Magicians,Much-welcomed Harry Potter upgrade :-),"Clever and innovative approach to a not-so-innovative premise of a hidden magical reality, parallel to the world we live in - told from the perspective of a graduating high school student, struggling to decide what to do with his life. The narrative is well set, placed in the modern world with (young) adult protagonists; which immediately gives it somehow more real-feel, and makes it more relatable and interesting. And the idea it proposes - that the cause behind being an awkward teenager with identity crisis is actually sensitivity to magic - is a brilliant touch, with timeless quality and something that should resonate well with the audience.

It's based on a book I haven't read - so I can't really tell you how much it's faithful to the original or not. However, the storytelling in this TV adaptation so far has no flaws, it's just perfect.

It's contemporary, it's realistic, it creates credible logic in its own universe, it's presented by quality actors and it builds gradually into what I would expect to become a much more interesting and powerful version of HP-fantasy.

And if you might think we don't need a modernized, 'American' version of Potter-world - well, I believe you're wrong. J.K. Rowling may have started it all, but now we want somebody to try and make it into something more. For me, Harry Potter was always just a cute story of an slightly-upgraded-but-still-out-of-date world of magic for children aged 4- 14.

And because I will at this point most likely have antagonized all hard core HP fans - I want you to know I have nothing against Harry Potter. I think it's crafted skilfully, it's cute and I like it quite a bit, but at the time it was made I've simply felt I was too old (24) to get fully immersed into that world. Well, THIS story makes me feel quite differently about it from the start. It sits quite well with my expectations and requirements.

I'll say this adventure has started down the right path. We can only hope it stays or better yet, evolves that way. Judging by what I've seen in the manner of directing it so far, my hopes are high. And I don't really care if it doesn't follow the original, I've given up on that a while ago, while following the series such as The Game of Thrones or The Walking Dead. All I care about now is quality storytelling and and quality delivery.

Whoever claims it's boring - either is not really a fantasy fan, or doesn't really understand how quality and convincing dramatic build- up works: you really DO need a proper character-build in order to achieve it. And if the pilot is not to do that, what is?

This has all been confirmed times and again, and just recently strong case has been made by the success and critical acclaim of series such as Breaking Bad and its spin-off, Better Call Saul. We all know Breaking Bad has reached its peak interest, wide critical acclaim and cult status with its audience - only in its last, 5th season. Talking about build- up...

And BB was never really about thrilling action - the external development of narrative only served the purpose of creating dramatic tension that led to the inner change and (morally downward) development of the character (ergo, breaking bad)... But that hasn't stopped it from being greatest show ever, au contraire. That being said, I found the first episode of Breaking Bad quite slow and boring - but by the end of it I was curious. After 2 or 3 episodes - I couldn't stop.

I felt a similar pull while watching the pilot of this show, and since I wasn't totally happy with the only review at the time and also believed it deserves better rating, I wanted to contribute a bit if I can.

Since I'm already comparing it, can this be AS great? Well, surely not.

Firstly, it's just too far away from day-to-day reality everyone's experiencing, to be AS relatable. You're immersed into a surreal world where rules and contents are made-up and you have no vote over that: you are merely an observer, who can only accept what happens and maybe, track how much it makes sense. You and your life experience is - for the most part - excluded. What's more important, you can't really expect such ingenious character development when issues and inner conflicts of the main character are nowhere near as deep and socially and existentially relevant to be able to engage you on such a fundamentally deep level.

However, we are all nowadays more and more inclined to explore the true potential of life, so the topic of magic is indeed asking for far more (quality) exploration of it in the modern TV and film medium, then it's being done at the moment. So, this show is doing it justice, at the least.

And finally, when I look at it again - the pace of this show is actually amazing. There are sudden twists in the plot that make it quite unpredictable, there's been already a powerful appearance of a villain who promises to be an imminent and overpowering threat to our unlikely hero; while interesting inversions of the common motives and good-vs-bad principles of fantasy worlds (such as walking/not walking the 'garden path') and introduction of spiritual 'cross-over' ideas (as 'not having any molecule of control over what happens') make it cast undoubtedly a new, fresh and exciting light to the genre...

I've had a lot of fun watching it and can't wait to see more! 25th of January just seems so far, far away...

And if you still don't like it, I can conclude only one thing - you probably have no 'magical aptitude' AT ALL :-)"

Ask the Storybots,Sing along .... and learn,"Just great.... fun, catchy songs and educational (and not just for the kids!)"
Ask the Storybots,Very educational & Great Graphics/Animations,"Quite suprised to see a high quality content for childrens. Very educational and too many catchy original yet child friendly songs. Great characters fit very well with the brightful tone and exciting instrumentals. Great animations/graphics, explosion of bright colours and compelling voice castings. Its hilarious, adventurous and a bit of scifi/fantasy. No specific plots, just educational stuff, touching one topic per episode. To be honest, the characters reminds me of a mobile game. Totally eye catching for childrens and babies, even pets. Very entertaining even for adults, high rewatch value. Highly recommended."
Ask the Storybots,Funny + Entertaining!!!,"I am 31 years old with an almost 3 year old (oct), and he's addicted. I put on Netflix, he sees and yells for storybots, then sits and stares until someone gets hurt, then he laughs (moms sense of humor, lol). He repeats back to me things he learned from the show. And the clincher- I, yes the 31 year old, LOVE this show! I actually learn things from time to time, and I think it has quite a few funny moments!!! My only thing is, I'm not a big fan of the big purple one-their voice, their attitude, just that character. Also, sometimes it's a little too silly. For instance, its teaching really cool stuff, but kind of adhering to a younger audience."
Ask the Storybots,Awesome kids show- Super Catchy songs,"I have a 2 yr old and 4 year old and we are all addicted to this show. The songs are super catchy and we are all memorizing information about the Solar System, dinosaurs, principles of flight, bones in your body.. the list is long! I am a private pilot and I was really impressed with the way they display the forces of flight. Technically correct and broken down for kids to understand it. I really like Judy Greer and Weird Al Yankovic. And the guest stars are really varied and fun- ""How Does Night Happen?"" with Jay Leno ""How Do Airplanes Fly?"" with Kevin Smith ""Why Do I Have To Brush My Teeth?"" with Whoopi Goldberg ""Why Is The Sky Blue?"" with Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci of Garfunkel and Oates ""Where Do French Fries Come From?"" with 'Weird Al' Yankovic ""Where Does Rain Come From?"" with Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell I really hope that Netflix keeps making this show."
Ask the Storybots,Great family show,"We just found this and the kids love it. I liked the guest appearances (kind of a nod to the parents watching, as the kids have no clue who any of the actors are), and it was interesting for me as well as educational for them. Oddly enough, three of the episodes were questions my incredibly inquisitive 7 year old had asked me within the last week or so - night, airplanes, and the sky being blue; this explained so much better than I did!

The song breaks are fun (Chicken Bop is a new household favorite, especially with the 5 year old!), the different animation styles and the mix of live-action and animation keep things interesting, the bonus fun facts throughout the episodes are great, and even the little filler bumps with Hub and Bub get laughs from the kids.

The way complex concepts are explained through exploration and investigation and then further reinforced with a song is fantastic. This is one show I definitely don't mind my kids watching because they learn so much while enjoying something that's still fun and silly (but not so horribly annoying that I can't stand being in the room with it). I hope they make more episodes!"
Ask the Storybots,4 yr old loves it and learns,Amazing show. Please make more. My son has watched all the seasons over and over again and learns so much. The music is super catchy and entertaining. Love its
Ask the Storybots,Laugh out loud learning for kids & adults,"This show is hilarious. When my son watches it, the whole family gathers to watch it with him... seriously! Everyone from our 3 year old to his grandparents love watching this show. The songs are well produced and catchy. The different styles of animation (including claymation, which I adore) are all very well done. As an author of non-fiction picture books, I'm super impressed with how the science is explained as well. It's clear, memorable, factual, and never talks down to the kids. It introduces new learning in a fun and approachable way. The guest stars are also a fun addition. Really, the whole show hits a home run. I only wish there were more episodes!"
Ask the Storybots,Story bots are the best,We love storybots here ! Even the grumpy nine year old loves it. Season two just came out and has already explained so many things they've asked and I didn't answer nearly as well as these little robots. I could never explain computers as well as Snoop Dogg lol
Ask the Storybots,Great children's show! Entertaining for the whole family!,We love this show in our house. It's funny and educational at the same time. I like fun celebrity guest stars. The songs are awesome as well. They get stuck in our heads all the time. Hoping they make more episodes soon. My son has already watched the first two seasons a countless number of times.
Ask the Storybots,We LOVE this show!!!,I really hope they keep making this show. My son & I love watching it. The guest appearances and songs are awesome. I've also learned a few things I didn't know.
Ask the Storybots,Storybots is Amazing,"I have a 4 year old daughter that can't get enough of this show, and we really hope they keep producing more episodes. I love the questions asked by the kids and how the Storybots go about solving their scientific inquiries. Heck, even I learned a thing or two when I watched the ""Why is the sky blue?"" episode. They don't make it cheesy or dumb it down. They break it down into parts that are easily understood by toddlers and have great humor that is safe for kids of that age, but still funny to adults. The songs are great for this age group and short for their attention spans. My daughter gets up and dances to a lot of them. Just an overall wonderful show!"
Ask the Storybots,THE BEST!!!,"Perfectly wonderful show that captures the imagination, attention, and cleverly wraps it all in brilliant educational material of complex subjects for younger minds to grasp and enjoy!!! I love this show!!!! My husband told me how much he and our 2 year old laughed and learned!! Now the rest of our family gets caught up in watching along with the elementary and high school kids. I haven't seen such good work in a long time! Bravo! Well done! (They also have a sound track for the excellent music they've done! Don't miss out on it!)"
Ask the Storybots,I really don't get the positive reviews,"I loved the premise of this show and happily turned it on for my two boys - aged 4. Firstly- the delivery is so frenetic it makes a high octane Hollywood action movie look slow. There is a 2 minute scene of a lion bouncing around on screen making a series of weird and desperate noises which is enough to give one epilepsy, and I'm still not sure what it's doing in an episode about volcanos.

Most of the characters don't talk- they yell, and most of the time they seem insanely stressed out and so overcaffeinated they exude it from their eyeballs.

Every movement is a jolt, every expression and emotion taken to its extreme. The questions posed and answers given are lost in a quagmire of inane chat. Perhaps the point of this is to prime our children for the Internet age, where they have to sift through endless clickbait and distractions to get information.

If you are appealing to children, who biologically have shorter attention spans, why make a show 25 mins long when you could answer any questions posed (wrapped in a fun storyline) in 10 mins?

Just- no!"
Ask the Storybots,Best EVER!,"This has got to be the most entertaining and intellectual thing I have ever put on for my kids. My wife and I sit there with them and learn too! It's fun, great songs and the topics are well laid out for anyone to understand! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
Ask the Storybots,Great show,"I learned a lot, its funny.everyone loves it ,it's not annoying.the characters are cute , it keeps kid's attention. There are celebrity guests !"
Ask the Storybots,A family favorite.,"We've been watching story bots with our 4 year old since he was 2. He still loves it two years later, and out of everything he watches, Storybots never gets old or boring. Ofr him or us Its a fantastic show with amazingly cool music and subjects for kids. Its intelligent but well pitched for toddlers. Very highly recommended. Lets hope they make more."
Ask the Storybots,Intelligent and So fun for kids and adults,"First, I'm pretty selective. I have no patience for stupid programming, especially stupid programming aimed at children.

Storybots is smart, funny and memorable. Weird Al does a bunch of the music, but their are several other contributing artists. They have celebrity guests, and Judy Greer is one of the main characters.

Their music sticks with you"
Ask the Storybots,So Good!,"I absolutely love watching this show with my son and my daughter. We love the music my mother even sings along. My son has learned so much and now refuses to watch peppa pig, trust me when I say put this on for your little ones. We know all the words by heart and can't wait for season 3!"
Ask the Storybots,One of the better kids cartoons.,This is so much better than 95% of the cartoons out there. It actually teaches the kids things and I think I learned a thing or 2 myself. The songs are catchy and fun. My kids love it.
Ask the Storybots,Intelligent & Hilarious,"With two young children, I watch a lot of kid shows- all of which are screened by me and my wife. Storybots is by far the best of them all. It's entertaining, intelligent, and funny for both kids and adults. I never have an issue when my kids are watching a marathon of Storybots because I know they will always learn something. They also have an amazing list of guest appearances- definitely a bonus. Highly, highly recommended."
Ask the Storybots,Fantastic!,"Great stories, lovely characters and educational topics all with catchy tunes. My autistic 5 year old is currently obsessed with them and I don't blame him! Each episode is just about the right length to keep a short attention span and they're genuinely interesting. My little boy has been able to learn all about the planets, shapes, colours and the human body - despite having real difficulty with classroom learning. I can't praise the Storybots highly enough.

Please make more episodes (and finish the collection of talking cuddly toys - we need Boop and Bing!).

Absolutely recommend giving them a watch - 100%"
Ask the Storybots,Nostalgia Feeling,This is very nostalgic I remember watching this in my wolf ranch school it was very entertaining!!! I will recommend every Generation Alpha kid to watch this because us Zoomers are Watching Some of The Good Stuff while y'all are watching your Stupid Cocomelon or YouTube kids I want every kid under 16 to watch because the Amazing Actors/ Rappers That are In This Masterpiece of a TV Show I Want This Show to not Stop because Parry Gripp is a Nostalgia YouTube Creator I want more of Him I need him to not quit and not stop because it makes me Happy that they Still Going! - That Young Movie Lover!!!

Ninjago,Actually impressed,"So far, we've been surprised by how well done this series is. Being a toy-selling series, we honestly were expecting the kind of shows we saw advertising toys when we were young: pointless, poorly written, and cheesy beyond belief. As adults, we actually ENJOY watching this series, and seeing what happens! Since it is geared to children (I would say about ages 8- 12), some of the plot ""twists"" are actually fairly obvious for an adult, but still interesting.

The ideas about devotion, loyalty, and accepting differences have also been really useful in our household, where we have been able to have effective discussions about autism, disability, and ability based on these characters and their adventures. We have also been able to discuss social interactions and ways to think about others in ways that can be hard to broach with this middle-elementary age: that people who seem to be friends may not be, that bullies have their own issues, and ideas of including others and finding your own talents when others don't include you. There are lots of other good, complex issues of relationships presented here, in terms this age group can grasp and see.

We actually find ourselves wishing there were MORE toys associated with this series, not less. And unfortunately, many of the figures are exclusively available through the larger, very expensive Lego sets (do keep in mind this series is intended to sell you toys!)"
Ninjago,More to it than a toy commercial.,"Almost all of the ""professional"" critics gave this an unfair score because they didn't see it as anything past a toy commercial. That is wrong, you must see it as a show, and nothing else, in order to rate it. And of course Lego's main reason of making the series is to promote the sets so that they can get attention. But if that was so (it is only a toy commercial), then why is there such attention to detail that one might argue that there is too much detail?

Ninjago's story starts out basic, but as the show progresses, the plot starts to get very interesting, just like any other show. It combines interesting topics with Japanese and Chinese culture, so it isn't the same thing you've seen a million times. Characters are different, with unique drives and personalities.

A strong point for Ninjago is it's graphics. If you can, watch it in HD, and the details I was talking about will keep someone who is uneasy staying (Especially the spirits season). The characters are not shiny, as is assumed since they are minifigures, rather certain parts of the suits worn are (armor, badges, gold and silver decorations). It is the best looking 3D show on Cartoon Network. Also, the show might be based on the Lego sets, but the show itself actually has no Lego to be seen besides the characters.

The show is suitable for anyone apparently 7 and older, but there is still some uneasy moments, death, and light blood as well as small to large scratches are visible on characters (but it's almost unnoticeable).

On the topic of toy commercials, yes there are certain sets that can be seen in the show, but not all of them. For example, the largest Lego set in the season 5 wave is a huge temple, yet it is not seen in the show at all.

All in all, Ninjago is a brilliant show that honestly deserves no less than a 7/10, as anything less is most likely someone who has harshly branded the show as a giant toy commercial that is only watchable by kids."
Ninjago,Yes...a LEGO show is actually great.,"Yes, I know. It's a LEGO show. About ninjas. It's a toy commercial. The storyline blatantly takes ideas from every story you've ever heard before. It's for kids, and though I'm a kid at heart, I'm not anywhere near Ninjago's target age range. And yet, Ninjago is one of my favorite TV shows. I first discovered it while babysitting a group of young children. But after a couple of episodes, the kids I was taking care of wanted to watch another show, and well...I wanted to watch more of Ninjago. After that, I was hooked. And not only me. I've introduced it to other friends and family members, from young kids to people in their twenties. And funny thing is...we've all enjoyed watching this show as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Because Ninjago, despite being so full of clichés and one giant LEGO commercial, is ridiculously fun.

This could have been, and should have been, a terrible show. But everyone involved in the show's production does such a fantastic job of turning Ninjago into something worthwhile, especially considering that they're making a show so that LEGO can sell toys. The animation is great. It look beautiful, and the world of Ninjago is vibrantly brought to life. It's colorful, and it only improves. The voice acting is also fantastic. A couple of the voice actors, (E.g. Vincent Tong and Kirby Morrow) I was already familiar with. But everyone in this series does a wonderful job creating memorable characters, and the voice actors contribute greatly to that. The best thing about them is that their performances never veer into 'shrill and annoying' territory. The actors do a wonderful job with what they are given. I assume that they don't record their lines together, but the chemistry between them feels so real, I could swear that they did. Skales, Pythor, Wu, Garmadon, Lloyd, Nya, Dareth...every voice is unique and enjoyable. The music in this series is AMAZING. It was one of the first aspects of this show that intrigued me. Mike Kramer and Jay Vincent have given Ninjago the care you would expect to find in a cinematic film score. Don't believe me? Go and look at Ninjago's Overture soundtrack. Or the Falcon Chase Theme. Or the theme for the Temple of Light. They're gorgeous pieces of music. The Fold also do a great job with the show's opening song, The Weekend Whip. These are all great elements, but The Hageman brothers are the anchor for this show. Somehow, they've managed to write a classic story, one we've seen hundreds of times before, and and still make it feel fresh and exciting. The characters they've created are great. The four ninja are different and each enjoyable. Our heroes are relatable, and flawed, but still admirable. Their friendship and camaraderie is genuine, and never feels forced. The character development each of them go through is impressive for a children's show. The humor in the show is usually great. I actually think that Ninjago is one of the most quotable shows I can think of, and some lines are just pure gold. The writers do a great job of winking to the audience at the right times. There are a couple references to pop culture, ala My Little Pony. Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Back to the Future, for example, are all alluded to in certain episodes. But the writers are very good at neither hitting us over the head with irony, or taking themselves too seriously. They know when to admit that the series is a bit of a joke, and when to treat their plot and characters with the respect they deserve. That's not an easy balance to attain, and I think the fact that they manage to pull it off...in a LEGO show no less, is a pleasant surprise.

All in all, Ninjago succeeds in being something that can appeal to both kids and adults. I can't think of anything more to say about it, really. The production quality is high, the show is great, and it teaches kids some lessons without pandering to the lowest age group. It's a very smart, entertaining, and always fun show that will make your inner child smile."
Ninjago,This show has depth,My kids started watching this and I found myself getting sucked in. The characters and plot have a depth to them that even an adult can enjoy. Great show!
Ninjago,Lovable characters and exciting plots,"I love the Ninjago series, because it has so many different factors that work in its favour: the characters are unique and relatable, the plots are exciting and engaging, the script can be funny at times, and the graphics are pretty good. My favourite thing about the series is how it immerses you in the world of Lego Ninjago, and you feel yourself drawn into it so that you want to watch more and see how it develops. I recommend it for kids and adults alike!"
Ninjago,This show is excellent!,"This is is truly amazing. The characters are great, the writing is great, the music is great. Everything about this show is awesome! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes Lego. The show is set in the fictional world of Ninjago, a place inspired by Chinese and Japanese myths and culture. It appears in the series as a large sprawling land most like the island chain of Japan, with different areas being home to various animals and plants, including Dragons and mystical snakes (like the Great Devourer). It has an underworld, where beings of evil like Lord Garmadon and the Skeleton Army dwell, together with sacred places where many things are hidden or forgotten (like the Serpentine tombs or the Golden Weapons). Similar to Lego's past product line Bionicle, the main characters are in tune with certain elemental properties (the elements in this case being Fire, Ice, Lightning and Earth.) Also, the world seems to have a more modern setting than previous 'Ninja' series, as shown by the appearance of large skyscraper cities, various vehicles, video games and exo-suits. Again I love this show and can't wait for the next season to premier in early 2014!"
Ninjago,THIS SHOW IS AMAZING!!!!!!,"This is one of my favourite TV shows. it is a great family friendly show for all ages. and don't believe the people who say it sucks, because it is amazing. so I give it a nine star rating because it is funny, action packed, full of adventure, and just because it is a great show. this is one of my favourite LEGO TV show/movie. but I'm just going to warn you, if you start watching this show, you might not be able to stop! so I would recommend watching it!"
Ninjago,Aged like fine wine,"As a kid, I used to watch this show a lot. I stopped after it was originally supposed to end but I gave it a second chance recently for nostalgia sake and rewatched the pilot and first 2 seasons. Everything after that was completely foreign to me. I thought the first few seasons were great, but the seasons after that were phenomenal. I originally thought that the show would lose its touch, but in my opinion the seasons got even more complex and entertaining. I really enjoyed how dark it got in the later seasons and how you could forget that it's a show about Lego people due to the amazing character development. Overall I love this show because of its humor (even though at times it could be better) and that it's self aware and doesn't always take itself too seriously. I would recommend that anyone, kids or adults give this show a chance! It's way better than it sounds!"
Ninjago,A toy Company made this?,Comentario no disponible
Ninjago,Great show! Do NOT listen to critics!,"This show is awesome! I know, people always say: ""but it's LEGO, it can't be good, it's just a big commercial"" well, let me tell you something, they're wrong! It is actually an amazing show! It also appeals to many teenagers and adults as well, not just little kids! Now lets get down to the review, acting first.

The voice acting in this show is VERY decent for a kids show. They get pretty good voice actors. (Vincent Tong, Kirby Morrow, Andrew Francis etc,) Some of the voice actors in this show are also from other very good shows, such as My Little Pony: Freindship Is Magic. I would rate the voice acting a 9/10.

Now we will be talking about story. The storyline for this show started off very simple, but then later grew bigger and more impressive. The shows original story was The First Spinjitzu Master created four golden weapons for the different elements: Fire, Lightning, Earth, and Ice. Then, the evil lord garmadon tried to take the golden weapons and the spinjitzu masters son, sensei Wu, had to gather four ninja to stop him. Sort of weak but later in the 4 & 5 seasons it some what expanded. I would rate the story a 6/10.

The music in this show is Excellent! It ranges from ancient sounding music to tech- sounding music. It has wonderful tunes with a lot of time and effort put into them. I would rate the music a 10/10.

Now it is time for the script. It has a very funny and cute script that makes me laugh, also has some heartfelt lines in there, maybe a few corny ones thrown in there. I would rate it a 8/10

I'm going to talk a little bit about the seasons, which includes some very personnel opinions, if you don't need to see it then skip ahead to the end.

My favourite season was the 5 one, ""Possesion"", it had a intriguing plot, awesome characters, and great humor, but I am also extremely fond of season 1 ""Rise of the Snakes"" because it is what got me into Ninjago, and season 4 ""Tournement of Elements"" because it just had a really ""Ninjago Feeling"" to it, and the characters and villains were amazing. The 2 & 3 seasons were good, but I think that they relied to much on action and cool vehicles, not as much humor, story, and character development. I'm giving it a 7/10 for the seasons and their layouts in general.

So that is my overall opinion on LEGO Ninjago! I think this show deserves a 9, especially compared to other new kids shows. Ninja-GO!"
Ninjago,It should've have gone on for so long,"LEGO Ninjago is a series that I grew up with. It was cheesy and had poor jokes, but I didn't care because I was a kid. Now I'm older, and I keep asking myself, ""Why are there ten seasons for such a simple yet entertaining show?"" So I rewatched some of the episodes and found that the series was much better when it stuck with its original story and only continued its story to tie up loose ends. My favorite season has got to be Season Two. My least favorite is Season Six. All in all, this is a classic show. Definitely recommend it for the kids. A fun show that will at least keep you entertained"
Ninjago,WATCH IT NOW!,"I remeber watching this when i was a kid and i started watching this again because i wanted nostalgia. Currently on season 1 btw. But i really recomend you to watch it. Yes, it's for kids but it's really well written compared to other kid movies/series. Season one is a bit boring but to understand everything you bred to watch it. So go and watch it!"
Ninjago,A good coming of age show,Comentario no disponible
Ninjago,Mediocre effort at best,"This show has moments of inspiration but it overall boils down to no more than that - a few good moments. For a show based off of Lego toys, it's quite an accomplishment. Though, among some of the better shows currently airing (Steven universe; adventure time) this show falls quite short of being good. It follows a very formulaic approach to its ""gifted child has to find his path"" story. The action scenes are well put together, the story occasionally intriguing despite sinking into cliché territory, and the animation is top notch. It's the poorly developed characters that sink this ship. They're all irredeemable, generic, standard issue vessels to fuel this canon. None of them show any of the complexity that you'd expect of them, and they don't leave you feeling like you need any more of it. A show with great potential that can't overcome the obstacles that it sets for itself."
Ninjago,Pretty Good,"I'm impressed, the only reason why it's at a 6.2 is because critics don't give trash about it being a kids show. It's LEGO for heavens sake. Kids around 5-10 play with LEGO. The show is MADE for kids for the most part. This shouldn't be criticized as ""Oh the story wasn't well made."" Even I agree with that, but it's a kids show. A lot of kids don't care about all these required (Good story, outline,plot, and reason etc.). they want an entertaining show to watch and laugh with. Most of these kids shows are action comedy, or princess love(for girls). Plus, reviewing this for a kids show is a 10/10 because it has a pretty well made plot."
Ninjago,This is my favorite show ever!!,"This show is the best! So far 10 seasons have been complete and season 11 is airing right now! Season 9 is my favorite so far, my favorite episode of the series is Season 10 Episode 3, ""The Fall"" Anyway be warned, this show will hook you and you may not be able to stop watching it!! Season 11 airs on cartoon network every Saturday and I'm excited for episode 3 and 4 on June 29!!"

Ninjago,Best show ever?,"**this review doesn't contain specific spoilers but it may contain some vague hints at plot points**

I know, you might think it's preposterous of me to consider a cartoon that promotes little boys' toys the best show ever. And that opinion is coming from someone who doesn't even care about Lego and dislikes the Lego Movie.

But Ninjago is a masterpiece. Is it full of clichés? Well with a villain called the 'Overlord', episode names like 'King of Shadows', and story aspects such as villainous brothers and missing parents, it certainly sounds like it's full of clichés and edge.

Here's the thing though. The characters are so realistic and easy to grow attached to. Every character has secrets in their past and challenges in their future. Watching the ninja team's chemistry evolve throughout the series is amazing. You grow to truly care about them.

And you grow to truly care about their adventures too. Rarely are plot twists predicted that easily, and the show always has surprises in store for you. Characters suffer in unexpected ways and go through tragic sacrifices that literally change them forever. Yet, despite going through riffs and difficulties, they are there to support one another with beautiful examples of teamwork and friendship.

Furthermore, the show is hilarious. It sure does a good job at making you want to curl up and cry but it is near impossible to go through an episode without cracking up. It can be amusing and downright silly at times, and combined with the powerful emotion and suspense, this makes it worth checking out no matter your age or gender.

So, I definitely recommend giving this show a try. It truly gets better and better as it goes on. Smoother animation, deeper character bonds, more menacing villains, and more spectacular settings. Following the lives of these Lego ninjas is a journey both inspirational and chortle-worthy.

Suitable for any age, and offering entertainment to many different types of people, I think this is generally the best show out there and it deserves a lot more recognition. It exceeds My Little Pony and perhaps even Steven Universe to me (and I like both those shows as well)."
Ninjago,The best,"It's simply a show that both girls and guys will remember all their lives and can connect deeply with it, I know it's childish and unrealistic when you watch it but that's how a kid thinks, I still like it and I'm a grown man... no I'm 17 but I will admit I love the show, my friends liked it to, I recommend your kids watch it! A great show that will keep them coming back"
Ninjago,Decent Cartoon,It is a imaginative cartoon. It is very visually appealing. It can get repetitive.
Ninjago,Great show!,I started wathing this show propably late 2012 in my late childhood so now I'm still bringing every season. It truly is a wonderful show no matter what age you are.
Ninjago,F you show runners,"A 6 for nostalgia of the first 4 seasons, but the rest of it sadly turns into a dumpster fire. Every bit of potential with a fun world like this is ruined and ripped to shreds."
Ninjago,My favorite animation series in my life,"When I was young and seeing the announcement of this series I did not care much about him but I saw him and then changed my view of him and I did not miss any episode and he is my parents and I became a fan of ninja and considered this series the best animated series I saw

It was not like the other animation series I was watching was each part linked to the other"

Trolley,No secret lasts forever,An incident from the past returns to haunt the wife of an ambitious politician which could falter his career. The series is very well acted as each episode exposes a new truth which leaves you wondering who are the good people and who are the bad. It all begins with a tragic incident involving their son and the plot goes on to twist and turn and draws you in. The side stories are interesting and the cast all do an excellent job as your initial opinion of some of the characters over time changes as their true nature is exposed. It is well written and I enjoyed the pace and the main character played by Kim Hyun Joo shows great strength as her life unravels.

Trolley,"Well-Acted, Well-Paced, at times frustrating but it delivers.","This show is one of the most intriguing I have come across in a very long time. Also proves why K-dramas are seen in such light.

The mysters is ever evolving, just when you think you've finally come to the bottom of a certain character's persona, something happens. Till episode 8th, the story has been very gripping with some new developments that shocked me to the core.

You just can never know someone well enough and this show is a testament to that. They depth in each character, the secrets they are hiding, and the their actions are such a tease.

One of my favourites. Definite recommend. If you dont like to wait for episodes airing every week, wait till it is released in full then binge it. Will be a much more satisfactory watch."
Trolley,The backbone is weak.,"The story telling is exceptionally good. They intertwine different parts of the story together very well, and also explores the two sides of every coin. However, the key concept behind the story was exceptional weak. It boils down to amending a particular law. No lawyers worth their salt, nor any sane persons would agree to whatever it was that this show was proposing or advocating. I just don't like it.

Fyi, if you charge a person with a crime, the accused must be alive to defend for himself/herself. If he dies during the 'investigation', he shouldn't be scapegoated into being the 'guilty' party."
Trolley,WOW drama,"Everything about this S Korean drama is top notch. The story moves along with no slow boring bits, actors are believable and really invested in their roles. Camera work is nothing spectacular, but then again, this isn't an art house film. Technically, 100% right.

The story, which is basically all a movie/series needs to keep the audience invested, is well written, with intelligent, believable conversations even while watching with subtitles.

I won't go into all the details of the two main families, but it's all twisted political intrigue, with flashback explanation helping carry the story.

Episode 12 - the last: Reality. I found myself shrieking at my TV. OMG NO!! That did not just happen!! Why, but hey, that's good TV. Worthy of the 12 hours you'll invest and the 9 stars I gave."
Trolley,The Truth is Never Wrong,"The moral of the story is that the truth is never wrong and you can't trust a man!! Was curious to watch this drama after watching the SBS Award Shows for K-Dramas and K-Drama Actors that was just held live on December 29, 2023 (you can still view it in it's entirety on Viki), and this particular drama was up for many awards - mostly for the acting parts of supporting actors and actresses. I watch a lot of dramas and this one escaped me somehow so after seeing so many nominations and some wins I had to watch it. Actually I was disappointed in the drama as a whole, but I can definitely agree with the 2 supporting actresses (the 2 young ones) Choi Myung-bin and the older girl who was pregnant and living with the assemblyman and his wife as being recognized at the SBS Award ceremony for their excellent acting. The drama was introduced at the award ceremony as a drama for middle agers which kind of offended me because it was so slow going and overly calm..........what do they think about middle agers? They are too slow so let's make this in 1/2 time? I didn't like a lot about how the main FL handled the infidelity episode - so calm and reserved, no emotion from her whatsoever until only the sea scene. There was no surprises; you could guess the ending way from the beginning due to the theme of the drama and clues all along - I guess the middle agers must be too slow to get a real twist so there is no real surprises so rating a 7 but kudos to the award winning actresses."
Trolley,Two episodes in and great expectations,"So far everything about this drama is just so gripping. I watched Park Hee-Soon in 'My Name' and absolutely loved him there (and the drama as a whole) he has not let me down in this drama either. I've only watched two episodes so far, the acting is fabulous, so much so that I actually don't know which actor to trust and believe are genuine. Can we also take a moment to appreciate the OST too. This drama is the first time I've come across Kim Hyun-joo, also great acting and I'm keen to find out what her secretive past is all about. All in all, if you like a drama that's a thriller, not too fast paced and definitely not too slow, showing a strong bond between husband and wife - this drama is for you!"

Trolley,Great k-drama,"This show has a gripping plot and credible storylines. Many classic k-drama elements have been seamlessly weaved in the story of this show.

Despite the change of an actress at the beginning, the cast has been well stocked with great actors and actresses. The performance of the cast has been all on point and powerful. Especially the lead actress, she deserves an award for her portrayal of the woman character. I have not heard of her before this drama but after this drama I found a recent movie of hers (Jung_E) on Netflix and enjoyed her performance in the movie too (maybe less than that in this drama but mainly because the movie's plot was less convincing).

Overall this drama is a must-see!!"
Trolley,Started off great but ended horribly,"The show started off interesting with a valid plot. The end just made no sense at all. It felt like the writer changed his mind last minute with where the story was heading. This made those plot twists make zero sense and really disappointing to watch. Really disliked all characters by the end....except Woo-Jae. He was pretty consistent throughout the series and I enjoyed that he ended out to be the fixer and adviser he started out to be until the very end. Also, writer must've forgot they wrote Joon to live away from home but he kept appearing in the house toward the end seeing multiple interactions. Just made no sense."
Trolley,A very Deep drama,"This drama is SO powerful. Not easily understood by many. The whole drama is as per the title. Referring to the Trolley dilemma. Every decision in the drama was based on this dilemma. The majority of people, when given this problem would sacrifice the one to save the majority but this drama highlighted the moral issue of sacrificing the one to save the majority. Who are we to make that decision? Is the one sacrificed not worthy of any notice? The drama can be slow in some episodes but hits so hard at the end and leaves viewers thinking. Highly recommended for thinkers. Writer should receive an award."
Trolley,Fine in every way,"I loved this story, every twist and turn of it. Wonderful writing, beautiful cinematography, and performances all around that knock your socks off. Where does Korea train all of their splendid actors? The woman playing Hye Joo is remarkable, with a performance so nuanced it breaks your heart. Themes of deception masked by earnest faces resonate, as do the explorations of people with initial good intentions losing their way in the thicket that is politics. Teenagers' passion, quests for what is true or real, play an important role in this drama, again handled exquisitely by the young actors. The treatment of sexual assault which motivates much of the action is raw and powerfully depicted. It's not ""too much"" as some might claim. Just ask anyone who has experienced this trauma, as have 38% of my friends and acquaintances and students. (And yes, when the ME TOO movement started, I took a random survey.) The casualness which the assaulters display about their actions falls in the ""what's the big deal"" category and is sickening. This is wonderful psychological thriller, carefully deliberate in pacing because these issues, and difficult, sometimes impossible, choices , require deliberation and a slower paced production."
Trolley,Supposed to be a good one but NOT REALLY!,"The story was supposed to be a good one but the decision of Ms. Kim was so below par only thinking of herself, the thoughts and sentiments of only 2 people and not her daughter and the rest of the society in general. I for one can't accept her decision, I find it selfish and not right. She could have moved forward of her choice when everything had been accomplished, thus even her daughter not suffering the harassment of her clasmates because of it. With that, everything could have been better for all concerned. It's a pity, it didn't materialized and the core of the story wasn't achieved. That's a pity."
Trolley,Lost it's way,"It had such a strong start. Meandered a bit in the middle and collapsed underneath sloppy and lazy tropes and writing in the end. Revelations were in fact given away very early and never fully fleshed out. My wife and I both looked at each other at one point in episode 8 and said, wait. They aren't going this route are they?! I mean, there are 8 more episodes. Alas, we were dead on and it was, in fact, where they went and it was laughable and sad. Laughable because it was such soddy story telling, but sad because we loved the fek and the actors did such a great job. Seriously. Don't waste 16 hours of your life on this. Use your head in episode 1 and you can save yourself a lot of time. I won't give away spoilers, however. Politician/man = bad. That formula tried and try every single time in this. Every."
Trolley,A waste of a great cast in a unbelievable stretched weak story.,"These coincidences that make people stay at the same hospital at the same time for the sake of a weak plot is just extremely bad!

When things start unfolding in episode 15 and 16, you wish that you haven't invested your time in a weak plot. From the very beginning, you can tell that there is something off about this show but you continue watching it hoping it will pick up at some stage. However, I quit watching it in episode 15 which is the one before the last episode. This show is a stigma to the korean drama. Netflix needs to classifiy this show as a korean comedy show instead of drama.

Finally, the absurdity in this show is next level and the writer of this show has zero respect to our intelligence."
Trolley,Absurd and unrealistic character development,"This tragic and depressing drama was barely watchable until episode 13. I continued watching, not because it was fun, but because I was curious how it would end. Suddenly, the major players' characters changed abruptly and unreasonably. The whole story line took a deep dive into the abyss. What a terrible and unrealistic plot! I felt defrauded by the writer. I give 3 stars because the actors and actresses do a good job, especially Kim Hyun Joo (who always delivers quality performances and is pleasant to watch). This drama is too long for what it is worth and should have ended in eight, not 16, episodes."
Trolley,Really? Explain to me,"All this for a law that will allow continued investigations even after the accused/perpetrator dies? Really?

A person commits suicide, which by definition is their own doing and their decision, and person who the family suspects ""pushed"" them is a murderer? And the general public, as one, thinks this? Please explain to me.

These two make this series just too unrealistic to the point of being weird. But, OK, I can forgive that since it is a drama, but I can't forgive the plot twists and turns that just make this unsatisfying to watch. Where's the denouement?

Finally, I find the acting of the husband and wife to be too understated to be unconvincing. That ""Yoon-seo is upstairs"" just doesn't cut it."
Trolley,A Sketchy Tramway,"They had a solid idea for a drama but they were totally clueless for how to fit it into a 16 episodes mold. The trolley dilemma was a poor idea to implement in the drama. They were afraid that the viewers may not notice so they went ahead to explain the trolley dilemma multiple times. The FL's kid was learning about it with visuals in school. Kinda insulting. Its finale execution of this analogy turned out to be disappointing and bland, especially after shoving it in our faces endlessly and having the drama named after it. Anyway, the drama was plagued by narrative and writing problems, especially with its horrible and dysfunctional characterization."
Trolley,Not Good Enough,"Korean Drama "" Trolley "" is a political- family melodrama. It centers around a woman who appears to be the perfect wife and mother, but she hides secrets that are about to come out.

The drama starts out quite intensely, and keeps things that way for some episodes. However, it starts deteriorating soon after, with the rest of the drama being boring and full of tropes. The twists were predictable and the plot kept dragging for no reason. In the end, everything was too messy to be set right smoothly.

At least the performances were enjoyable, especially by the leading lady.

So, overall, three out of ten."
Trolley,A deeply disturbing portrait of casual cruelty,"This drama is so slow-moving that a discernible plot doesn't start to develop until at least half way through. I had had trouble staying with the story also because all the main characters seem devoid of emotions. ""A stiff upper lip"" kept popping into my mind. As the story went on I couldn't continue to sympathize with the issue that it raised. Actions and reactions resulting in a swinging this way and that way of the movie's public opinion became more impressive than the issue. One character would post online or hold a press conference or privately say something about somebody and we - and the others in the movie - supposedly got worked up against the accused without any evidence until another character would say the opposite. And then we supposedly got worked up about THAT. Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. A young daughter in the story accuses her mother based on a blog! Finally, the plot started to pick up only to remove all of my sympathy for all of the characters for both their acting and their reacting by the end of episode 15. The story wore me down. Did the writers even know what they were doing? I can't think of a purpose to this story. I will enjoy not watching the last episode. I give three stars because the actors tried to keep me interested. My advice to you is not to waste your time."

Firefly Lane,Netflix adaptation of Fire Fly Lane is Near Perfection.,"I just finished binging this over a 24 hour period and honestly loved the whole thing. Having grown up in the 60's and 70's, I found it a realistic representation of that time period as well as the years past that. I had read the book and I spent way too much time waiting for certain events to happen before I realized there has to be another season. I wasn't sure about the casting at first, but in the end I thought the two main stars were perfect for their roles.

My problem is with some of the reviewers who freely admit to only watching a couple of episodes or in one case fifteen minutes. To admit this and then rate the show low doesn't seem fair-especially when it did take a bit to sort out all the characters, storylines and and time periods. Personally I had no problem with the timelines shifting back and forth. I get it, not everyone likes that in a show, and everyone has their own ideas of how it should be done. I was happy with it. Not only was I happy, I can't wait for season 2!"
Firefly Lane,Made me feel all the feels,"Not sure how my review will do this show justice but here we go... We follow Tully and Kate over 3 different timelines - as teenagers, as 20-30 somethings, in their 40s - with each decade's storyline cleverly intertwining across each episode. The timeline jumps around but it is so well done that it isn't confusing like some shows.

The casting is brilliant, Katherine Heigl and Sarah Chalke work beautifully together, as do the younger actresses cast to play their teenage selves.

And yes I cried. I don't think I got through a single episode in the second half of season 2 without bawling. I had read the book so I knew what was coming but seeing it all on screen made it even more emotional.

I also cried at the lack of a Kate/Tully relationship in my own life. Never had a friendship like they do in the show and that made me sad.

All in all a fantastic programme that will make you laugh, cry and reflect on your own life.

Oh and Dancing Queen will never sound the same again."
Firefly Lane,A knock on your face heartwarming series,"So many times this series hit spots of my own trauma at various times that caused me to rethink my values or where I sit with that in society. Not many series looks at life from a female perspective of friendship for decades, I can relate on various levels but also not as I've never experienced a best friend over such a long period of life. This series looks at the ups and downs of life in relationships and working careers, as well as how we grow with these over decades. How responsibility grows with this as an adult. I am not a parent, but I feel the emotions of people who have been raped as trauma at any early life (I've experienced that) and how that can impact you as you grow, and how always being the person who pleases people because you don't want to upset them in a marriage (that speaks into my marriage that broke down), and how do you weigh career in life versus personal feelings - no one ever gives you the rule book on this. This series speaks into various people's lives male and female, gay or straight from a perspective that many people go through. Cant't wait to see what season 3 brings."
Firefly Lane,Sobbing at the end and so moved by the beauty . . .,"Wish I could give an 11 or 12 rating for this series. I feel like I lived along with them and cared so much about everyone in the series that I was sobbing by the end. Outstanding performances by each cast member made this book come alive. I read the books, but really feel that the series was even better. Even with the gap in viewing it, I was able to pick up with the characters this week from where they left off. I have friends that are ""Tullys"" and friends that are ""Kate"". The depiction of the timeless deep love they have for each other was so moving. Bottom line message: Women need other women in their lives.

Thank you to everyone who put this impactful series together."
Firefly Lane,Binged all of season 1,"This is absolutely perfect in every way. The 80's flashbacks are spot on and full of nostalgia, and all the flashbacks caused no confusion it is done so well. Katherine Haigel and Sarah Chalke are perfect together, chemistry is amazing! Love everything about it. It is funny, sad, devastating, and so relatable!"

Firefly Lane,10 out of 10,"Absolutely loved this show....cannot wait for Season 2......

It is so well done, the characters were well rounded and believable....flaws and all ....and I loved the fashion and the music.......seriously good watching👍🏻👏👏👏"
Firefly Lane,Heigl is great-could this be the lift she needs,"This is a lovely show about friendship. Charming, sweet, it hits all the high notes.

Heigl is great. She really is such a good actor. Sarah Chalke puts in a solid performance-a little too cutesy.

Some of the script is a little too trite. I hated the stupid Manhattan clothing try-on montage. It made Chalke look so dopey. I wish screenwriters would stop with that stuff; it is so overdone.

Is it wrong to think of this as the Beaches of 2020s?

We haven't had a good friendship story in a long, long time. I did read one of the books in the series and the Netflix series does do a good job of interpreting the novel."

Firefly Lane,Truly incredible,"This show was incredible.

First of all the cast is great, beautiful female leads, representative of real women, not just dolled up and botoxed. They cast women and men of the right age to play the right part.

You could see the acting sometimes was just true feelings, i mean towards the end those tears just felt true.

I have not read the books so i cannot compare the two but damn the show was good.

This show has brought me to tears, it made me laugh, it goes through so many stages of life. I feel you can realate to the show because even if you haven't lived the same things, the base of life is still the same and shenanigans are still the same.

I got really attached to the characters even if each one were sometimes annoying, they were just portrayed as real people that are not always stable and that's life.

I just loved it!"
Firefly Lane,It's good but the book is better,The book that this series is based on is much more detailed and the story is better in my opinion
Firefly Lane,This Series is Barely Based on The Book,I love the books (Firefly Lane and Fly Away) and have looked forward to this series for months! Pretty quickly into the first episode book readers realize these characters that you love from the books have been given a totally different story in the series. I just wish that I had been warned not to expect the story in the books I loved (and spent hours crying with) in this series.
Firefly Lane,Loved it! Top 10 favorite!,"Really loved this show and will be anxiously waiting for season 2! Acting is great and it is fun to watch Katherine Heigl again! I thought the chemistry between alI the characters was spot on. The actors that play Tully and Kate as teenagers are fabulous. I do think the writing lacked a tiny bit, but it did not stop me from enjoying the show and being entertained. The back and forth between past and present is well done and not confusing. Binge worthy!"
Firefly Lane,Love this show,I needed a story and characters I could get lost in and enjoy. Firefly Lane delivers and its fun watching as the storyline unfolds.
Firefly Lane,Brilliant,"There's far too many ""saw it coming, it's been done before, oh those characters were annoying"" reviews.... I personally thoroughly enjoyed Firefly lane, I enjoyed it all! I thought the writing and the storyline was beautifully done, I felt connected with the characters. The actors/actresses really impressed! It was fun, loving, cringey, heartbreaking, annoying... everything I wanted from it! A tale of love and true friendship right until the end!! This is my own opinion, and rather than listen to those of others, you make up your own mind I found a good feeling from this programme and I WILL watch it again. Loved it! How the story rolls out, great imagination behind it. Top marks from me."
Firefly Lane,A great TV show,"I loved this show. I wasn't too sure on the first episode but it just got better and better. So emotional and such good chemistry between the actors. Definitely worth a watch! The best acting I've seen from Katherine Heigl, the part was made for her. Enough time was spent on developing the characters that you actually care what happens to them, unlike many other shows I have watched. The editing was great, flicking seamlessly between different times and the use of the same actors was fine as they used different hairstyles etc to show the different times. Top show, definitely recommend you watch it!"
Firefly Lane,Not fair.,"Great show until the final episode where we are left with a bombshell development that comes out of nowhere and lots of loose ends. I understand leaving some questions to build a new season with but this was way too much. Would have been a 9 or 10. Sucks.

PS. I read some reviews of the book to get an idea of what happened. I am going to avoid season 2 like the plague and I'm sure I'm not the only one."
Firefly Lane,OMG I never cry this much before,"I loved this show. It is funny, and its serious, and its real :-) It is very well played by the leading roles, and it has been long since I laughed out loud so much, and I do not think that I have ever cried as hard and much as I did through the last episodes of season 2. I actially had to watch the last 2 episodes over many days, because I could not stand crying so much :-)

Its a wonderful story about the kind of friendship we all wish we had. Some are lucky enough to have experienced it, others may experience it through this fantastic story. And its about how different we can be as human beings, and still find each other.

Thank you to the writers and to the cast for giving me a really great time watching."
Firefly Lane,Easy To Walk Away,"This series starts out interesting and engaging unfortunately it doesn't stay that way. I've walked alway numerous times with no desire to return until I'm bored and with nothing else to watch. The frequent sex scenes are predictable, redundant and unnecessary fillers. I would've enjoyed the story more without them. The storyline is good but the constant interruptions is annoying and made my interest lessen. The actors are perfect for their roles and performed well. My last perception is, if you don't like jumping from the characters 3 different stages of life, then don't watch this. It's a constant back and forth."
Firefly Lane,Besties,"This is such a good show. I laughed, I cried, it reminds me of the bond and when I say bond with my best friend I mean -> we are closer than sisters. I remember reading this book. Katherine Hiegel is a great actress and so is Sarah Chalke. The portrayal of besties growing up makes you smile and think about yours. Have tissues there's sad parts. It's a great show to watch with your bestie, hell even if your best is a guy. just watch it. Oh season 2 please :)"
Firefly Lane,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"Full of cliches, hard to follow time jumps from present to past, and bad parenting! When a scene starts, you know what's going to happen in the end! The supposedly funny parts have all been done before and again you know the outcome so they're not funny."
Firefly Lane,Long Hallmark movie,"It starts off strong, but then disintegrates into sappy stereotypical hallmark movie. The actors for both the adult and the teen characters of Tully and Kate are the only thing that kept me watching. Heigl, Chalke, Skovbye, and Curtis ate GREAT! Otherwise, whiplash between decades, cliche or way too on-the-nose parallels and situations, uneven direction etc made me roll my eyes way too often. I also didn't realize it was an actual series, not a limited run. Soooo, now I have to consider whether I cut my losses or continue to roll my eyes in the second season."
Firefly Lane,Wanted to love it,Why would they change so much about this story? Unnecessary changes. I wanted it to be a little closer to the book. Oh well. Could have been great!

PJ Masks,Repetitive,"My son loves it, learned who the characters were by the 2nd episode in and with him being delayed in speech, that's great for us. HOWEVER, every episode the plot is the same. Save the day, but there's always that ONE character that screws up the mission 3-6x's before realizing ""oh, that's right! I'm suppose to be a hero, better act like it instead of acting so dumb..."" it hurts my head to watch, but my son loves it so I guess I can spare a few brain cells listening to it."
PJ Masks,the Disney equivalent of super why,"I think this show is solid, but very repetitive. Definitely better than Teen Titans GO!, but I wish it could be up to the standards of PBS Kids."
PJ Masks,"Gets old fast, sadly. Spoiler alert.",Comentario no disponible
PJ Masks,No doubt the most annoying kids show,Comentario no disponible
PJ Masks,Shallow,"One of the shallowest and most merchandise centric kids shows that I've seen recently. The creators have clearly tried to hide morals in each episode (confidence in oneself, teamwork, etc.) but they take the backseat next to special effects and other tricks to get the kids hooked. Luckily we have managed to steer clear of this show eventually, thanks to better alternatives."
PJ Masks,A Decent Show That Could Be Better,"Take it from a teen fan of this show. It's alright. The writing is good, the animation is good, the background music is surprisingly very good, the voice acting is decent, there's a fair amount of action which is entertaining to watch, and there is a good moral/lesson in almost every episode.

Only real problems are: the police never try to stop the nighttime villains, we don't know why or how the villains became villains, there's no backstory of the PJ Masks' powers, HQ, vehicles, or how they met.

Also the consistency is pretty bad in most episodes. Like one scene there are sticky splats, flags, or holes in the ground and in the very next shot they are gone without any explanation other than the animators are too lazy to be consistent and animate it."
PJ Masks,I Still Like It,Comentario no disponible
PJ Masks,Nearly Unwatchable,"Do your sanity a favor a DON'T let your kids watch this show. It's trash. Obnoxious, repetitive, boring, ugly animations. The moral is essentially the same every time, but the execution is so poor that it actually shows kids several problematic behaviors along the way. I cannot stress enough how annoying this show is! Worse than Paw Patrol and Super Wings. Alternate recommendations: True and the Rainbow Kingdom (for littles), Octonauts, Dinotrux (some may find this too violent, so preview first)"
PJ Masks,One Of The Funniest Super Hero Shows I've Seen,"I've been seeing super hero shows since I was really young. But if there's a show that involves super heroes and is really comical, it's PJ Masks. While there's technology and powers, the heroes and even the villains would sometimes get silly. This is a decent yet funny show for all ages."
PJ Masks,Awfully repetitive,"This is a show where i can agree, its repetitive but i also can't not say i dont enjoy this"
PJ Masks,Disappointing and inappropriate for children IMO,"Ya know, being this is on the lowest rating option available on Disney+ for children means it's suppose to be appropriate for young children, I'd say 4 and up, however, the way these characters talk to one and other is highly inappropriate. The ""villain"" is not only a villain but a HUGE bully. All he does is literally mock and bully the PJ mask. There is a LOT of name calling in it, which, frankly, I would not want my child to copy and let's face it, tv is very influential and children and adults learn a lot from tv, whether it be new slang words or attitudes.

This show is disappointing with how much bullying and name calling is happening. If I didn't have to give any stars, I wouldn't."
PJ Masks,It's a kids show guys.,I'm only writing a review because of reading all of these adults bashing this show as if it's for them. It's a cute show. My toddler loves it. He was born over 2 months premature and has struggled with being behind his age in some areas. The main one is speech. This show and a few others have really helped him come out of his shell and talk more. Their nightly adventures are fun and the theme song is catchy. :)
PJ Masks,"I love the PJ Masks, but some improvements are needed","I love the PJ Masks series, I adore the characters Connor, Amaya and Greg very much, that is, Catboy, Owlette and Gekko, although my favorite character is Amaya / Owlette. The stories given per episode are intended to teach moral lessons, from being patient to helping each other and others. I love the PJ Masks very much, that is why I qualify as a series that is revolutionizing the world for the theme of superheroes as if they were made by Marvel and DC Comics But there are villain issues that some people qualify as annoying characters, that's the problem.

However, there are some points that consider an average series, such as that the villains repeat all the episodes, the characters can show off each other, there are episodes that can become annoying or boring, etc.

That is why you have to create a new plot, based on Romuald's books or other series and superhero movies, create more villains, add new heroes, from child heroes to adult heroes, and create fantastic adventures.

7 out of 10, despite this rating, I rate the PJ Masks as a revolutionary preschool series PJ Masks, it's time to be a hero for all the children of the world."
PJ Masks,Excuse me WTF?,"This show repeats itself over and over. The story sucks, the background sucks, the main charecters suck, the villains are freacking annoying. I don't reccomend this show at all costs."
PJ Masks,Almost Worse Heroes than Aquaman,"Somehow, these kids turn into superheroes at night to fight their classmates who turn into supervillains at night. How do they become these heroes/villains? I don't know. I dont think it's ever been explained. Basically, the same thing happens every episode so it's pretty boring. Still, if this serves as a precursor to getting my kid into real superhero stuff, I guess I can tolerate it. I have to ask, though, where are these kids' parents?!"
PJ Masks,Repetitive.... extremely,"At first it was cute, but now it's annoying. The story is the same in EVERY EPISODE. I can't stand when it comes on but my 3 year old likes to watch it when it is. I know Disney normally had a 4 season cap on tv shows but they need to term in now and try something else."
PJ Masks,So ugly!,"Watching cheap British animation, probably made somewhere in Asia, in the 1990s and early 2000s was somehow justified: any excuse to make low cost entertainment to keep the children enough in front of the screen as to watch the next batch of adverts. But 2015 and the same terrible animation plus an even lower quality script? No, thank you."
PJ Masks,An average superhero show,This show streams in disney junior so I bet its like chuggington season 6 I have heard about this show and seen it a million times since the past 2 years that does't mean I hate the show I never watchted any of the episodes I have heard Its a superhero show and would watch it sometime in the future but please dont end the show because after I finish the old ones and think its great then I might want the show to keep going on and I dont mean by after I watch I mean now incase I like it.
PJ Masks,God I wish my niece wasn't watching this,"Worst thing I've seen in years - no children's TV show should be about fighting the other children in your class - and the merchandise is endless.

Its endlessly repetitive and boring, cheaply made with barely any effort put into it. There are so many other television shows for children and all of them are better.

A children's program should teach some life and behavioural lessons but the only lesson taught here is ""don't be an idiot""

There are events, albums, toys and more. It's the most shameless money making exercise I've come across (well except for the current British conservative party).

Also the soundtrack MAKES MY EARS BLEED."
PJ Masks,Layers of excellence,"My 3-year-old son absolutely loves this show. As a music educator, I see so many levels of excellence: music (writing, musicality), awareness of self and others, teamwork, apologizing, cool costumes, no violence, thinking through a challenge to find a solution, etc. I'm so happy there are shows like this that my son can watch on his own and I don't have to give commentary because I don't like something that's happening on the show. We quote the show often, and my son's favorite character is the Gecko. He even says his little sister is Owlette. Ha! I'm looking forward to all the merchandise to come out. We will certainly be ready to purchase! I'm also looking forward to new episodes since we watch over and over and over... :)"
PJ Masks,"I love the PJ Masks, but improvements are needed","I love the PJ Masks series, I adore the characters Connor, Amaya and Greg very much, that is, Catboy, Owlette and Gekko, although my favorite character is Amaya / Owlette. The stories given per episode are intended to teach moral lessons, from being patient to helping each other and others.

I love the PJ Masks very much, that is why I qualify as a series that is revolutionizing the world for the theme of superheroes as if they were made by Marvel and DC Comics

But there are villain issues that some people qualify as annoying characters, that's the problem.

However, there are some points that consider an average series, such as that the villains repeat all the episodes, the characters can show off each other, there are episodes that can become annoying or boring, etc.

That is why you have to create a new plot, based on Romuald's books or other series and superhero movies, create more villains, add new heroes, from child heroes to adult heroes, and create fantastic adventures.

7 out of 10, despite this rating, I rate the PJ Masks as a revolutionary preschool series

PJ Masks, it's time to be a hero for all the children of the world."
PJ Masks,Terrible,"I hate this show. My 6-year-old brother loves this show and will turn the volume on my TV to super loud when watching it.

The voice actors and the annoying theme song are only two of the things that make me hate this awful. The only thing good about it is when it ends. Most of the things that happen make hardly any sense.

It is my most hated television show. That is weird for Disney, as most of Disney's stuff is good."
PJ Masks,we love Pj Masks,I am happy to say I am a fan of the super-hero cartoon and when my sons age 4 and 2 years starting watching the PJ Masks I was moved. They love Cat-Boy and Gekko and tell me that I will be Owelette. PJ Masks is a really cute crime fighting trio that deals with everyday challenges of working together with others. This show encourages teamwork and teaches sportsmanship. Pj Masks also display that children get caught up in there own interests but when teamwork is required to fight crime they come together. My husband and I are really grateful for the creators of this show as it values children's innocence. We also look forward to seeing more episodes and wish the best for this TV series.
PJ Masks,Bunch of garrulous bloated orphans,"Not so long ago, superheros in kid cartoons were just working alongside with regular human law enforcement to help then with things they just couldn't: Superman, Captain America, The Mighty Thor, Batman,... and they DID NOT TALK MUCH. The technical aspects of kid programs, despite software advancements have deteriorated and thus, to compensate for the story they can't tell with pictures, the characters just need to talk a whole lot more instead. This is unfortunately a universal problem with all kids and junior programs these days. Almost no one has a family, bunch of kids just suddenly turning into super hero and talk their way into our brains."
PJ Masks,Content and language too strong for average age audience,"The premise is too strong with violent orientation to be acceptable for children under the age of 5. The language is also strong, ""doe doe and loser"" are unnecessary and if the writers and producers are listening - please note that name-calling is not OK, nor is ""fighting crime"" - your average viewer is approximately 3 years old. The character animation is compelling for toddlers and so the story line or show's premise should match the audience it's in fact capturing. The show could be a delightful and welcomed hit if it were toned down for a younger age viewer. It's become an unavoidable fight in our home if our 2.5 year old is in the room and the characters come across the screen. We will not allow him to watch the new series even though he is incredibly interested and drawn to the animation. It's a shame to have to tell him it's not an appropriate program until he's much older."
